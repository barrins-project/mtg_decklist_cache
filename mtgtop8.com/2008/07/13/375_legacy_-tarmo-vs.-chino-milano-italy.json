It combines elements of control and combo playstyles to create a versatile approach. Key cards include Aether Vial, Force of Will, and Brainstorm for control, while Survival of the Fittest acts as a toolbox to find the right creature for the situation. Show and Tell is used to cheat out powerful creatures, and there are various creatures with powerful abilities to provide additional utility and win conditions. The deck also includes a Living Wish to access additional cards from the sideboard."
