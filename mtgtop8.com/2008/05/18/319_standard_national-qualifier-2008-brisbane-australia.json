Swans of Bryn Argoll is used to prevent the player from taking damage from the discarding lands. Glittering Wish allows access to additional cards from the sideboard that can help control the game. Lotus Bloom and Manamorphose help with mana acceleration, while Firespout and Sulfurous Blast provide board control. The deck is designed to be versatile and aggressive, aiming to disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up the win condition with Seismic Assault."

The deck aims to outvalue opponents by efficiently exchanging resources and controlling the tempo of the game, ultimately overwhelming opponents with a combination of faeries and powerful spells."
