It uses powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf and Eternal Witness to apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Cabal Therapy helps to strip the opponent's hand of key cards while Pernicious Deed acts as a board wipe. The deck also features various toolbox creatures like Shriekmaw and Harmonic Sliver to deal with specific threats. The end goal is to outvalue the opponent and eventually assemble a game-winning combo."
