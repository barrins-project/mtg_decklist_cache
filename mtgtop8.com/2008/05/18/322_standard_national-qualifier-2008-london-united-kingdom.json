The deck also includes some flexibility with cards like Kitchen Finks for lifegain and Mutavault for additional creatures. Overall, the strategy is to quickly overwhelm and burn down the opponent while maintaining board presence with efficient creatures."

Additionally, having counterspells like Rune Snag and Mystic Snake allows you to control the game and protect your key combo pieces.
