By buffing up creatures like Stinkdrinker Bandit and Oona's Blackguard, and combining them with evasion from cards like Squeaking Pie Sneak and Nightshade Stinger, this deck aims to chip away at the opponent's life total while disrupting their strategy with cards like Nameless Inversion and Profane Command. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Bitterblossom and Earwig Squad provide additional utility and flexibility in different situations."
