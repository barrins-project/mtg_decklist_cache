The inclusion of cards like Avalanche Riders, Fulminator Mage, and Magus of the Moon disrupt the opponent's mana base, while cards like Garruk Wildspeaker and Birds of Paradise help ramp up your own mana production. The overall strategy is to overwhelm your opponent with efficient threats and keep them on the back foot through disruptive land destruction."
