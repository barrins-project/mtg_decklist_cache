The deck also features versatile removal in Lightning Bolt and Fire / Ice to handle threats. The inclusion of Fledgling Dragon adds a flying threat to the mix. The deck aims to control the tempo of the game with efficient card draw and manipulation with Brainstorm and Ponder, supported by fetch lands like Flooded Strand and Polluted Delta for mana fixing."
