By consistently generating Faerie tokens through Bitterblossom and Scion of Oona, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent while maintaining a strong defense. The deck also includes ways to pump up its creatures and protect them from removal spells. The key strategy is to outvalue the opponent by efficiently using Faerie synergies and countering key spells."
