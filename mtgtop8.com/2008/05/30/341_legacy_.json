Additionally, the presence of cards like Moat and Ghostly Prison provide additional protection and defense. The deck aims to lock down the opponent's options and slowly grind out a victory through attrition and control."

The deck aims to utilize fast mana from cards like Ancient Tomb and Seething Song to power out its game-ending threats, all while maintaining pressure on the opponent with cards like Gathan Raiders and Umezawa's Jitte. Overall, the deck seeks to lock down the board and close out the game quickly with its aggressive dragon-centric strategy."
