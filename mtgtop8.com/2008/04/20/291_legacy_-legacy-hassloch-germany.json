By locking down the opponent's resources and disrupting their strategy, the deck aims to gradually grind out a win condition. Crucible of Worlds and Wasteland provide additional resource denial, while cards like Smokestack and Armageddon can further cripple the opponent's board state. The inclusion of artifacts like Mox Diamond and Ancient Tomb enable the deck to quickly ramp into its powerful prison effects, making it difficult for the opponent to mount a successful offense."
