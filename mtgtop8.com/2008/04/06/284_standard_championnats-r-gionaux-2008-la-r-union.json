Cards like Lord of Atlantis and Silvergill Adept help pump up the team while Sower of Temptation and Sygg, River Guide provide additional control elements. Ancestral Vision provides card advantage while Mirror Entity can act as a finisher. Faerie Conclave and Mutavault offer additional creature threats on the board."
