It uses cards like Rune Snag and Riftwing Cloudskate to disrupt the opponent's plans while generating card advantage with Mulldrifter and Careful Consideration. Reveillark and Aven Riftwatcher provide value through recurring creatures and lifegain, while Sower of Temptation and Mirror Entity help to steal and pump up creatures. The deck can also create a versatile game plan with cards like Momentary Blink and Venser, Shaper Savant, allowing for flexibility in different matchups."
