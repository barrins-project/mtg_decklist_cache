Cards like Siege-Gang Commander and Goblin Sharpshooter provide additional firepower and control options to further cement the deck's dominance on the battlefield. With a solid mana base and disruptive cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port, the goblin aggro deck seeks to outpace and overpower the opponent in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
