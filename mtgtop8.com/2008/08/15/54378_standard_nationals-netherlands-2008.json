The inclusion of Teferi and Venser adds additional disruption to the opponent's spells and allows for more flexibility in playing and countering spells. Swans of Bryn Argoll provide card draw when dealt damage, further increasing the deck's card advantage."

Cards like Pact of Negation and Wrath of God help maintain control of the board, while creatures like Sower of Temptation and Venser, Shaper Savant provide additional removal options. The deck also utilizes card draw and recursion through cards like Mulldrifter and Reveillark to ensure card advantage and maintain pressure on the opponent. Additionally, mana ramp with Coldsteel Heart and Mind Stone allows for quicker access to higher-cost spells."
