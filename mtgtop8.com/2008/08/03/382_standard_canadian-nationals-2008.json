The deck also utilizes efficient removal spells like Nameless Inversion and Shriekmaw to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Imperious Perfect provides additional value by generating tokens, while cards like Thoughtseize and Garruk Wildspeaker offer disruption and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early on while maintaining resources and answering threats efficiently."
