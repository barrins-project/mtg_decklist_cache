By utilizing efficient creatures like Figure of Destiny and Demigod of Revenge, along with direct damage spells like Incinerate and Flame Javelin, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. Additionally, cards like Magus of the Moon disrupt the opponent's mana base, giving this deck a further advantage in the early game. The overall strategy is to be fast, punishing, and unrelenting in attacking the opponent's life total."
