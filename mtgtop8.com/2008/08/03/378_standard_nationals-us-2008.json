Ancestral Vision helps draw cards for more control options. Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir provides additional control and Cloudthresher can take out flying threats. Chameleon Colossus and Tarmogoyf are the main win conditions, with support from Firespout for board control. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistent access to all colors needed for control and threats."
