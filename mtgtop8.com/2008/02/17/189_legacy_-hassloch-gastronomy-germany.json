The deck utilizes small, efficient creatures like Goblin Lackey and Goblin Piledriver to apply pressure early on, while also having access to powerful abilities like Goblin Ringleader's card advantage and Goblin Sharpshooter's pinging effect. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Rishadan Port and Wasteland to slow down the opponent's mana development. Overall, the deck aims to establish a fast board presence and maintain it through a combination of efficient creatures and disruptive spells."
