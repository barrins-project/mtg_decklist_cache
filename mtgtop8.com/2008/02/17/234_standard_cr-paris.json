Additionally, the deck focuses on utilizing creatures with enter the battlefield abilities like Mulldrifter and Riftwing Cloudskate, along with cards like Momentary Blink and Reveillark to maximize their value. The deck also includes some mana fixing and card draw to ensure consistency in executing its game plan. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue and outpace your opponent while maintaining board control."
