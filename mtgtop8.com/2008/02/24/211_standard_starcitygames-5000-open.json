It utilizes creatures with powerful enters-the-battlefield effects like Mulldrifter and Reveillark, which can be repeatedly bounced back to your hand for value. The inclusion of Mirror Entity offers a potential win condition by pumping up your creatures. The deck also includes ways to fix mana with Prismatic Lens and Venser, Shaper Savant for additional disruption. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through efficient plays."
