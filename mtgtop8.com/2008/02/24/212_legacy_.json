The goal is to quickly get to seven mana, activate Goblin Charbelcher, and use its ability to win the game instantly by revealing cards from the top of the library. The deck has a high level of redundancy to ensure consistency in executing the combo, while also including some alternate win conditions like Empty the Warrens and Burning Wish."
