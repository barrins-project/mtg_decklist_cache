The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by recurring powerful creatures like Mulldrifter and Mirror Entity, while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Venser, Shaper Savant. Additionally, the deck utilizes snow lands and synergies like Aven Riftwatcher and Mouth of Ronom for additional value and versatility."
