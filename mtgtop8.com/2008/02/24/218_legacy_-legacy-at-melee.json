This combo allows the player to mill their entire library, returning Narcomoebas to the battlefield and ultimately bringing back a lethal creature like Sutured Ghoul. The deck also includes control elements like Force of Will and Counterbalance to protect the combo, alongside efficient threats like Tarmogoyf. With a strong mana base and card selection through Brainstorm and Sensei's Divining Top, the deck aims to win the game quickly and decisively."

The goal is to eventually overwhelm the opponent with a combination of enchantments, mana acceleration, and card advantage, leading to a win condition like Replenish or Hoofprints of the Stag. The deck also includes some disruption and protection cards like Ground Seal and Sterling Grove."
