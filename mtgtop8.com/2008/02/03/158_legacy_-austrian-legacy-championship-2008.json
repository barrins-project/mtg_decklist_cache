The key strategy is to maintain control of the game by managing resources effectively, using lands like Mishra's Factory and manlands to apply pressure when needed. The inclusion of Pernicious Deed and Engineered Explosives allows for board wipes against opposing threats, while cards like Decree of Justice and Academy Ruins provide alternate win conditions and recursion capabilities. Overall, the deck excels at outlasting opponents and grinding out victories."

By dredging cards like Stinkweed Imp and Golgari Grave-Troll, the player can easily put cards like Narcomoeba, Ichorid, and Bridge from Below into play. This allows for explosive plays with cards like Dread Return and Flame-Kin Zealot, resulting in a combo-based win condition. Additionally, cards like Cabal Therapy and Gemstone Mine provide disruption and mana fixing to ensure the deck can consistently execute its game plan."
