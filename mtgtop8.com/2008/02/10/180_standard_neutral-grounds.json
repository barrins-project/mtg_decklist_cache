It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of creatures and control the board with cards like Oblivion Ring and Wrath of God. The inclusion of Mutavault adds versatility to the deck, allowing for surprise creature activations. The deck also has some token generation with Militia's Pride and Kinsbaile Borderguard to increase the pressure on the opponent."
