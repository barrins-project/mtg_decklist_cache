            "notes": "This Legacy Goblins deck focuses on quickly deploying low-cost Goblins using Goblin Lackey and Aether Vial to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Gempalm Incinerator and Earwig Squad to remove threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Rishadan Port and Wasteland help to control the opponent's mana base, while Goblin Ringleader provides card advantage to keep the pressure on. The deck can end games quickly with big swings from creatures like Goblin Goon."
