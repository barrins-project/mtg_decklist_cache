The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Sudden Spoiling. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Profane Command allows the deck to close out the game once it has established dominance on the battlefield. Additionally, the deck utilizes powerful lands like Mutavault and Treetop Village to further strengthen its board presence."
