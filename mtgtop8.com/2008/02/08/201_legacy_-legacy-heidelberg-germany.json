By utilizing cards such as Stifle, Force of Will, and Daze to counter or stall your opponent's spells, you can establish an early advantage to push through damage with creatures like Nimble Mongoose and Tarmogoyf. With efficient card draw from Ponder and Brainstorm, along with removal spells like Lightning Bolt, this deck aims to maintain tempo and pressure to secure a victory."

By using discard spells like Duress and Hymn to Tourach, along with disruptive spells like Sinkhole and Wasteland, the deck seeks to strip away the opponent's resources. Meanwhile, creatures like Nantuko Shade and Hypnotic Specter provide a fast clock to close out the game. The inclusion of removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Vindicate help deal with any threats that may arise, allowing the deck to maintain its aggressive strategy."
