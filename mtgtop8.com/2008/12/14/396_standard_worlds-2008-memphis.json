The deck includes a strong faerie creature theme, utilizing cards like Bitterblossom, Mistbind Clique, and Spellstutter Sprite to generate value and maintain control. The deck also includes a suite of powerful counterspells like Cryptic Command and Broken Ambitions to further disrupt the opponent's plays. Overall, the deck aims to establish a dominant position on the board while limiting the opponent's options and resources."
