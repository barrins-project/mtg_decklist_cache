By using cards that can be returned from the graveyard like Life from the Loam and Genesis, you can outlast your opponent and eventually close out the game with powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Engineered Explosives. By utilizing this combination of control and resource management, you can outmaneuver your opponent and secure victory."
