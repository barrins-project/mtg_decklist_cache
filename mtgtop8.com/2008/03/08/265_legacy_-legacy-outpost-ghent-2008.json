            "notes": "The main concept of this Deadguy Ale deck is to disrupt the opponent's hand and mana base while applying pressure with efficient threats like Tarmogoyf and Nantuko Shade. By combining discard spells like Hymn to Tourach and Duress with land destruction like Sinkhole and Wasteland, the deck aims to control the game and pave the way for its creatures to finish off the opponent. Additionally, the deck utilizes versatile removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Vindicate to deal with threats efficiently and maintain board advantage."
