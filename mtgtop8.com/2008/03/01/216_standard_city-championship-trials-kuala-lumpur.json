It also utilizes blink effects like Momentary Blink to reuse powerful enter the battlefield abilities from creatures like Riftwing Cloudskate and Venser, Shaper Savant. The deck also has a mild tribal theme with Faeries, utilizing cards like Faerie Conclave and Mirror Entity to put pressure on the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and outvalue the opponent through efficient creature recursion and blink effects."
