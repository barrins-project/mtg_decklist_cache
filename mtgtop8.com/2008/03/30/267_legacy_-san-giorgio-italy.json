Cards like Goblin Warchief and Goblin Piledriver help to pump up the goblin creatures, while Goblin Matron and Goblin Ringleader provide card advantage and consistency. Additionally, the deck includes disruption elements like Wasteland and Rishadan Port to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient aggro strategy using goblin creatures."
