This allows you to bring back powerful creatures like Narcomoeba and Ichorid with cards like Dread Return and Bridge from Below. The deck also includes ways to discard cards for value, such as Cabal Therapy and Lion's Eye Diamond. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with a flood of creatures and win the game before they can establish their own game plan."
