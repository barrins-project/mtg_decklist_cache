The key strategy involves utilizing cards like Llanowar Elves and Wolf-Skull Shaman to accelerate mana production, while also using cards like Wren's Run Vanquisher and Imperious Perfect to pump up elves and create a strong board presence. Cards like Tarmogoyf and Garruk Wildspeaker provide additional threat and utility, making it a versatile and aggressive deck capable of outpacing opponents in the early to mid-game."
