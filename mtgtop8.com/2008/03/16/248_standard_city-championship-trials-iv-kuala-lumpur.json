The deck focuses on creating a swarm of elves and pumping them up with anthems like Bramblewood Paragon and Imperious Perfect, as well as using Overrun to overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of Chameleon Colossus provides a massive threat, while cards like Civic Wayfinder help fix mana and Profane Command provide versatile removal and finisher potential. Garruk Wildspeaker adds additional ramp and support."
