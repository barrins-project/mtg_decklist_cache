The deck combines traditional control elements like Wasteland and Thoughtseize with a graveyard-centric strategy to disrupt the opponent's game plan while presenting threats like Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant. Burning Wish is included for additional versatility and access to sideboard cards, adding an extra layer of control to the deck."
