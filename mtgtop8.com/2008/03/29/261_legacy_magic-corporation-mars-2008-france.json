The deck also includes traditional control elements like Terminate and Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Burning Wish adds versatility by allowing the player to access sideboard cards when needed. The deck's win condition is either overwhelming the opponent with creatures like Tarmogoyf and Tombstalker, or locking them out of the game with powerful spells like Devastating Dreams and Pernicious Deed."

With Lion's Eye Diamond and Dread Return, you can bring back powerful creatures like Flame-Kin Zealot or Sundering Titan to finish off your opponent.
