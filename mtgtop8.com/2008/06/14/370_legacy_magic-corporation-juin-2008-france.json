The deck aims to apply consistent pressure on the opponent by playing aggressive creatures like Nimble Mongoose and Werebear, which benefit from the deck's graveyard manipulation cards like Mental Note and Brainstorm. The deck's mana base consists of fetchlands and dual lands to ensure consistent access to the necessary colors of mana. Additionally, the inclusion of Isochron Scepter allows for repeatable use of certain spells."

Utilizing cards like Wasteland and Crucible of Worlds to disrupt your opponent's mana base and maintaining control with counterspells like Counterspell and Force of Will are essential to the deck's success. Eternal Dragon provides a late-game threat and card advantage, while Wrath of God and Swords to Plowshares deal with problematic creatures."
