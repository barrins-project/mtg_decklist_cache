This synergy is further strengthened by cards like Raven Familiar and Wall of Blossoms, which can draw you additional resources. The deck also includes disruption elements like Cabal Therapy and Pernicious Deed to control the board state while setting up your combo. Overall, the goal is to assemble your combo pieces and overwhelm your opponent with a quick and powerful sequence of plays."

The deck includes key cards such as Brainstorm, Force of Will, and Duress to control the opponent's plays and protect the combo. Trinket Mage and Fabricate help tutor for important pieces, while cards like Dark Confidant provide card advantage. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Pithing Needle and Tormod's Crypt to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck focuses on assembling the combo pieces quickly and efficiently to win the game."
