The inclusion of cards like Force of Will and Daze provide additional protection, while Mutavault and Vedalken Shackles offer additional utility. The deck aims to maintain board control and disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up card advantage through spells like Brainstorm and Ancestral Vision. It utilizes a mix of traditional control elements and Faerie tribal synergies to outmaneuver opponents in a Legacy 1 vs 1 setting."
