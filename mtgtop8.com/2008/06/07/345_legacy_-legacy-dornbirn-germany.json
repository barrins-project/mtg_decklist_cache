By quickly dealing damage with cards like Flames of the Blood Hand, Lightning Bolt, and Lava Spike, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan. The inclusion of creatures like Keldon Marauders and Mogg Fanatic helps to maintain pressure on the opponent while also providing additional reach with cards like Shrapnel Blast. Overall, this deck aims to win the game as fast as possible through direct damage."
