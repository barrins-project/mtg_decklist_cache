The goal is to disrupt opponents' game plans with counterspells like Cryptic Command and steal key threats with Sower of Temptation. Lord of Atlantis and Merrow Reejerey provide anthem effects and mana acceleration, while Ancestral Vision refills your hand. Mutavault can become a creature to benefit from Lord of Atlantis and activate Mirror Entity for a game-ending alpha strike. Stonybrook Banneret helps reduce the cost of your Merfolk spells."
