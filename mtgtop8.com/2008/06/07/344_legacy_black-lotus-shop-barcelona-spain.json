Using cards like Infernal Tutor and Tendrils of Agony, the deck aims to chain together spells to deal lethal damage to the opponent in one turn. The inclusion of counterspells like Force of Will and Pact of Negation helps protect the combo from disruption. The deck also includes cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder to help find key pieces of the combo."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on using Stifle to counter powerful abilities and play Phyrexian Dreadnought, which becomes a massive threat due to its low cost and high power. Control elements such as Force of Will, Daze, and Thoughtseize help disrupt the opponent's strategy, while cards like Dark Confidant and Brainstorm provide card advantage and selection. Wasteland is used to disrupt the opponent's mana base, while Sensei's Divining Top helps with card selection. Smother and Fling provide additional removal and options for getting rid of threats, making it a versatile and disruptive control deck."
