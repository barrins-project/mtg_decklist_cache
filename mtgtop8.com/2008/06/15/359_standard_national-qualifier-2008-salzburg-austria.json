By combining the evasive abilities of the Faerie creatures with powerful spells like Cryptic Command, the deck aims to keep the opponent's board in check while chipping away at their life total. With a mix of card advantage engines like Bitterblossom and Ancestral Vision, the deck can outgrind opponents in longer games. The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building up a board presence of evasive threats."
