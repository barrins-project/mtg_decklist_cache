With a focus on dealing damage to the opponent's life total as fast as possible, cards like Price of Progress and Grim Lavamancer help to maximize damage output while maintaining pressure on the opponent. Additionally, the deck incorporates disruptive cards like Blood Moon and Tin Street Hooligan to disrupt the opponent's game plan and seize advantages in the matchup."
