The deck focuses on a fast and explosive strategy, using cards like Breakthrough and Careful Study to accelerate the graveyard filling process. Additionally, the deck includes disruption elements like Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's game plan while advancing its own strategy. The inclusion of key creatures like Ichorid and Narcomoeba further enhance the deck's graveyard shenanigans."
