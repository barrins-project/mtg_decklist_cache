It also disrupts opponents' mana bases with Magus of the Moon and uses burn spells like Tarfire and Incinerate to control the board. The deck has a mix of creatures, removal, and mana acceleration to overwhelm opponents quickly. Additionally, cards like Garruk Wildspeaker and Loxodon Warhammer provide additional utility and pressure in longer games."
