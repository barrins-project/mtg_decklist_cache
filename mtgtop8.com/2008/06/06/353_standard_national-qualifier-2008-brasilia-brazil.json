The deck also utilizes cards like Reveillark and Body Double for value plays and recursion. With the ability to generate mana with cards like Coldsteel Heart and Mind Stone, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and win the game through incremental advantage and smart decision-making. The inclusion of Faerie Conclave and Mutavault provides additional creature threats and flexibility in combat."
