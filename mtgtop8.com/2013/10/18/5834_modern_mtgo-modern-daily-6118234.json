The deck also includes cards like Lightning Bolt and Firespout for additional removal and disruption, as well as card selection cards like Peer Through Depths and Izzet Charm. The deck aims to control the board early on and then win the game quickly and decisively once the combo is assembled."

The inclusion of Sylvan Scrying, Ancient Stirrings, and Chromatic artifacts helps to ensure consistent mana production and card advantage.
