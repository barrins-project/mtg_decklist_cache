By combining powerful cards like Thassa, God of the Sea and Master of Waves with control elements like Detention Sphere and Supreme Verdict, the deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent while maintaining a strong board presence. Utilizing cards like Bident of Thassa and Elspeth, Sun's Champion for additional card draw and removal, the deck seeks to quickly close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
