The deck features a mix of removal spells, counterspells, and board wipes to maintain control of the game. By utilizing cards like Saruli Gatekeepers and Warleader's Helix to gain life and remove threats, along with cards like Urban Evolution for card advantage, the deck aims to stall the game until it can win with Maze's End. This deck's strategy revolves around controlling the game through a combination of gate synergy and strategic spell usage."
