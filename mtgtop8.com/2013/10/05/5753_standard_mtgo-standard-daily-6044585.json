The deck focuses on efficient creatures such as Burning-Tree Emissary and Voice of Resurgence, supported by removal spells like Lightning Strike and Boros Reckoner. The mana base is optimized for consistent casting of spells and creatures within the Gruul color identity, with a splash of white for additional creature support. This deck aims to pressure the opponent early and maintain aggression throughout the game."
