By utilizing creatures with strong abilities like tap-down and card advantage, along with the powerful Thassa, God of the Sea, the deck aims to control the board while steadily building up a strong offense. Cards like Master of Waves and Nightveil Specter help provide additional threats and card advantage, while tools like Cyclonic Rift and Jace, Architect of Thought offer flexibility and disruption. Mutavault and Bident of Thassa provide additional synergy and ways to close out games quickly."

It utilizes a mix of creatures and spells to maintain a consistent and potent offense."
