Purphoros, God of the Forge acts as a finisher, dealing damage to opponents whenever creatures enter the battlefield. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Domri Rade and Xenagos, the Reveler to help control the board and generate additional resources. Overall, this deck is focused on aggressive play and overwhelming opponents with red devotion creatures and burn spells."
