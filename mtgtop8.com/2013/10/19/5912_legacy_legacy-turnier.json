The deck aims to apply pressure with its aggressive creatures, while also having access to versatile removal spells like Lightning Bolt, Abrupt Decay, and Punishing Fire. The deck also has a strong grind game with cards like Liliana of the Veil and Sensei's Divining Top to generate card advantage and control the board."
