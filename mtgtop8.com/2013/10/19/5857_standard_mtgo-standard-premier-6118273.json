The synergy between cards like Soldier of the Pantheon, Banisher Priest, and Precinct Captain allows for efficient board control and constant pressure on the opponent. Additionally, cards like Spear of Heliod and Ajani, Caller of the Pride provide additional boosts to the creatures, making them even more threatening. The deck aims to quickly establish a dominant board presence and close out the game before the opponent can recover."
