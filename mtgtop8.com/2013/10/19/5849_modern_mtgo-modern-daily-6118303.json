            "notes": "This deck focuses on using faeries to control the game by countering opponent's spells, stealing their creatures, and disrupting their strategy. It also utilizes burn spells like Lightning Bolt for additional removal. The faeries, especially Vendilion Clique and Mistbind Clique, provide flying threats that can quickly close out the game. Engineered Explosives and Tectonic Edge are included for additional removal and disruption. The deck aims to maintain control of the game while slowly wearing down the opponent's resources and ultimately winning through efficient and strategic play."
