Thassa, God of the Sea provides card advantage and helps with scrying, while Master of Waves generates a large number of Elemental tokens. Judge's Familiar helps control the battlefield early on, and the deck utilizes counterspells like Syncopate to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The presence of Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx allows for explosive mana generation to play multiple threats in a single turn."
