Additionally, cards like Nightveil Specter and Master of Waves provide additional threats and ways to generate value. The deck also includes disruption through counterspells like Judge's Familiar and bounce spells like Cyclonic Rift to control the opponent's board."

Chained to the Rocks provides removal for larger threats, while Chandra, Pyromaster and Chandra's Phoenix provide card advantage and recurring damage. The deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The deck also includes efficient removal with cards like Scavenging Ooze and burn spells to control the board. The high number of mana accelerants and big creatures make it a strong ramp/control deck that aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."

With a mana base consisting entirely of Islands, the deck maintains consistency and ensures smooth gameplay."
