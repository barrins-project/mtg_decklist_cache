It also utilizes various board control cards (Oblivion Stone, Pyroclasm) and graveyard hate cards (Relic of Progenitus) to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents by playing threats like Wurmcoil Engine and potentially game-ending finishers like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on using artifacts efficiently to overwhelm opponents with a fast and aggressive strategy. By leveraging cards like Cranial Plating and Steel Overseer to boost the power of creatures, players can quickly deal damage and maintain board presence. The deck also utilizes cards like Arcbound Ravager and Master of Etherium to further enhance the synergy between artifacts and creatures. This aggressive Affinity archetype aims to exploit the early game advantage of playing multiple artifacts quickly, putting pressure on opponents and claiming victory before they can stabilize."
