The deck also focuses on controlling the board with cards like Cyclonic Rift and Disperse, while using the Scry ability of cards like Omenspeaker to maintain card advantage and ensure smooth draws. The inclusion of Jace, Architect of Thought and Bident of Thassa helps to further enhance the deck's control and card advantage capabilities."

The inclusion of planeswalkers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Jace, Architect of Thought provide additional value and card advantage. The deck is designed to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a long, grindy game."
