Once you have a large amount of mana, you can play big threats like Polukranos, World Eater and Arbor Colossus to control the board. Nylea, God of the Hunt and Garruk, Caller of Beasts provide additional card advantage and support for your big creatures. Domri Rade and Xenagos, the Reveler can help you dig through your deck and generate even more mana to overwhelm your opponent."
