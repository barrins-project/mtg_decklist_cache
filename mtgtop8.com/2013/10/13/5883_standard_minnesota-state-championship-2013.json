The deck focuses on quickly building a strong board presence through cards like Experiment One, Fleecemane Lion, and Voice of Resurgence. Boon Satyr can provide additional power and flexibility. Ajani, Caller of the Pride can further enhance the creatures and provide extra damage. The deck also includes ways to protect its creatures with Rootborn Defenses and Selesnya Charm. Overall, the goal is to apply pressure early and maintain board control to secure a quick victory."
