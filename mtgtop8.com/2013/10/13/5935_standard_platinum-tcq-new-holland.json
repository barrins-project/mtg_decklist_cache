The inclusion of powerful threats like Obzedat, Ghost Council and Blood Baron of Vizkopa provide a win condition, while cards like Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, this deck aims to dominate the game through control and resource management."

The removal spells like Doom Blade and Hero's Downfall help clear the way for your creatures to attack, while cards like Whip of Erebos provide additional staying power. The deck aims to establish a strong board presence and apply pressure early on to win the game quickly."
