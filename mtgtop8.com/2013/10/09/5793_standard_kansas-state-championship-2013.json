By using cards like Dissolve, Hero's Downfall, and Detention Sphere, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up its own win conditions. The deck also includes card draw and life gain through cards like Sphinx's Revelation to help maintain resources and outvalue the opponent in the long game. Ultimately, the deck seeks to stall the game until it can establish a dominant board presence and close out the game with powerful finishers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Aetherling."

            "notes": "The main concept of this Esper Control deck is to utilize a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to control the board and outvalue the opponent. By efficiently managing threats with cards like Supreme Verdict and Hero's Downfall, while also generating card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation and Jace, Architect of Thought, the deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a dominant position and win through powerful finishers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion or Aetherling. The inclusion of versatile cards like Detention Sphere and Azorius Charm further adds to the deck's flexibility and control capabilities."
