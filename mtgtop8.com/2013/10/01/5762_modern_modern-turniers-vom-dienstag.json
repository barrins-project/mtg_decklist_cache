It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while gaining card advantage through cards like Cryptic Command and Sphinx's Revelation. The deck also includes versatile threats like Celestial Colonnade and planeswalkers like Ajani Vengeant and Gideon Jura to close out the game. The mana base is carefully crafted to ensure consistent mana fixing and to support the deck's strategy of controlling the game and outvaluing the opponent."
