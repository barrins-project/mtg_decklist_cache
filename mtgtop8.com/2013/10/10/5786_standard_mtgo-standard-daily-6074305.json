Chandra's Phoenix provides recurring damage while Burning-Tree Emissary and Boros Reckoner help maintain board presence. Ash Zealot hinders opposing graveyard strategies. Mutavault can also be used as a creature to further the aggressive game plan. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with rapid damage output."
