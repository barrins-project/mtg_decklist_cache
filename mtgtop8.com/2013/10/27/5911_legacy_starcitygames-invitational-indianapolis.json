With a mix of hand disruption, card draw, and powerful planeswalkers, the deck aims to control the game in the early turns before transitioning into a midrange strategy with threats like Tarmogoyf and Shardless Agent. The mana base is designed to support the deck's triple-color requirements, with a mix of fetch lands and dual lands. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and win through incremental advantage."
