By utilizing these cards along with other control elements like countermagic (Remand, Cryptic Command) and card selection (Serum Visions, Peek), the deck aims to create infinite copies of Pestermite/Deceiver Exarch using Splinter Twin and Kiki-Jiki, which can then be used to attack for lethal damage. The deck also includes disruption (Lightning Bolt, Vendilion Clique) and card advantage (Snapcaster Mage, Izzet Charm) to support the combo and control the game."
