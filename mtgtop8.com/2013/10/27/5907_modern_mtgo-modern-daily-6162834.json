The inclusion of Squadron Hawk and Ranger of Eos helps with card advantage and consistency. The deck also includes removal in the form of Path to Exile and disruption in Aven Mindcensor. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast, life-gaining aggro deck."

By utilizing cards like Birthing Pod and Chord of Calling to search for specific creatures, the deck can assemble powerful combinations like infinite life gain or infinite damage. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Abrupt Decay and Voice of Resurgence to control the board and protect the combo pieces. With a mix of value creatures and combo pieces, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its synergies and versatility."
