It also disrupts the opponent's hand with Thoughtseize and controls the board with Desecration Demon. The deck can finish off the opponent with powerful threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Rakdos's Return. Chandra, Pyromaster provides a repeatable source of card advantage and removal. Overall, this deck aims to keep the opponent's board clear while slowly building its own advantage until it can overwhelm the opponent with its threats."
