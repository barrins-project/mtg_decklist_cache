By utilizing powerful red devotion creatures like Stormbreath Dragon, Fanatic of Mogis, and Purphoros, God of the Forge, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with damage. Domri Rade and Xenagos, the Reveler provide additional utility and card advantage while Hammer of Purphoros allows for extra creature tokens to be created. The key idea is to establish a strong board presence and win the game through fast and efficient damage output."

It aims to put pressure on the opponent early with efficient creatures like Soldier of the Pantheon and Precinct Captain, while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Sin Collector. The deck's top end includes powerful threats like Desecration Demon and Obzedat, Ghost Council, backed up by removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Doom Blade. Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Whip of Erebos provide additional ways to close out the game or gain an advantage."
