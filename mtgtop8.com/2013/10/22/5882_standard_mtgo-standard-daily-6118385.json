            "notes": "The main strategy of this deck is to ramp up your mana quickly using green ramp cards like Voyaging Satyr, Sylvan Caryatid, and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx in order to play high-costed threats such as Polukranos, World Eater and Arbor Colossus. Once you have established a strong mana base, you can use powerful planeswalkers like Garruk, Caller of Beasts and Domri Rade to draw more threats and maintain control of the board. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with large creatures and efficient removal spells while maintaining a strong mana advantage."
