By playing cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Nightveil Specter, the deck can quickly drain the opponent's life total and gain advantage from their own permanents. With removal spells like Doom Blade and Hero's Downfall, the deck can also control the board while generating card advantage with Underworld Connections. The deck also has some resilience and card advantage engines in Whip of Erebos and Liliana of the Dark Realms."
