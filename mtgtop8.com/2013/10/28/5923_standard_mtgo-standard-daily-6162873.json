The deck uses counterspells like Judge's Familiar and Tidebinder Mage to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also utilizing card advantage from cards like Thassa, God of the Sea and Bident of Thassa. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of evasive creatures and powerful finishers like Cyclonic Rift and Jace, Architect of Thought. The inclusion of Mutavault provides additional flexibility and synergy with the deck's creature base."
