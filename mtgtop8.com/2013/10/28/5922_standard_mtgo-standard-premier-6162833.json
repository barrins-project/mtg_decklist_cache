The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of fast creatures like Burning-Tree Emissary and Ash Zealot, while also providing some removal with cards like Chained to the Rocks and Mizzium Mortars. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Stormbreath Dragon and versatile planeswalkers like Chandra, Pyromaster adds additional threats to the deck's aggressive strategy. The deck is designed to quickly build up a strong board presence and apply pressure to the opponent."
