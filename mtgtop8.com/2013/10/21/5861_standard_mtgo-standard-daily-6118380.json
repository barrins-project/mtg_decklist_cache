By using cards like Pack Rat and Gray Merchant of Asphodel, you can quickly generate a substantial board presence and drain your opponent's life total. Additionally, removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Doom Blade help to control the opponent's threats, while Thoughtseize and Lifebane Zombie disrupt their game plan. With a mix of card advantage from Underworld Connections and the resilience of Desecration Demon, this deck aims to take control of the game and secure a victory."
