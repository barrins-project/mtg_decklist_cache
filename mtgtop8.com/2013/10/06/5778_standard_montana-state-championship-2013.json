By playing powerful threats like Voice of Resurgence, Boros Reckoner, Loxodon Smiter, and Stormbreath Dragon, the deck aims to deal damage and put pressure on the opponent from the early turns of the game. The inclusion of Domri Rade helps to boost the consistency and power of the creatures, while cards like Selesnya Charm and Ghor-Clan Rampager provide additional utility and combat tricks to ensure victory in aggressive matchups."

It aims to maintain board control by constantly removing threats with cards like Ultimate Price, Doom Blade, and Merciless Eviction. Additionally, Thoughtseize and Read the Bones help disrupt the opponent's plans while providing card advantage. The creatures in the deck, such as Desecration Demon and Obzedat, Ghost Council, are difficult to deal with and can quickly close out the game. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through a combination of control elements and powerful threats."
