By using cards like Rakdos's Return, Dreadbore, and Anger of the Gods, you can keep your opponent's threats in check while building up your own board presence with cards like Stormbreath Dragon and Desecration Demon. This deck aims to control the game until you can overwhelm your opponent with powerful threats and secure your victory."
