Using efficient and resilient creatures like Precinct Captain, Banisher Priest, and Soldier of the Pantheon, alongside anthem effects like Spear of Heliod and Brave the Elements, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence. The inclusion of removal and protection spells like Boros Charm and Judge's Familiar helps to maintain pressure and protect the board. Mutavault provides additional creature threats, while the manabase ensures consistent access to white mana."

The deck also features card advantage engines like Sphinx's Revelation and Jace, Architect of Thought to keep up with the opponent in the late game. Overall, the deck aims to stall the game, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and eventually win through incremental advantage and superior late-game threats."
