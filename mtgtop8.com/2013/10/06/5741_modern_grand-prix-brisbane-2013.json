It focuses on the synergy between artifacts and the Affinity mechanic, allowing for explosive starts and maximization of resources. The deck quickly deploys threats like Steel Overseer, Signal Pest, and Arcbound Ravager, while also having removal in the form of Galvanic Blast. It aims to win by equipping Cranial Plating onto creatures, creating massive swings of damage. The deck also has a mana base that leverages lands that can become creatures and non-basic lands to enable casting multiple spells each turn."

Additionally, the deck focuses on generating card advantage and maintaining a strong board presence through cards like Lingering Souls, Dark Confidant, and Phyrexian Arena. The deck also includes answers to problematic creatures and threats with removal spells like Go for the Throat and Abrupt Decay. The land base is designed to provide consistent access to the colors needed for the deck's spells."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's hand with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize while putting pressure on the board with powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant. The deck also has a strong mana base with lands that can produce multiple colors of mana to cast its spells. By combining disruption with aggressive threats, the deck aims to control the game and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
