Liliana of the Dark Realms and Erebos, God of the Dead provide additional value and control options, while cards like Hero's Downfall and Doom Blade deal with opposing threats. Thoughtseize helps disrupt opponents' strategies, and Underworld Connections provides card advantage. Mutavault and Whip of Erebos round out the deck with additional versatility and recursion options."

By utilizing the devotion mechanic and mana acceleration from Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx, the deck is able to consistently play threats on curve and apply pressure from multiple angles. Thassa, God of the Sea acts as a powerful engine for card selection and unblockable damage, while Cyclonic Rift provides a blowout potential against opposing board states. The deck aims to maintain tempo and control the game early on, eventually overwhelming the opponent with a flood of creatures."
