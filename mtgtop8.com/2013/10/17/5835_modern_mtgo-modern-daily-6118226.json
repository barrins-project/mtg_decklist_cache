The creatures in the deck are efficient beaters that can quickly close out the game, while the planeswalkers provide additional value and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent and keep them on the back foot throughout the game."

The goal is to use Scapeshift to sacrifice lands and search for multiple Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle, which will trigger when mountains enter the battlefield and deal damage to the opponent. Control elements like Remand and Pyroclasm help to disrupt the opponent's strategy while cards like Prismatic Omen ensure all lands count as mountains. The deck aims to win by overwhelming the opponent with powerful land triggers."
