By using cards like Mox Opal, Springleaf Drum, and Thoughtcast, the deck can play multiple threats in the early turns and finish off the opponent with powerful pump spells like Cranial Plating and Galvanic Blast. The key is to establish a board presence quickly and efficiently, using evasive creatures like Vault Skirge and Signal Pest to deal damage before the opponent can stabilize."
