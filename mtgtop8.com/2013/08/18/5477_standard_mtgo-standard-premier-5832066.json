The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by using Lifebane Zombie and Desecration Demon to strip away key creatures. Thragtusk provides resilience and lifegain, while Scavenging Ooze can be used to exile cards from graveyards. The deck's win condition is to gradually wear down the opponent with powerful threats like Desecration Demon and Vraska the Unseen."
