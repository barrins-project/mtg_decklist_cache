By using a mix of cheap, efficient creatures like Stromkirk Noble and Rakdos Cackler alongside powerful finishers like Hellrider, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently to end the game before the opponent can stabilize. Mutavault provides additional versatility and resilience, allowing the deck to continue applying pressure even in the face of removal spells. Overall, this deck focuses on speed and aggression to secure victory."
