The goal is to establish a strong board presence with resilient threats like Thragtusk and Desecration Demon, while using cards like Liliana of the Veil and Mutilate to keep the opponent's resources in check. The combination of removal, card advantage, and powerful threats make it difficult for the opponent to establish their own game plan, ultimately leading to a victory through attrition and resource management."
