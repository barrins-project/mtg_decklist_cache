By ramping mana with Farseek and utilizing cards like Thragtusk, Scavenging Ooze, Olivia Voldaren, and Huntmaster of the Fells, the deck aims to maintain board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a mix of versatile removal and resilient threats, the deck can adapt to different matchups and grind out victories through attrition. The inclusion of powerful planeswalker Garruk, Primal Hunter and finishers like Rakdos's Return provide additional late-game options for seizing control of the game."
