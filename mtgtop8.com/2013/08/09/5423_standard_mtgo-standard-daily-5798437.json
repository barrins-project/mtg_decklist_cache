It also includes control elements such as Syncopate and Dissipate to counter spells and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Card draw and selection with Think Twice and Azorius Charm help to maintain card advantage and find key pieces. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the three-color combination of Jeskai, allowing for consistent casting of spells across all three colors. The deck aims to close out games quickly while maintaining some flexibility for dealing with opposing threats."
