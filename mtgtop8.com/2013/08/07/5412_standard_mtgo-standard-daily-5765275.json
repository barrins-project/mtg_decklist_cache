            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to utilize a combination of removal spells, hand disruption, and powerful creatures to control the game and out value the opponent. By using cards like Tragic Slip, Putrefy, and Mizzium Mortars to remove threats, along with cards like Rakdos's Return and Lifebane Zombie to disrupt the opponent's hand, this deck aims to create a favorable position on the board. With powerful threats like Huntmaster of the Fells, Olivia Voldaren, and Thragtusk to apply pressure, the deck looks to maintain control until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful creatures."
