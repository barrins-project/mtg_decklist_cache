The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan through cards like Ghor-Clan Rampager and Mizzium Mortars. Domri Rade provides additional creature removal and card advantage, while Kessig Wolf Run can be used to finish off opponents with large, trampling creatures. Overall, the deck focuses on speed, power, and disruption to secure a swift victory."
