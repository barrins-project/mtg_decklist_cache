The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements while maintaining consistency. The objective is to outlast the opponent and ultimately secure victory by overwhelming them with superior resources."

The deck includes a mix of counterspells, burn spells, card draw, and powerful planeswalkers like Gideon Jura to establish control over the battlefield. Additionally, the deck utilizes powerful lands like Celestial Colonnade and Tectonic Edge to maintain board presence and outvalue the opponent in a longer game. The goal is to outlast the opponent and win through incremental advantage and efficient removal."
