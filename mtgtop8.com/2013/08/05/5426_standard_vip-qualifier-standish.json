The deck also benefits from ramping up mana with cards like Arbor Elf and Ghor-Clan Rampager to play powerful threats like Thundermaw Hellkite. Domri Rade serves as card advantage and creature buffing, enhancing the deck's overall aggressive strategy. With a mix of strong creatures and removal, the deck aims to quickly close out games before the opponent can stabilize."

The creatures in the deck, such as Boros Reckoner and Thundermaw Hellkite, also contribute to this aggressive strategy by dealing damage directly to the opponent. The inclusion of Burning Earth punishes opponents for playing nonbasic lands, giving this deck an additional edge. Mutavault provides additional creatures and Mountain provides the mana needed to cast the powerful spells and creatures in this aggressive deck."
