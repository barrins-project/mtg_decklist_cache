By casting a series of cheap cantrips and rituals, the deck aims to build up enough mana and spells in the graveyard to eventually cast a lethal Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens to finish off the opponent in one explosive turn. The deck relies on careful sequencing and manipulation of the graveyard to win the game efficiently."
