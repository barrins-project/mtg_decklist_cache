By utilizing aggressive creatures like Champion of the Parish, Mayor of Avabruck, and Silverblade Paladin, this deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Cards like Ghor-Clan Rampager and Searing Spear provide additional reach and removal options to push for a quick victory. The deck is designed to overwhelm opponents with a fast and powerful aggro strategy centered around Naya Human creatures."
