The deck also includes ways to disrupt your opponent's strategy with cards like Surgical Extraction and Crypt Incursion. By consistently milling your opponent's cards, you can potentially win the game by running them out of cards before they can defeat you. The deck focuses on controlling the game and manipulating your opponent's deck to your advantage."
