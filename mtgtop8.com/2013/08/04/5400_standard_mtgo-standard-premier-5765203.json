By combining cards like Falkenrath Aristocrat, Xathrid Necromancer, and Cartel Aristocrat with sacrifice outlets like Blood Artist and Tragic Slip, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of creature aggression and life drain effects. Lingering Souls and Gather the Townsfolk provide additional token generation for added value and Zealous Conscripts can be used to steal opposing threats or push through for lethal damage."
