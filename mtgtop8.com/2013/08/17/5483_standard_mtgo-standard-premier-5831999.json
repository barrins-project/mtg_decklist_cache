These creatures are supported by burn spells like Pillar of Flame, Searing Spear, and Brimstone Volley to control the board and finish off opponents. Hellrider provides additional damage output, while Chandra's Phoenix offers recurring damage. The deck also includes Burning Earth to punish opponents for playing non-basic lands. Mutavault can become a creature to take advantage of anthem effects and pump up the aggression."

By using cards like Liliana of the Veil, Mutilate, and Desecration Demon, the deck aims to clear the board and disrupt the opponent's plans. Thragtusk, Scavenging Ooze, and Lifebane Zombie provide resilience and value while applying pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes some card draw and life gain to help maintain resources. Ultimately, the goal is to grind out a victory through attrition and resource management."
