The deck also includes powerful spells like Supreme Verdict and Sphinx's Revelation to keep the board clear and gain card advantage. Warleader's Helix and other burn spells provide additional reach to finish off opponents. Tamiyo, the Moon Sage can be used for card draw and control, while Azorius Charm and other cards offer additional flexibility and utility."
