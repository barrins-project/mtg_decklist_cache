By utilizing cards like Delver of Secrets, Nimble Mongoose, and Tarmogoyf, the deck aims to establish a fast clock and control the game tempo. Supporting these threats are soft permission spells like Spell Pierce and Spell Snare, along with hard counters like Force of Will. Additionally, the inclusion of disruptive cards like Stifle and Wasteland helps to further disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining constant pressure."
