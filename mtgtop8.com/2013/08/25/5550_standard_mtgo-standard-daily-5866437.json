Additionally, the inclusion of burn spells provides additional reach and the ability to finish off opponents who may stabilize against the creature threats."

The deck also has creatures like Restoration Angel and Snapcaster Mage to provide additional value and win conditions like Aetherling. The mana base is designed to support the control spells and creatures' color requirements efficiently."
