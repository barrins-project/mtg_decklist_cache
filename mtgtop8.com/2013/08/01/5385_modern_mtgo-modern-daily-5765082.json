The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Ajani Vengeant to control the board and provide additional threats. The inclusion of Lingering Souls provides additional value and resilience against removal spells. Overall, the deck aims to establish an early board presence and maintain pressure throughout the game to overwhelm the opponent."

Pyromancer Ascension is used to copy spells, allowing for explosive turns where multiple copies of spell are cast. Past in Flames is used to recur spells from the graveyard, while Grapeshot is the finisher that deals damage equal to the number of spells cast in a turn. The deck is focused on casting a high volume of spells in a single turn to overwhelm the opponent."
