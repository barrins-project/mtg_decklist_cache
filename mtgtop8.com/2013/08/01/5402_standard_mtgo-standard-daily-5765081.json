Cards like Essence Scatter, Dissipate, and Detention Sphere help control the opponent's threats, while Sphinx's Revelation and Think Twice provide card draw and life gain. Supreme Verdict acts as a board wipe, while Aetherling serves as a win condition. Restoration Angel and Snapcaster Mage provide value by reusing spells, and Augur of Bolas helps filter through the deck. The mana base is designed to support the deck's control elements with a balance of Plains and Islands."
