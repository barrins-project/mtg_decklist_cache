The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a swarm of elves and finish them off with a massive attack from Craterhoof Behemoth. The key strategy is to efficiently ramp up mana production and combo off for a lethal blow."

The deck aims to control the opponent's board while applying pressure with efficient threats, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with card advantage and tempo. The mana base is carefully crafted to support both the aggressive and controlling aspects of the deck, allowing for smooth gameplay and consistency in its strategy."
