The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of efficient creatures and disruptive spells while utilizing the Orzhov colors for additional synergy and flexibility. With a solid mana base and a mixture of threats and answers, this deck looks to apply consistent pressure and close out games quickly."

The deck includes cards that provide protection and evasion for key creatures, as well as removal options to deal with opposing threats. The goal is to establish a board presence early and maintain pressure throughout the game, ultimately closing out the match with efficient attacks and powerful abilities. The mana base is optimized for consistent access to both colored and colorless sources, enabling a smooth curve of threats and answers."
