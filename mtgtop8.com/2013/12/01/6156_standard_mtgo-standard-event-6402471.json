Utilizing cards like Thassa, God of the Sea and Master of Waves, you can quickly build a board presence and control the game. By utilizing cards like Judge's Familiar and Tidebinder Mage for disruption, this deck aims to control the tempo of the game and come out on top with a powerful assault of creatures. The inclusion of Jace, Architect of Thought provides additional card advantage and protection for your creatures."
