It includes cards that enhance the board presence of white weenie creatures, such as Precinct Captain and Soldier of the Pantheon, as well as cards that provide protection and buffs, like Boros Charm and Brave the Elements. The deck also includes some control elements with cards like Banisher Priest and Imposing Sovereign to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the key strategy is to quickly build a wide board presence and apply pressure to the opponent."

By ramping up mana, the deck can play powerful threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Fanatic of Mogis to quickly overwhelm the opponent. Chained to the Rocks and Mizzium Mortars provide removal options, while Chandra, Pyromaster offers card advantage and burn damage. The inclusion of Hammer of Purphoros allows for additional threats to be created, making it difficult for opponents to keep up with the aggressive gameplay."
