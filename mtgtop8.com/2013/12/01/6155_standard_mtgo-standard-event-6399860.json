By utilizing cards that increase black devotion, such as Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Erebos, God of the Dead, the deck aims to generate a substantial amount of mana through Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and dominate the board with creatures like Desecration Demon and Nightveil Specter. With a mix of removal spells like Ultimate Price and Hero's Downfall, as well as disruption with cards like Thoughtseize, the deck aims to control the game while pressuring the opponent with a steady stream of threats."
