By curving out with efficient threats like Pack Rat, Nightveil Specter, Desecration Demon, and Gray Merchant of Asphodel, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall. The mana base is designed to support the heavy black mana requirements of the deck, allowing for consistent plays and powerful synergies between the cards."
