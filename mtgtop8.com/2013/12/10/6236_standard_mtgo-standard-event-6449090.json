The deck also utilizes graveyard recursion with cards like Grisly Salvage and Wildwood Rebirth. Nylea, God of the Hunt provides trample to help push through damage, while Deathrite Shaman provides additional utility. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and efficient creatures, keeping the pressure on throughout the game."
