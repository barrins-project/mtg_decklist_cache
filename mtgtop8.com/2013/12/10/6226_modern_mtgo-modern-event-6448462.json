This aggressive strategy is supported by Squadron Hawk, Spectral Procession, and Serra Ascendant to put pressure on the opponent. Brave the Elements and Honor of the Pure provide additional support for the aggro strategy, while Path to Exile helps remove any threats from the opponent's side of the board. Ranger of Eos provides card advantage and Windbrisk Heights offers some additional utility."
