By utilizing cards like Desecration Demon, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, and Pack Rat, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats while also disrupting their game plan with removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Hero's Downfall. Thoughtseize assists in disrupting the opponent's hand, while cards like Underworld Connections provide card advantage to keep the pressure on the opponent."
