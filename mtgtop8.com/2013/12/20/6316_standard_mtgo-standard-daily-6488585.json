            "notes": "This deck focuses on overwhelming the opponent with aggressive creatures and spells that require a heavy black mana devotion. By utilizing cards like Desecration Demon, Pack Rat, and Gray Merchant of Asphodel, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall help to control the opponent's hand and board, while cards like Mutavault and Temple of Deceit provide additional utility and mana fixing. With a strong emphasis on black mana symbols in its cards, this deck maximizes its potential by fully committing to the color black."
