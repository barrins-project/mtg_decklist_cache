The win condition is to gain card advantage and stabilize the board with cards like Sphinx's Revelation and Supreme Verdict while using powerful planeswalkers like Jace, Architect of Thought and Elspeth, Sun's Champion to close out the game. The deck also includes some utility cards like Azorius Charm and Celestial Flare to deal with specific threats, making it a versatile control deck well-suited for a wide range of matchups."
