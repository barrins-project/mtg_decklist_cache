By utilizing cards like Nightveil Specter, Master of Waves, and Thassa, God of the Sea, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly while also providing some card advantage and tempo with cards like Judge's Familiar, Cyclonic Rift, and Jace, Architect of Thought. The inclusion of cards like Mutavault and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx adds versatility and additional power to the deck's aggressive game plan."
