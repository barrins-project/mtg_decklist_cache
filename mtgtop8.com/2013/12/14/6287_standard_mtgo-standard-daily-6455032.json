Thoughtseize is used to strip away key cards from the opponent's hand, while Vraska the Unseen provides additional removal and threat. The creatures in the deck, such as Desecration Demon and Polukranos, World Eater, are powerful threats that can quickly close out the game. Additionally, Pack Rat and Scavenging Ooze provide value and flexibility in different matchups. This Golgari Control deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents through a combination of removal, threats, and card advantage."
