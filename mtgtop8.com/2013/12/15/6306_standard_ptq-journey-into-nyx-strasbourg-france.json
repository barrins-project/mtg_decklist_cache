It includes aggressive creatures like Boros Elite and Daring Skyjek, along with cards like Brave the Elements to protect your creatures from removal spells. The key strategy is to maintain a fast pace of aggression while using cards like Banisher Priest and Imposing Sovereign to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the inclusion of Xathrid Necromancer provides resilience against board wipes, giving the deck staying power in longer games."
