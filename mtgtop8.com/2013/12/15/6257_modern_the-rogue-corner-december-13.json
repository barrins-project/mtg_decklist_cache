Cards like Soul's Attendant, Soul Warden, and Champion of the Parish help to fuel Ajani's Pridemate and Purphoros, God of the Forge, while Norin the Wary triggers these effects repeatedly. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of creatures and burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile to maintain control of the board and push for a quick victory."
