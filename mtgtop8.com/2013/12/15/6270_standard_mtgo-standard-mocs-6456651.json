By using cards like Pack Rat, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, and Desecration Demon, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a high-powered black mana base. Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall help control the board while Underworld Connections provides card advantage. The inclusion of Mutavault and Temple of Silence adds flexibility and consistency to the mana base, allowing for a smooth and efficient aggressive playstyle."
