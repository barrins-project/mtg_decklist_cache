The deck also includes removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Ultimate Price to deal with threats, along with card draw from Underworld Connections to maintain resources. Overall, it is a fast-paced and disruptive deck that aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly."

The creatures are low cost and have haste abilities, allowing them to attack right away. Burn spells are used to remove blockers or deal direct damage to the opponent. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of quick creature damage and burn spells, finishing them off before they have a chance to stabilize their board."
