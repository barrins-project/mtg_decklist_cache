The deck also incorporates powerful black removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Thoughtseize to control the battlefield. Erebos, God of the Dead provides card draw and lifegain, while the Temple of Deceit and Mutavault offer additional utility. Overall, the strategy focuses on building a strong board presence and disrupting the opponent's game plan efficiently."
