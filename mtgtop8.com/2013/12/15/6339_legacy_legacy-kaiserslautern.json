            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to quickly establish board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan through a combination of efficient creatures and disruptive spells. The deck aims to apply pressure early on with aggressive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Nimble Mongoose, while also utilizing cards like Force of Will and Daze to counter key threats from the opponent. The mana base is designed to provide access to a variety of colors for versatility, while also including land destruction with cards like Wasteland to further disrupt the opponent's strategy."
