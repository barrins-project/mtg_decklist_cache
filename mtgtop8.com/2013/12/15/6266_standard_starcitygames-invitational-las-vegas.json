It aims to stall the game while drawing cards and gaining life until it can finish off the opponent with powerful threats like Jace, Architect of Thought and Aetherling. The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan, maintain card advantage, and stabilize the battlefield before closing out the game with a strong finisher. The mana base is designed to ensure consistency and support the deck's control elements."
