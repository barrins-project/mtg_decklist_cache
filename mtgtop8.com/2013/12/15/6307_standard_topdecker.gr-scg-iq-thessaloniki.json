Frostburn Weird, Tidebinder Mage, and Nightveil Specter provide disruption while Mutavault and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx help generate mana. The inclusion of Rapid Hybridization and Cyclonic Rift offers removal options, while Bident of Thassa and Jace, Architect of Thought provide card advantage. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its aggression and efficient card synergies."
