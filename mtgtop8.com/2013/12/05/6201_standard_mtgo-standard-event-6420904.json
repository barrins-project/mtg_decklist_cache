By utilizing counterspells, removal spells, and card draw, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and eventually win with powerful late-game threats like Aetherling, Blood Baron of Vizkopa, or Elspeth, Sun's Champion. The combination of Sphinx's Revelation for card advantage and lifegain, along with powerful board wipes like Supreme Verdict, allows the deck to survive against aggro decks while setting up for a strong late-game win condition."
