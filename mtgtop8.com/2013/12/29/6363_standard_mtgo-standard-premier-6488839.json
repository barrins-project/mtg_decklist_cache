Control elements like Detention Sphere and removal spells like Doom Blade and Supreme Verdict help maintain board presence and clear the way for continuous assaults. Finally, the inclusion of powerful finishers like Obzedat, Ghost Council and Desecration Demon provide additional threats to close out the game."
