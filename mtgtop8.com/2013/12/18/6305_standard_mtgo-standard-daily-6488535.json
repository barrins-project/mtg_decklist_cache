By generating a high amount of black mana symbols on the battlefield, cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel becomes a potent finisher, draining the opponent's life total. The deck also includes disruptive cards like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall to control the opponent's resources, while creatures like Pack Rat and Desecration Demon apply pressure on the board. Additionally, the inclusion of Mutavault provides additional creature threats and Underworld Connections helps with card advantage."
