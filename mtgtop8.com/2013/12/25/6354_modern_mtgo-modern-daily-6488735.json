The deck also aims to disrupt opponents' mana bases with cards like Spreading Seas and Tectonic Edge, while also utilizing Aether Vial to cheat out creatures. Thassa, God of the Sea provides card selection and possible indestructibility, while Master of Waves generates a large board presence in the mid to late game. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast, evasive threats."

This control deck also includes cards like Relic of Progenitus and Pyroclasm to disrupt the opponent's strategy while controlling the board. The deck aims to stabilize the game early on with cards like Wurmcoil Engine and Oblivion Stone, and eventually overwhelm the opponent with large threats and powerful removal spells."
