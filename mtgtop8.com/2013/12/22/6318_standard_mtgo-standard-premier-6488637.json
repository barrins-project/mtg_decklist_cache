By playing efficient and powerful red cards like Burning-Tree Emissary, Boros Reckoner, and Ash Zealot, combined with powerful support cards like Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Purphoros, God of the Forge, this deck aims to quickly deal damage to your opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. With a mix of creatures, burn spells, and enchantments, this deck is focused on consistency and explosiveness."
