By resource denial and constant pressure, it seeks to control the game and force the opponent into unfavorable positions. The inclusion of cards like Trinisphere and Nether Void further slows down the opponent's game plan, making it difficult for them to recover and allowing the deck to maintain control until it can close out the game."
