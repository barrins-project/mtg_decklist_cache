Xathrid Necromancer provides additional value by creating zombie tokens, while the inclusion of Mutavault and Spear of Heliod offers additional power and versatility. The deck aims to maintain pressure and tempo to secure a swift victory."

The win condition comes from powerful finishers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Aetherling, ensuring that the control player can secure victory once they have established dominance on the battlefield."
