            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy through counterspells, removal spells, and board wipes. The deck aims to stall the game using cards like Supreme Verdict and Detention Sphere, while generating advantage and card draw through spells like Sphinx's Revelation and Jace, Architect of Thought. Finally, the deck can win the game by creating an overwhelming board presence with cards like Assemble the Legion and Elspeth, Sun's Champion. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and secure a victory through careful control of the game state."
