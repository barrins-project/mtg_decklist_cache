The deck includes powerful planeswalkers such as Jace, Architect of Thought and Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver to generate card advantage and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes sweepers like Supreme Verdict to clear the board and finishers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion to close out the game. The mana base is built to support the three-color control strategy with dual lands and scry lands for consistency."
