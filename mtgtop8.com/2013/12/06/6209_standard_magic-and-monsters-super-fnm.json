The deck has a mix of counterspells, removal spells, and planeswalkers to control the game and outvalue the opponent. It aims to stabilize the board with board wipes and key removal spells, then finish the game with a powerful threat like Aetherling. The deck's mana base is focused on providing consistent mana for its two-color spells."
