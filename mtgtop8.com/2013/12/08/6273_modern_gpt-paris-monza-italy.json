            "notes": "This deck focuses on using efficient removal spells and hand disruption to control the game early on, while also putting pressure on the opponent with powerful creatures like Dark Confidant and Scavenging Ooze. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also maintaining card advantage through cards like Phyrexian Arena and Lingering Souls. The mana base is designed to support a B/W/G color combination, allowing for flexible casting of spells from all three colors. The deck seeks to out value the opponent through a combination of disruption, card advantage, and aggressive creatures."
