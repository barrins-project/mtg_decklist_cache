Path to Exile is used for removal, and Spectral Procession provides additional creatures. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large life total and powerful creatures, leveraging the Martyr of Sands combo if needed. The deck also includes some support cards like Honor of the Pure and Chalice of Life to further enhance the aggro strategy."
