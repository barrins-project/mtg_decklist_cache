The deck aims to stabilize the battlefield with board wipes like Supreme Verdict and removal spells like Azorius Charm and Detention Sphere. Jace, Architect of Thought and Sphinx's Revelation provide card advantage and life gain to outvalue opponents. Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Aetherling serve as win conditions to close out the game once the player has gained control. The deck focuses on outlasting opponents and winning through attrition."
