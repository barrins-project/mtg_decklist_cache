By efficiently utilizing cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Ash Zealot to ramp into powerful threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Fanatic of Mogis, the deck can apply relentless pressure on the opponent. With support from cards like Purphoros, God of the Forge and Boros Reckoner, the deck aims to close out the game swiftly before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of removal spells like Mizzium Mortars helps keep the opponent's board in check while pushing through damage."
