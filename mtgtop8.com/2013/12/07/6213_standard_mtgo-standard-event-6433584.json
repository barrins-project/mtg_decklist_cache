By using cards like Shock, Lightning Strike, and Boros Charm, along with creatures like Rakdos Cackler and Firedrinker Satyr, the deck aims to apply pressure early in the game. Chained to the Rocks provides removal for opponent's creatures, while Boros Reckoner and Chandra's Phoenix offer additional threats. The deck also utilizes lands like Temple of Triumph and Sacred Foundry to ensure consistent mana production."
