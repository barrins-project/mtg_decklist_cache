The deck includes cards that allow for card advantage and disruption, as well as removal spells to deal with threats. The strategy is to control the board with efficient removal while applying pressure with creatures like Pack Rat and Gray Merchant of Asphodel. The goal is to deplete the opponent's resources and finish them off with a big swing of damage."
