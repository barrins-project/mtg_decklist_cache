By playing powerful creatures like Fleecemane Lion and Loxodon Smiter alongside versatile spells like Selesnya Charm and Advent of the Wurm, the deck aims to apply pressure from the early turns and maintain a strong board presence. Ajani, Caller of the Pride provides additional reach and synergy with the deck's creatures. The mana base is built to support the deck's aggressive game plan by ensuring consistent access to the right colors of mana."
