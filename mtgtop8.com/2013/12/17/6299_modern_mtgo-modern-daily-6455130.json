By utilizing cards that benefit from having artifacts in play, such as Cranial Plating and Steel Overseer, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. With a low mana curve and the ability to generate additional mana through cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, this deck can quickly deploy its threats and close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

It incorporates a combo element involving cards like Melira, Sylvok Outcast and Murderous Redcap to create infinite damage. The deck also utilizes cards like Chord of Calling and Eternal Witness to provide flexibility and recursion, while including disruptive creatures like Spellskite and Linvala, Keeper of Silence to control the board. The key concept is to assemble the right creatures at the right time to outvalue and overwhelm the opponent."
