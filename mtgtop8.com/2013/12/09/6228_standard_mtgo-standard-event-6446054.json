By using cards like Thoughtseize and Rakdos's Return to disrupt the opponent's hand and removal spells like Hero's Downfall, Abrupt Decay, and Anger of the Gods to deal with threats on the board, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent in the long game. Additionally, the deck includes powerful creatures like Polukranos, Reaper of the Wilds, Scavenging Ooze, and Stormbreath Dragon to close out the game once control has been established."
