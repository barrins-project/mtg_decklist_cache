The deck aims to quickly deal damage to the opponent using spells like Lightning Strike and Warleader's Helix, while also disrupting their strategy with cards like Skullcrack and Chained to the Rocks. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Stormbreath Dragon and Chandra's Phoenix provides additional threats and ways to close out the game."
