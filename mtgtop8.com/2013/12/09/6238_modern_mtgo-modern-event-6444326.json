The deck utilizes a toolbox strategy, meaning it has a wide range of creatures with different abilities that can be accessed as needed. The key concept is to efficiently chain together creatures using Birthing Pod to generate value and outmaneuver the opponent. The deck also includes disruptive creatures like Linvala, Keeper of Silence and Spellskite to disrupt the opponent's strategy while building up its own board presence."
