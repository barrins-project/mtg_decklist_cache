It also utilizes card draw and life gain with Sphinx's Revelation to outvalue the opponent. Jace, Architect of Thought provides card advantage and protection, while Thoughtseize disrupts the opponent's game plan. The win condition is either through controlling the game until Aetherling can close it out, or through finishing the opponent off with Blood Baron of Vizkopa. The deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
