By utilizing cards like Lightning Bolt, Rift Bolt, and Lava Spike, along with creatures like Young Pyromancer and Goblin Guide, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and maintain a fast pace throughout the game. The inclusion of counter spells like Remand offers some control elements, while cards like Grim Lavamancer provide additional removal options. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with consistent damage output and proactive plays."
