By utilizing cards like Desecration Demon, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, and Pack Rat, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total. Support cards such as Nightveil Specter provide additional advantage by letting you cast your opponent's spells. Thoughtseize helps disrupt the opponent's strategy while Hero's Downfall offers removal for problematic threats. With a high concentration of black mana symbols in the deck, the goal is to maximize the benefits of black devotion for a powerful offensive strategy."
