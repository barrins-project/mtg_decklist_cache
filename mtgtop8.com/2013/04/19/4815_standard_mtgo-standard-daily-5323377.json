It utilizes mana acceleration to quickly ramp into its high-cost threats like Thragtusk and Huntmaster of the Fells. Additionally, it has a strong late-game presence with cards like Olivia Voldaren and Rakdos's Return. The key strategy is to outvalue the opponent by efficiently trading resources and overwhelming them with powerful threats. Overall, the deck aims to control the game tempo and win through attrition."
