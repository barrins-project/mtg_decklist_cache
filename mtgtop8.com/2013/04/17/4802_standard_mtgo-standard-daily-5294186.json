The deck also includes ramp cards like Arbor Elf and Avacyn's Pilgrim to accelerate the mana needed to cast these big creatures. Lingering Souls provides additional value and protection, while cards like Loxodon Smiter and Thragtusk provide resilience and threats to the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and strong synergy between reanimation and ramp."

The key idea is to outvalue the opponent with a combination of removal, threats, and card advantage."
