Additionally, the deck utilizes efficient creatures like Invisible Stalker and Fencing Ace to apply pressure early on, while also having access to powerful spells like Simic Charm for versatility. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements while ensuring consistent access to different types of mana."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy using Naya Human creatures. By playing low-cost creatures like Boros Elite and Champion of the Parish, as well as efficient cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Lightning Mauler, you can quickly build a strong board presence. Cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Frontline Medic help disrupt your opponent's plans, while cards like Hellrider and Searing Spear provide additional reach and finishing power to close out games quickly. The mana base with Cavern of Souls and dual lands helps ensure a smooth and consistent curve."
