            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly fill up the graveyard with powerful creatures like Thragtusk and Angel of Serenity using cards like Grisly Salvage and Mulch, then bring them back into play with Unburial Rites. The combination of reanimating creatures and generating value with cards like Restoration Angel and Trostani, Selesnya's Voice allows for explosive and synergistic plays. Additionally, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with creatures like Acidic Slime and Loxodon Smiter, while also ramping up mana with cards like Avacyn's Pilgrim and Arbor Elf to facilitate its combos."
