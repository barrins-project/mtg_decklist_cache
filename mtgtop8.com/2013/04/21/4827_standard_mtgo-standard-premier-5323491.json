The inclusion of cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Boros Elite allows for quick mana ramp and explosive starts. The deck also includes a mix of burn spells like Searing Spear for removal and reach. With a mana base that supports fast plays and creature synergies, this deck aims to win through fast and relentless aggression."
