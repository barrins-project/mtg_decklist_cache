Cards like Grisly Salvage and Mulch help to fill the graveyard with targets for Unburial Rites, while mana dorks like Arbor Elf and Avacyn's Pilgrim ramp up to the big threats. The deck also includes some removal in Abrupt Decay and ways to generate value with cards like Thragtusk and Restoration Angel. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and close out the game quickly."
