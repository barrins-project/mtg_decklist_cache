Blasphemous Act serves as both a board wipe and a way to trigger effects from Blood Artist. Lingering Souls provides additional creatures and evasion, while Thundermaw Hellkite and Boros Reckoner offer powerful finishers. Slayers' Stronghold gives a final push of damage with its ability to grant haste and pump a creature."
