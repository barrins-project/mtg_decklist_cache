This allows you to overwhelm your opponent with big threats like Thragtusk, Obzedat, Ghost Council, and Angel of Serenity. The deck also utilizes the mana acceleration provided by Arbor Elf and Avacyn's Pilgrim to ramp into powerful finishers like Craterhoof Behemoth. Gavony Township provides additional value by pumping up your creatures, making them even harder to deal with."

The deck includes some small creatures like Centaur Healer and Deathrite Shaman to help stabilize in the early game, while also providing access to mana acceleration through cards like Avacyn's Pilgrim. By combining graveyard recursion with powerful creatures, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a powerful, synergistic combo strategy."
