The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of attackers while also having the ability to clear the board with cards like Blasphemous Act if necessary. The combination of creatures like Doomed Traveler and Blood Artist with powerful finishers like Falkenrath Aristocrat makes for a fast-paced and aggressive playstyle that can quickly take control of the game."
