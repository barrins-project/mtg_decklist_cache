The deck focuses on generating value from sacrificing creatures with abilities like Skirsdag High Priest and Cartel Aristocrat, while also using removal spells like Tragic Slip and Blasphemous Act to control the board. Lingering Souls provides additional bodies for sacrificing, while Faithless Looting helps with card selection. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of threats and incremental value."
