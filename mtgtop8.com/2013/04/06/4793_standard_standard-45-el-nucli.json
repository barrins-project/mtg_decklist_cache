By utilizing a combination of hexproof creatures like Invisible Stalker and Geist of Saint Traft, along with auras like Rancor and Ethereal Armor, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to respond. The use of mana fixing and ramp spells like Abundant Growth and Avacyn's Pilgrim helps to ensure a smooth mana curve and consistent plays."
