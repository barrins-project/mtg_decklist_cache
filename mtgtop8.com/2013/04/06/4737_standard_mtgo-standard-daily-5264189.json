The goal is to deploy creatures early and consistently deal damage with them while also using burn spells like Searing Spear and Brimstone Volley to finish off the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Boros Reckoner for added versatility and resilience.

Invisible Stalker and Geist of Saint Traft are particularly strong targets for these enchantments, as they are difficult to remove once hexproof is applied. By quickly building up your creatures and protecting them from removal spells, you aim to overwhelm your opponent and win the game swiftly."
