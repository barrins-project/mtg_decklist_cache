Control the game with counterspells like Remand and Condescend while digging for key cards with Thirst for Knowledge and Expedition Map. Finish off your opponent with giant threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Sundering Titan, while protecting yourself with cards like Platinum Angel. Academy Ruins can help recur important artifacts, ensuring you maintain control of the game until you can overwhelm your opponent."
