The main win condition is assembling enough lands with Valakut to deal lethal damage all at once, while also utilizing Primeval Titan to search for key lands and Prismatic Omen to ensure all lands count as mountains. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can go off with its combo finisher."

This mana is then used to control the game by countering opponent's spells, bouncing their creatures, and eventually locking them out of the game using cards like Mindslaver and Sundering Titan. The deck also aims to control the board with powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Platinum Angel while also maintaining card advantage with card draw effects like Thirst for Knowledge."
