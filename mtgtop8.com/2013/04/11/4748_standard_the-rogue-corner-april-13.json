            "notes": "The main idea of this Bant Aggro deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creatures and disruptive instants. By playing aggressive creatures like Geist of Saint Traft, Delver of Secrets, and Cloudfin Raptor, along with versatile instants like Simic Charm and Selesnya Charm, the deck aims to apply early pressure while being able to protect its creatures and deal with threats. The inclusion of efficient card draw and counter spells helps maintain tempo and adapt to different situations, making it a fast and versatile aggro deck."
