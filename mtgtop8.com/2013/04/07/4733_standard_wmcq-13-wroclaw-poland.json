The combo involves reanimating creatures like Angel of Serenity and Craterhoof Behemoth to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats. The deck also utilizes cards like Lingering Souls and Thragtusk for added value and board presence. The mana base includes a mix of dual lands and mana dorks to ensure smooth ramping and color fixing for the combo to work effectively."
