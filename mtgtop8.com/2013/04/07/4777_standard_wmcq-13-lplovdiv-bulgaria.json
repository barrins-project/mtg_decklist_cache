By playing efficient creatures like Gravecrawler and Geralf's Messenger, along with removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Tragic Slip, the deck aims to build a strong board presence early in the game. The addition of powerful cards like Falkenrath Aristocrat and Thundermaw Hellkite provide additional threats to close out the game quickly. The mana base is optimized to allow for consistent casting of both creatures and spells, ensuring a strong and relentless assault on the opponent."
