It also has efficient ramp and life gain cards to stabilize against aggressive decks. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful reanimated creatures while gaining incremental advantage through a mix of removal and value creatures like Thragtusk. The inclusion of cards like Restoration Angel and Lingering Souls helps to provide additional value and protection for the combo pieces."
