By playing efficient creatures like Champion of the Parish and Mayor of Avabruck, along with cards like Thatcher Revolt and Ghor-Clan Rampager, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and apply pressure on the opponent. Cards like Boros Elite and Silverblade Paladin help enhance the power of the creatures, while cards like Lightning Mauler and Frontline Medic provide additional support and protection. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure a consistent flow of creatures onto the battlefield."

The synergy between creatures like Champion of the Parish and Silverblade Paladin, along with cards like Boros Reckoner and Frontline Medic, allows for a strong and cohesive offense. Cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Fiend Hunter provide disruption for the opponent's strategy, while Boros Charm and Ajani, Caller of the Pride offer additional versatility and power. The mana base is designed to support a swift and efficient curve for playing multiple threats each turn."

By playing cards like Olivia Voldaren, Thragtusk, and Huntmaster of the Fells, along with removal spells like Dreadbore and Tragic Slip, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and establish board control. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Garruk, Primal Hunter provides additional utility and card advantage. Overall, the deck seeks to grind out games and overwhelm opponents with a combination of powerful threats and efficient removal."
