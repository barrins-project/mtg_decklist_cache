It also utilizes powerful creatures such as Tarmogoyf, Thrun, the Last Troll, and Kitchen Finks to apply pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to control the board while constantly chipping away at the opponent's life total, ultimately overwhelming them with its efficient threats and disruption."
