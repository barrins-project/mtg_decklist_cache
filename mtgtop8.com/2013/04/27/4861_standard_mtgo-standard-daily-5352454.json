Wolfir Silverheart and Ghor-Clan Rampager provide additional power and synergy, while Domri Rade helps with card advantage and creature removal. The mana base is focused on producing the right colors of mana to ensure consistency in casting spells. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
