By employing a low mana curve and high damage output, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with consistent damage every turn, without worrying much about board presence. The goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize or set up a defensive strategy. This deck prioritizes speed and efficiency in order to win as quickly as possible."
