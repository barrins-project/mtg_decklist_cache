The deck includes disruption spells like Dispel and Remand to protect the combo, as well as removal like Lightning Bolt. Serum Visions and Peek help with card selection and digging for combo pieces. The deck aims to quickly assemble the combo and win the game through overwhelming the opponent with a sudden influx of creatures."
