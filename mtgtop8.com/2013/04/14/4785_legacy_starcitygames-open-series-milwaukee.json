The combo relies on Sneak Attack to put these creatures into play for free, bypassing their high mana costs. The deck includes cards like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Lotus Petal to help dig for combo pieces and generate mana. It also runs counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect the combo. With the right cards and timing, the deck can quickly overwhelm opponents with its powerful creatures."
