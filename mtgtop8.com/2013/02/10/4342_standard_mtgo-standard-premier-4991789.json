The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of strong creatures and enter-the-battlefield effects, while also disrupting the opponent's gameplan with cards like Acidic Slime and Restoraton Angel. The synergy between reanimation spells and powerful creatures creates a potent combo that can quickly close out games."
