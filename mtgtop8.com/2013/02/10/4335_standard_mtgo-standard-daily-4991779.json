By consistently applying pressure early in the game with efficient threats like Stromkirk Noble and Rakdos Cackler, followed by powerful finishers like Hellrider and Boros Reckoner, the goal is to quickly deplete the opponent's life total before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of burn spells like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame also allows for additional reach and removal, making it difficult for the opponent to mount a defense."
