By playing low-cost creatures like Gravecrawler and Knight of Infamy early on, the deck can quickly build up a threatening board presence. The inclusion of strong Zombie lords like Geralf's Messenger and Falkenrath Aristocrat, along with removal spells like Searing Spear, allows the deck to maintain pressure and deal damage efficiently. The mana base is optimized for consistency and speed, with cards like Cavern of Souls and Woodland Cemetery ensuring that the deck can cast its threats on curve."

It also includes counterspells like Dissipate and Detention Sphere to deal with threats efficiently. The deck includes powerful creatures like Thragtusk and Angel of Serenity for stabilization and pressure. The key strategy is to outvalue the opponent by drawing cards, ramping into big threats, and controlling the board until the late game where the deck can take over with its powerful spells and creatures."
