The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures such as Champion of the Parish and Mayor of Avabruck while also having removal options like Searing Spear. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Restoration Angel and Huntmaster of the Fells provide both value and resilience to the deck. The mana base is focused on ensuring consistent access to the necessary colors for casting spells efficiently."
