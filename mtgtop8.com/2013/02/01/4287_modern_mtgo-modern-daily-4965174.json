Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to search for the UrzaTron lands efficiently. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Relic of Progenitus and Pyroclasm to control the opponent's resources and slow down their game plan. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats and control elements."
