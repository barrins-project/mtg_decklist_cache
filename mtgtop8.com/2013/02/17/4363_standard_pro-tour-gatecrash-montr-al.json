Utilizing sacrifice effects from Cartel Aristocrat and Skirsdag High Priest, the deck aims to generate value by sacrificing creatures to trigger abilities and buff other creatures. The addition of Zealous Conscripts allows for potential explosive plays by stealing opponent's creatures. Lingering Souls and Orzhov Charm provide additional utility and flexibility to deal with various threats. Overall, the deck focuses on efficient aggressive strategies while maintaining a synergistic sacrifice theme."
