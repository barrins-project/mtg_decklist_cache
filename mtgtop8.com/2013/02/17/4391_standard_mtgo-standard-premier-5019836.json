It also utilizes efficient creatures like Huntmaster of the Fells, Thragtusk, and Olivia Voldaren to stabilize the board and pressure the opponent. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color composition, allowing for consistent casting of powerful spells and creatures. The deck's win condition likely involves overwhelming the opponent with threats while disrupting their game plan."
