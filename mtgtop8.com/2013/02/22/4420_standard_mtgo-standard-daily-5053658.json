Overall, the deck aims to quickly establish a dominant board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

These creatures are supported by powerful spells like Boros Charm, Mizzium Mortars, and Domri Rade to control the board and deal direct damage. Thragtusk provides additional value and resilience, while Restoration Angel can both protect key creatures and provide additional aggression. By combining efficient creatures with versatile removal and burn spells, this deck aims to win the game through quick and aggressive plays."
