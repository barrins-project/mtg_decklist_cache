By utilizing mana ramp with Gyre Sage and Burning-Tree Emissary, the deck can quickly put pressure on the opponent with cards like Loxodon Smiter and Hellrider. Boros Reckoner provides a strong defensive option while also being able to dish out damage. Thundermaw Hellkite and Mizzium Mortars help to clear the opponent's board and push for a final blow. Domri Rade provides card advantage and additional creature support for a well-rounded aggressive strategy."
