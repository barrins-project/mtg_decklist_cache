By playing powerful cards like Dark Confidant, Tarmogoyf, and Bloodbraid Elf, backed up by efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Abrupt Decay, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's resources and overwhelm them with threats. The combination of hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach, along with powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil, ensures that the opponent has a hard time stabilizing and mounting a defense. Additionally, the inclusion of Punishing Fire provides recurring removal for small creatures, while Sensei's Divining Top helps to filter draws and find key cards."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by utilizing cards like Force of Will, Swords to Plowshares, and Terminus to deal with threats while maintaining card advantage through Brainstorm and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The deck also includes lock pieces such as Rest in Peace and Energy Field, along with the Helm of Obedience combo to establish a win condition. Overall, the deck aims to control the board and out-value the opponent to secure victory."
