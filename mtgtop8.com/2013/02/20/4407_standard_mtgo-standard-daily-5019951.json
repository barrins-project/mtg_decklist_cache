Burning-Tree Emissary helps to ramp up mana quickly, while Angel of Glory's Rise can bring back multiple creatures at once. The deck also includes a mix of dual lands to ensure consistent mana fixing for the combo to work effectively."

Cards like Jace, Memory Adept and Nephalia Drownyard are used to mill the opponent's deck and win through deck depletion, while Tamiyo, the Moon Sage provides additional card draw and removal. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game and outlasting the opponent."
