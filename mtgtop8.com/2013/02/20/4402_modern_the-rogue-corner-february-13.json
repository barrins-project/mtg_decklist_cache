By efficiently utilizing mana fixing lands to cast powerful multicolored spells that deal direct damage to the opponent, this deck aims to control the board and end the game quickly. The combination of aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide and Grim Lavamancer with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Boros Charm allows the player to maintain pressure and finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. The inclusion of versatile cards like Snapcaster Mage and Ajani Vengeant adds flexibility to the deck's strategy."
