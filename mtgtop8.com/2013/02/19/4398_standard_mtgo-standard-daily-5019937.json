The deck focuses on surviving the early game with cards like Supreme Verdict and Devour Flesh, then maintaining card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation and Nephalia Drownyard. Syncopate and Dissipate provide counterspells to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Snapcaster Mage allows for graveyard recursion. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent through efficient removal and card advantage, ultimately winning through a grindy control game."
