By playing aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide, Stormblood Berserker, and Flinthoof Boar, the deck aims to establish board presence early and keep the pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Rancor and Ghor-Clan Rampager further enhances the deck's ability to deal damage and close out games swiftly. Additionally, the deck features a low land count and mana curve to ensure a fast and streamlined gameplay."

By utilizing cards like Reshape and Open the Vaults, the deck aims to find and recur key pieces quickly, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Silence. The end goal is to either overwhelm the opponent with a massive Banefire or Grapeshot, or simply outvalue them by recurring powerful artifacts."
