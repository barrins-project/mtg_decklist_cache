Blood Artist provides additional reach and resilience, while Lotleth Troll offers a versatile and resilient threat that can grow quickly. The mana base supports consistent casting of creatures and spells, with Cavern of Souls offering protection against counterspells."

The deck's win condition is to generate card advantage and gain life with Sphinx's Revelation, eventually overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats like Restoration Angel and Kessig Wolf Run. This deck prioritizes reactive play and resource management to outlast the opponent."

The deck also includes disruption in the form of Devour Flesh and Banishing Stroke to control the opponent's board. The goal is to go wide with tokens and go for the win before the opponent can stabilize."
