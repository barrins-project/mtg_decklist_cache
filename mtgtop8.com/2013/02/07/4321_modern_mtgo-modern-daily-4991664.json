The deck focuses on using cards like Treasure Mage to search for key artifacts such as Wurmcoil Engine or Mindslaver, while also having counterspells like Condescend and Remand to control the opponent's plays. Additionally, cards like Academy Ruins and Oblivion Stone provide additional utility and control options. Overall, the deck aims to establish a dominant board state and out-value the opponent through powerful artifacts and resource management."
