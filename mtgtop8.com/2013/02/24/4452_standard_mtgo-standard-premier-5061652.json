The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with Farseek and efficient creature spells, such as Thragtusk and Restoration Angel, in order to outvalue the opponent. It also includes versatile cards like Azorius Charm for added control and Elvish Visionary for card selection. The deck aims to stabilize the board and generate incremental advantages until it can overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
