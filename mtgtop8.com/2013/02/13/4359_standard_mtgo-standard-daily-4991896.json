By utilizing cards like Faithless Looting, Grisly Salvage, and Mulch, the deck aims to set up a combo where Angel of Glory's Rise can return a combination of Cartel Aristocrat, Fiend Hunter, and Cathedral Sanctifier for a powerful board presence. The deck also includes Huntmaster of the Fells for additional value and consistency in the reanimation strategy."
