The goal is to reanimate multiple creatures in one turn to overwhelm the opponent and win the game through a big combo play. The inclusion of Faithless Looting and Burning-Tree Emissary helps with card selection and mana ramp, making it easier to execute the reanimation combo efficiently. The deck also includes some disruption with Fiend Hunter and the mana base is designed to support the multiple colored requirements of the deck."

With a lineup of efficient creatures like Stromkirk Noble, Rakdos Cackler, and Boros Reckoner, backed up by burn spells like Pillar of Flame and Searing Spear, this deck aims to end the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize. The key strategy is to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to make suboptimal plays in order to survive the onslaught."
