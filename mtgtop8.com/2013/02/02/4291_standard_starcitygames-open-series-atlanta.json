The key strategy is to establish an early board presence with cards like Champion of the Parish and Mayor of Avabruck, and then using pump effects from cards like Silverblade Paladin to deal large amounts of damage in a short amount of time. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben also helps disrupt the opponent's game plan while Restoration Angel provides versatility and evasion. The deck aims to curve out efficiently and apply pressure to the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."

By using cards like Faithless Looting and Grisly Salvage to fill the graveyard with creatures, the deck can then use Unburial Rites to reanimate them onto the battlefield. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Huntmaster of the Fells to provide extra value and disruption to the opponent. Through these synergies, the deck aims to create a powerful board presence and overwhelm the opponent with its reanimated threats."
