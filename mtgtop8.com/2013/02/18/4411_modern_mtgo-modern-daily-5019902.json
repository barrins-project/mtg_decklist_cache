The mana base is constructed to support the combo pieces with fetchlands and dual lands.

The deck aims to use cards like Goblin Electromancer and Pyromancer's Swath to reduce the cost of spells and draw cards to dig deeper into the deck for combo pieces. By careful manipulation of resources and timing, the deck looks to overwhelm the opponent with a lethal storm of spells in a single turn."
