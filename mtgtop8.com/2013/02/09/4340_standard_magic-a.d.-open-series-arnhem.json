By playing a low curve of powerful and efficient creatures like Boros Reckoner and Ash Zealot, combined with burn spells like Pillar of Flame and Brimstone Volley, the goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. The deck also gains value from cards like Hellrider and Lightning Mauler, which provide additional damage and haste. Overall, the strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent and finish the game swiftly."
