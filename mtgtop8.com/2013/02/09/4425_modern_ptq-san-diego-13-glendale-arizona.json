The deck also includes cards like Silence and Gitaxian Probe to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own combo. Through careful sequencing and manipulation of resources, the deck can set up a game-winning turn."

The deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's resources while maintaining card advantage and board presence, ultimately overwhelming them before they can stabilize. Additionally, the deck utilizes efficient mana fixing and lands that can double as threats to further increase its overall versatility and power level."
