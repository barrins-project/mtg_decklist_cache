The deck aims to control the board with a combination of tempo plays and efficient removal spells, while applying pressure on your opponent with creatures that can quickly end the game. The mana base is set up to support the deck's three-color requirements while also providing consistent access to all types of mana needed for the spells in the deck."

It focuses on the Rakdos color combination, using cards like Blood Crypt and Cavern of Souls to support the aggressive strategy. The deck includes creatures like Falkenrath Aristocrat, Geralf's Messenger, and Knight of Infamy, which are difficult to deal with and can quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. It also includes burn spells like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame to clear the way for the creatures and deal direct damage to the opponent."
