Thalia, Guardian of Thraben helps to slow down opponent's spells while Silverblade Paladin and Angel of Jubilation provide additional aggressive threats. Gavony Township can buff up your creatures further and give them an edge in combat. Faith's Shield offers protection for your key creatures, while Mayor of Avabruck and Precinct Captain provide additional creature support for the deck's overall aggressive strategy."
