This mana is then used to cast powerful spells and threats like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre, as well as control cards like Karn Liberated and Mindslaver. The deck also includes cards like All Is Dust and Oblivion Stone to clear the board of opposing threats, while cards like Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying help to find the necessary pieces to assemble the UrzaTron lands."
