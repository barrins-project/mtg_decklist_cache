Blood Artist and Cartel Aristocrat help drain the opponent's life total while generating advantage from sacrificing creatures. Cards like Blasphemous Act and Tragic Slip provide removal options to clear the way for attacks. Sorin, Lord of Innistrad can provide additional threats and tokens, while Orzhov Charm offers versatility in dealing with threats. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistent access to all the necessary colors for this aggressive Aristocrats strategy."
