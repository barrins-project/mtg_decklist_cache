Disruption through counter spells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce is used to protect the board state, while also utilizing tempo plays like Daze to slow down the opponent. Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, while cards like Standstill provide card advantage in longer games. The deck's mana base is streamlined with a mix of Islands, Wastelands, and Mutavaults to ensure consistent and aggressive starts."

The mana base is optimized for consistency and efficiency, with a focus on blue and red dual lands. Overall, the deck is built to apply pressure early and maintain tempo throughout the game."
