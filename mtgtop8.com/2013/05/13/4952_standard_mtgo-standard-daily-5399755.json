By playing low-cost creatures like Rakdos Cackler and Stromkirk Noble, and utilizing pump spells like Ghor-Clan Rampager, the deck aims to deal early damage and maintain pressure on the opponent. Additionally, cards like Hellrider and Boros Reckoner provide additional reach and damage potential. Overall, the strategy is to be fast and relentless, attacking the opponent relentlessly until victory is achieved."
