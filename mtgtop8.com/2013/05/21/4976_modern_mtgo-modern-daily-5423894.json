            "notes": "This modern deck focuses on quickly gaining life points by playing cards like Soul Warden and Martyr of Sands, enabling powerful creatures like Serra Ascendant and Ajani's Pridemate to become threats early on. The deck also includes cards like Squadron Hawk and Spectral Procession to flood the board with creatures, while Honor of the Pure boosts their power. Aven Mindcensor disrupts the opponent's search effects, and Path to Exile provides removal.
