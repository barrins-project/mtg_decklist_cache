By incorporating cards like Snapcaster Mage, Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and Vedalken Shackles, the deck aims to control the board through counterspells and card advantage. The inclusion of Sensei's Divining Top and Counterbalance provides additional control by manipulating the top card of the library. Overall, the strategy of this deck revolves around control and disruption to outplay the opponent and secure victory."
