The deck focuses on playing efficient, low-cost creatures like Stromkirk Noble, Rakdos Cackler, and Burning-Tree Emissary to quickly deal damage to the opponent. By utilizing burn spells such as Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame, the deck can clear a path for its creatures to continue attacking. The inclusion of powerful cards like Hellrider and Boros Reckoner allows the deck to maintain pressure and close out games quickly."
