The deck also includes versatile spells like Azorius Charm and Restoration Angel for utility and card advantage. Ral Zarek adds additional flexibility with his abilities, while turn / burn can deal with problematic creatures. The mana base is well-balanced to support the deck's aggressive game plan."

The deck also includes cards like Grisly Salvage and Mulch to help with graveyard filling, as well as creatures like Sin Collector and Fiend Hunter for disruption and removal. The mana base includes a mix of dual lands to ensure smooth casting, while also incorporating Gavony Township for late-game boosts."
