Additionally, cards like Sphinx's Revelation and Garruk, Primal Hunter provide card advantage and incremental value, while cards like Jace, Memory Adept and Aetherling offer win conditions to close out the game. The mana base is optimized for consistent and flexible mana access to support the control strategy."
