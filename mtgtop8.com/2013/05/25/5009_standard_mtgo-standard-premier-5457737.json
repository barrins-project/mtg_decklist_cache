            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly building a board presence with low-cost creatures that can be sacrificed to trigger effects like Blood Artist and Falkenrath Aristocrat. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and removal spells while also gaining incremental advantages through sacrificing creatures. Blasphemous Act can be a game-changing board wipe, while cards like Sin Collector disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base is designed to consistently hit the deck's color requirements to ensure smooth gameplay. Overall, this deck aims to be aggressive and disruptive in equal measure."
