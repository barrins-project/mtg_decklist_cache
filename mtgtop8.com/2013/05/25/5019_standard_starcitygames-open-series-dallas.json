By leveraging cards like Dissipate, Supreme Verdict, and Azorius Charm, along with powerful planeswalkers like Tamiyo and Jace, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through incremental advantages. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Aetherling and Sphinx's Revelation helps to close out the game once the opponent has been sufficiently disrupted. By maintaining a balance of disruption, card draw, and finishers, the deck is designed to grind out victories in longer games."
