By using cards like Liliana of the Veil, Dreadbore, and Abrupt Decay to remove threats, while also utilizing Farseek to ramp up your mana and play powerful threats like Huntmaster of the Fells and Thragtusk, you can create a strong board presence and outvalue your opponent. Olivia Voldaren and Sire of Insanity provide additional ways to disrupt your opponent's hand and board state, while cards like Bonfire of the Damned can act as a game-ending finisher."
