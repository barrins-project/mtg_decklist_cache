            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by ramping up mana quickly with cards like Search for Tomorrow and Farseek, while also disrupting the opponent's plans with counter spells like Remand and removal spells like Pyroclasm. The ultimate goal is to get Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle on the battlefield along with enough Mountains to deal lethal damage with Scapeshift. Cards like Primeval Titan and Obstinate Baloth provide additional threats or protection, while Prismatic Omen ensures all lands count as Mountains for maximum damage potential."
