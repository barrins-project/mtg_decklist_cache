This strategy allows the player to apply consistent pressure on the opponent's life total while generating value from sacrificing creatures. Blasphemous Act and Tragic Slip provide removal options to control the board, and Lingering Souls offers a resilient threat that can generate tokens for sacrifice. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and efficient sacrifice synergies."
