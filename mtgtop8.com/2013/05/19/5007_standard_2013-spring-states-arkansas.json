By protecting your creatures with hexproof and evasion abilities, such as flying and unblockable, you can quickly overwhelm your opponent and secure a fast victory. The deck utilizes cards like Unflinching Courage, Spectral Flight, and Ethereal Armor to boost your creatures' power and toughness, while also providing extra protection with cards like Simic Charm. Overall, the strategy is to go all-in on aggressive creatures and auras to outpace and overpower your opponent."

With a focus on Mono Black Control, the deck features key cards such as Liliana of the Veil, Desecration Demon, and Thragtusk to manage the board and apply pressure. Removal spells like Victim of Night, Tragic Slip, and Abrupt Decay help deal with threats, while card draw spells like Sign in Blood and Disciple of Bolas provide card advantage. The deck also includes some ramp spells like Woodland Cemetery and Overgrown Tomb to help cast bigger threats earlier in the game."
