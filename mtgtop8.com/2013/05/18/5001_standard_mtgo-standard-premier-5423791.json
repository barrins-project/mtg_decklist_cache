The deck also includes mana accelerators like Avacyn's Pilgrim and Arbor Elf to ramp into powerful creatures like Angel of Serenity and Craterhoof Behemoth. The strategy focuses on overwhelming the opponent with powerful creatures while utilizing graveyard recursion to maintain board presence and pressure."
