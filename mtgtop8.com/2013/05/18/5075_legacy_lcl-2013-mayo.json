The deck utilizes powerful rituals and fast mana acceleration like Lion's Eye Diamond and Lotus Petal to quickly build up mana for big plays. Burning Wish allows the player to search the sideboard for additional combo pieces or answers to opposing threats. Ad Nauseam and Past in Flames provide additional card advantage and recursion to keep the combo going. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a massive storm count and close out the game in a single turn."

By casting a series of spells that generate storm triggers, such as Dark Ritual and Cabal Ritual, the deck aims to finish off the opponent with a lethal Tendrils of Agony. The deck utilizes cantrips like Ponder and Preordain to find the pieces needed for the combo, while using cards like Duress and Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck focuses on creating a powerful storm turn to overwhelm the opponent and win the game."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly filling the graveyard with powerful creatures using cards like Entomb, Careful Study, and Brainstorm, then bringing them back into play with cards like Exhume, Reanimate, and Animate Dead. The key strategy is to cheat out big threats like Griselbrand, Elesh Norn, and Jin-Gitaxias early in the game, overwhelming the opponent with a powerful reanimated army. The deck also includes cards like Force of Will and Daze for protection, ensuring that the combo goes off smoothly and efficiently."
