The goal is to quickly assemble enough lands to trigger Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle's ability and deal a massive amount of damage to the opponent. The deck utilizes card draw and deck manipulation to find its key pieces, while also having a backup plan with Snapcaster Mage for additional value. It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win condition through careful resource management and strategic plays."
