By sacrificing creatures to abilities like Falkenrath Aristocrat and Cartel Aristocrat, paired with effects like Blood Artist, players can drain their opponent's life total quickly. Lingering Souls provides additional creatures to sacrifice, while cards like Tragic Slip and Blasphemous Act help control the board. Sorin, Lord of Innistrad provides additional value and Olivia Voldaren can steal opposing creatures. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and attrition."
