            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game through counterspells, removal spells, and board wipes, while drawing cards to maintain card advantage and gain life through Sphinx's Revelation. The deck aims to stabilize the board with Supreme Verdict and Warleader's Helix, while using Restoration Angel, Augur of Bolas, and Snapcaster Mage as creatures to pressure the opponent. The mana base is built to support the Jeskai color combination and allow for consistency in casting spells. The inclusion of utility lands like Desolate Lighthouse and Moorland Haunt provide additional value in the late game."
