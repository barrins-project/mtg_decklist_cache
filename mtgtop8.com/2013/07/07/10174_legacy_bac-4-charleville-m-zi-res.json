It includes cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor for card advantage, Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top for controlling the board, and Back to Basics to disrupt mana bases. The deck aims to control the game through countering key spells, manipulating the top of the library, and eventually winning through a combination of card advantage and efficient removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Terminus."
