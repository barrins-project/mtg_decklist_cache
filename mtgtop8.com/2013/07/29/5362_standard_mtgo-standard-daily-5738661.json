By playing aggressive creatures like Rakdos Cackler, Mogg Flunkies, and Legion Loyalist alongside burn spells like Shock, Searing Spear, and Pillar of Flame, the goal is to deal damage as quickly as possible and finish the game before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Hellrider and Firefist Striker provide additional ways to push through damage and close out games. With a low mana curve and efficient threats, this deck aims to win through sheer aggression."
