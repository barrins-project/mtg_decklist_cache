The planeswalker Garruk, Primal Hunter provides card advantage, while Rakdos's Return can act as a game-ending finisher. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through efficient removal and powerful creatures."

By utilizing powerful creatures like Voice of Resurgence, Thundermaw Hellkite, and Boros Reckoner, along with strong removal like Bonfire of the Damned and Selesnya Charm, the deck aims to quickly establish board presence and deal significant damage before the opponent can stabilize. Additionally, cards like Domri Rade and Gavony Township provide additional value and synergy with the creature-based strategy. The deck's mana base is carefully constructed to support the aggressive game plan and allow for consistent access to all colors needed for powerful plays."
