Utilizing cards like Tragic Slip, Lingering Souls, and Falkenrath Aristocrat, the deck aims to create a relentless aggressive strategy that overwhelms the opponent. With cards like Blood Artist and Cartel Aristocrat providing additional damage and synergy with sacrificing creatures, the deck seeks to pressure opponents and maintain board control. Additionally, cards like Skirsdag High Priest and Blasphemous Act offer alternative win conditions and board wipes to handle different situations."
