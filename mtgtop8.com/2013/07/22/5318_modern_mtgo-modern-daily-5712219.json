The deck focuses on playing efficient and powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf, Goblin Guide, and Flinthoof Boar while utilizing burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Seal of Fire to clear the way for attacks. By combining fast and efficient creatures with burn spells for removal, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and end the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."

The deck aims to control the game through discard and disruption until it can assemble its combo and win the game in a single explosive turn."
