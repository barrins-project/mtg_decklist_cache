The deck also includes cards like Restoration Angel and Fiend Hunter to help control the board and protect your key combo pieces. By reanimating big creatures like Angel of Serenity and Thragtusk, you can overwhelm your opponent and quickly close out the game. The land base is optimized to ensure you have the right colors to cast your spells consistently."
