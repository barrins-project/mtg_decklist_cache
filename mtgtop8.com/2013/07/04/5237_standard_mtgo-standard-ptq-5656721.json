It also utilizes sacrifice outlets such as Cartel Aristocrat and Varolz, the Scar-Striped to trigger abilities like Blood Artist. The deck focuses on aggressive plays while also having some resilience and value generation through cards like Tragic Slip and Garruk Relentless. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's strategy and maximize its potential."
