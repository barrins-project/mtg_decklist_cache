It aims to maintain board presence and denial through a combination of removal, protection, and lifegain, eventually overwhelming the opponent with powerful creatures like Desecration Demon and Geralf's Messenger. Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and discard, while Mutilate acts as a board wipe. The deck's mana base ensures consistent casting of spells and creatures while also allowing for flexibility in playing both green and black spells."

            "notes": "The key concept of this Esper Control deck is to have a strong control over the game through removal spells, counter spells, and card advantage. The deck focuses on countering threats, wiping the board with Supreme Verdict, gaining card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation, and having versatile answers with various removal spells. With powerful finishers like Blood Baron of Vizkopa and Aetherling, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent, eventually closing out the game with overwhelming card advantage and effective control of the board."
