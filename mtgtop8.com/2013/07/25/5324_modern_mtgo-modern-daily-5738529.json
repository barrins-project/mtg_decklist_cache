            "notes": "The deck focuses on overwhelming the opponent with cheap artifacts that can be quickly deployed and buffed with cards like Cranial Plating and Steel Overseer. Using aggressive creatures like Signal Pest and Vault Skirge, along with burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Shrapnel Blast, the strategy is to apply constant pressure on the opponent while keeping up a strong board presence. The mana base is streamlined for efficiency, allowing for quick deployment of threats and maximizing the potential of cards like Mox Opal. Overall, the deck aims to quickly close out games through aggressive plays and explosive finishes."
