Additional value comes from cards like Garruk Relentless and Skirsdag High Priest, while Varolz, the Scar-Striped and Scavenging Ooze provide graveyard interaction and potential for additional aggression. The mana base includes both shock lands and check lands to ensure consistent access to all colors."

By utilizing cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Arbor Elf for fast mana ramp, Gruul Aggro aims to get ahead on the board early on. Cards like Hellrider and Ghor-Clan Rampager provide additional ways to push through damage and close out games. With a mix of efficient creatures and removal spells like Mizzium Mortars, this deck looks to maintain pressure and force opponents to react while building up a powerful board presence."
