The deck aims to control the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Pillar of Flame, while also using card advantage and card selection from cards like Azorius Charm and Jace, Architect of Thought. Tamiyo, the Moon Sage can help lock down opponents' threats, while Snapcaster Mage allows for additional value by casting spells from the graveyard."
