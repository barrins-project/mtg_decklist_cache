The deck uses powerful colorless threats like Emrakul and Ulamog to quickly close out games once the Tron lands are assembled. Control elements like Karn Liberated and Oblivion Stone provide disruption and removal to control the game until the big threats can come down. The deck also includes card selection and mana fixing with cards like Ancient Stirrings, Sylvan Scrying, and Chromatic Sphere/Star to ensure consistency and smooth gameplay."

The deck aims to pressure the opponent early with creatures like Tarmogoyf and Loxodon Smiter, while disrupting their game plan with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Abrupt Decay. Doran, the Siege Tower acts as a powerful anthem effect for the deck, while cards like Fulminator Mage and Maelstrom Pulse provide additional disruption against various strategies. Liliana of the Veil helps control the board and grind out value in longer games. The mana base is designed to support the three-color nature of the deck while maximizing consistency and flexibility."
