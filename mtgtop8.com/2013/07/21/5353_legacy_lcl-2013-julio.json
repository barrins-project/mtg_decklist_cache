With Dream Halls in play, players can cast Enter the Infinite for free, drawing their entire deck and setting up for a game-winning turn. Cunning Wish allows for versatility in finding answers or alternate win conditions, creating a high-risk, high-reward gameplay experience."

Cards like Daze and Force of Will provide disruption and protection, while Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment. Standstill can slow down the opponent's game plan, giving the merfolk player time to establish their board presence. Wasteland and Mutavault provide additional utility and flexibility in controlling the battlefield."
