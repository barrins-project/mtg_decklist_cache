By utilizing cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Ghor-Clan Rampager, the deck aims to quickly build up a strong board presence and deal damage rapidly. Cards like Hellrider and Thundermaw Hellkite provide additional firepower and finishers to close out the game. With a mix of mana ramp and efficient creatures, Gruul Aggro aims to pressure the opponent early and maintain that pressure throughout the game until victory is secured."
