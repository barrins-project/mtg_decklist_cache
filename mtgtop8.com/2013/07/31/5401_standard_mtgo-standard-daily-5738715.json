            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly buffing up evasive creatures with auras and enchantments to deal massive damage to the opponent. The key strategy is to create unstoppable threats that are difficult to remove or block, overwhelming the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of hexproof creatures and auras protects the key pieces from removal spells, allowing the deck to maintain consistent pressure and close out games quickly. The deck aims to win the game before the opponent can establish a board presence or answer the threats effectively."
