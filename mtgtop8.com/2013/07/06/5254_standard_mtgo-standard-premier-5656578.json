Cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Voice of Resurgence disrupt opponents' game plans while providing additional threats. Domri Rade provides card advantage and removal, while Mizzium Mortars and Selesnya Charm offer versatile removal options. Gavony Township provides a late-game mana sink to further enhance your creatures' power."
