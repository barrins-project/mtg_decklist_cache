By playing low-cost creatures like Champion of the Parish and Burning-Tree Emissary early on, the deck can quickly build a strong board presence. Cards like Boros Elite, Mayor of Avabruck, and Lightning Mauler provide additional support and buff effects, while Ghor-Clan Rampager and Frontline Medic offer combat tricks and protection. The inclusion of Cavern of Souls ensures that the human creatures can't be countered, further solidifying the deck's aggressive game plan."

Additionally, cards like Acidic Slime and Fiend Hunter provide value when they enter the battlefield, and cards like Restoration Angel can be used to blink creatures for additional value. The deck also includes mana ramp creatures like Arbor Elf and Avacyn's Pilgrim to help cast the spells needed for the combo."
