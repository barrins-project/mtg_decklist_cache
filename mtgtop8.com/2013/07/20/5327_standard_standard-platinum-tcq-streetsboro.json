Tamiyo, the Moon Sage and Sorin, Lord of Innistrad provide additional card advantage and options for controlling the board. The deck also includes some lifegain elements and a small mill strategy with Nephalia Drownyard. The key strategy is to outlast the opponent and grind them down with powerful control cards."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and pump spells, while also utilizing mana acceleration to get ahead in the game. The deck focuses on playing high-value creatures like Voice of Resurgence and Boros Reckoner, with support from cards like Domri Rade and Selesnya Charm. The inclusion of removal spells like Mizzium Mortars helps the deck maintain board control. The mana base is optimized to ensure consistent access to all colors needed for the deck's strategy. The inclusion of Gavony Township provides additional late-game reach and board presence."
