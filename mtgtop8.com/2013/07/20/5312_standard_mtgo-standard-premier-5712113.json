Creatures like Invisible Stalker and Geist of Saint Traft are difficult to deal with once they have been enchanted, while Ajani, Caller of the Pride provides additional buffs and Voice of Resurgence creates a token when it dies. With a mix of evasion and protection spells, this deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive, hard-to-remove threats."
