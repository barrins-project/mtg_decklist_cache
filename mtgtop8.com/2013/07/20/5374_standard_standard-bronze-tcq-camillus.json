By combining green's powerful creatures with blue's disruptive countermagic and bounce effects, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and maintain board control throughout the game. The inclusion of cards like Rancor and Abundant Growth helps provide additional value and versatility to the deck, allowing for both aggressive plays and strategic maneuvers. Overall, the deck focuses on tempo, aggression, and adaptability to secure victory in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
