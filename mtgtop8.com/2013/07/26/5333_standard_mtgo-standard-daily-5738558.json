The deck also includes card advantage engines like Garruk, Primal Hunter and Olivia Voldaren to outvalue the opponent. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistent access to all colors necessary for casting spells."

By efficiently removing threats, ramping into powerful creatures, and generating card advantage, the deck aims to dominate the board and overwhelm opponents with its strong threats. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's multicolored requirements, allowing for consistency in casting the spells and creatures needed to control the game. Ultimately, the goal is to grind out wins through attrition and incremental advantage."
