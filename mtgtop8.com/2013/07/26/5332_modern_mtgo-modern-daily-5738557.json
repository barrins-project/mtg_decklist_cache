The key is to disrupt your opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek while also applying pressure with powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf and Huntmaster of the Fells. Liliana of the Veil and other removal spells help to keep the opponent's threats in check, while Ajani Vengeant provides additional disruption and burn damage. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the color requirements of the deck's spells. Overall, the strategy is to control the game early on and finish with a strong board presence."

By utilizing cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Leonin Arbiter to tax the opponent's resources and prevent them from playing their spells efficiently, this deck aims to control the game tempo and grind out wins through attrition. Additionally, cards like Aether Vial and Flickerwisp provide versatility and allow for unexpected plays to catch the opponent off guard."
