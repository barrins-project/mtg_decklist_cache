Cards like Cryptic Command and Mana Leak provide further control, while Vedalken Shackles allows for stealing opponent's creatures. The deck also features utility lands like Mutavault and Tectonic Edge to give additional advantage. Overall, the strategy revolves around countering opponent's spells, controlling the board state, and ultimately outvaluing the opponent with faerie synergies."
