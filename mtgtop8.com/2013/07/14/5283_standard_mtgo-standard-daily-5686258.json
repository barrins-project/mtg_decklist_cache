The deck aims to stall the game with board wipes like Supreme Verdict and Terminus, while controlling the opponent's threats with cards like Detention Sphere and Devour Flesh. Card advantage is gained through Sphinx's Revelation and Think Twice, while Snapcaster Mage provides additional value by recasting key spells from the graveyard. The win condition is often through milling the opponent with Nephalia Drownyard or by overwhelming them with card advantage and powerful threats like Jace, Memory Adept."

The deck also includes win conditions such as Aetherling, Olivia Voldaren, and Rakdos's Return to close out the game once the opponent has been neutralized. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the three-color combination of Grixis while providing consistency and flexibility in casting spells of different colors. The deck focuses on outlasting opponents through efficient removal and powerful late-game threats."
