Supporting cards like Restoration Angel and Fiend Hunter provide additional value and control over the game. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize the chances of casting key spells."

By utilizing sacrifice effects and triggers from cards like Blood Artist and Falkenrath Aristocrat, the deck aims to chip away at the opponent's life total while controlling the board with removal spells like Tragic Slip and Blasphemous Act. The addition of planeswalker Sorin, Lord of Innistrad provides additional synergy and support for the strategy. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the tri-color requirements of the deck."
