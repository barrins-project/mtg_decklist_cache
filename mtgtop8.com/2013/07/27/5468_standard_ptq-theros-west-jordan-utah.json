By using cards like Thragtusk and Huntmaster of the Fells to generate value, alongside removal spells like Bonfire of the Damned and Putrefy, the deck aims to maintain control of the game. Additionally, the inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Garruk, Primal Hunter and efficient threats like Olivia Voldaren provide additional ways to outvalue opponents. By efficiently managing resources and establishing board dominance, the deck aims to outlast and outvalue opponents to secure the win."

By adding powerful aura enchantments like Unflinching Courage, Rancor, and Ethereal Armor, these creatures can quickly become highly threatening and difficult for opponents to deal with. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Geist of Saint Traft and Silverblade Paladin to provide additional aggressive options and close out games quickly. The mana base is designed to support the Bant color combination for consistency in casting spells."
