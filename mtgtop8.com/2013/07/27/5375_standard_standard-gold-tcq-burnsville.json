The deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on with cards like Stromkirk Noble and Burning-Tree Emissary, supported by powerful cards like Boros Reckoner and Hellrider. The inclusion of removal spells like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame helps to clear the way for attacks, while aggressive creatures like Ghor-Clan Rampager and Flinthoof Boar put pressure on opponents. The deck's strategy is to apply constant pressure and win the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
