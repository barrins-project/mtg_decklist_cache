The inclusion of versatile planeswalkers like Sorin, Lord of Innistrad and Garruk Relentless provides additional value and options for generating advantage."

The deck also includes ramp cards like Avacyn's Pilgrim and Arbor Elf to accelerate into bigger threats like Craterhoof Behemoth. Acidic Slime provides utility by destroying problematic artifacts or lands."
