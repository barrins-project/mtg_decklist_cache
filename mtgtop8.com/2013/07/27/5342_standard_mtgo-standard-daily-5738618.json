The deck aims to take advantage of powerful enters-the-battlefield abilities of creatures like Angel of Serenity and Thragtusk, while also utilizing cards like Restoration Angel and Obzedat, Ghost Council for added value and control. The deck also includes mana ramp creatures like Arbor Elf and Avacyn's Pilgrim to accelerate its strategy and ensure fast reanimation of key creatures."
