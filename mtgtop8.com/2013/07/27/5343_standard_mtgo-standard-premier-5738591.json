By using a combination of burn spells, counterspells, and efficient creatures, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while applying pressure with creatures like Thundermaw Hellkite and Aurelia, the Warleader. The inclusion of cards like Snapcaster Mage and Sphinx's Revelation provide flexibility and card advantage, allowing the deck to adapt to different game situations. Overall, the deck focuses on aggression and tempo to secure a victory in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
