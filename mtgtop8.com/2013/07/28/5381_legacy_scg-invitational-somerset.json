The deck aims to stabilize the board with versatile threats like Knight of the Reliquary and Tarmogoyf, while also utilizing Devastating Dreams as a board wipe if necessary. The mana base is tailored to support the strategy with a mix of utility lands and Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's resources."
