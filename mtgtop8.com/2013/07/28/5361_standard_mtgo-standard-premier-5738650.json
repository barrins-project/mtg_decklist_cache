The addition of cards like Xathrid Necromancer and Cartel Aristocrat further enhances the synergy of sacrificing creatures and creating a powerful board state. The deck also includes some planeswalkers like Sorin, Lord of Innistrad and Olivia Voldaren to provide additional support and options for winning the game."
