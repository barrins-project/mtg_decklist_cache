The burn spells like Searing Spear and Hellrider provide additional reach to finish off the opponent. Overall, the main goal is to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react defensively, ultimately leading to victory through sheer aggression."

The deck also includes some counter spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The key strategy is to tempo out opponents with efficient creatures like Restoration Angel and control the game with versatile removal like Turn / Burn and Warleader's Helix. The deck aims to pressure the opponent early and keep them on the back foot throughout the game."
