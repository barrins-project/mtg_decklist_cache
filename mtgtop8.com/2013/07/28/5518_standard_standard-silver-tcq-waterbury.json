By leveraging cards like Thundermaw Hellkite and Hellrider, along with quick burn spells like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame, the deck aims to apply continuous pressure and finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. Mutavault provides additional versatility and Boros Reckoner offers a powerful threat that can also keep the opponent on their toes. The deck's focus is on fast, relentless aggression to overwhelm the opponent."
