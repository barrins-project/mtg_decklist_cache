The mana base is designed to support the Jund color combination, allowing for flexibility in casting spells from all three colors. Overall, the deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent to secure victory."

By using cards like Unburial Rites and Grisly Salvage to fill the graveyard with creatures, the deck can quickly bring back threats like Angel of Serenity and Thragtusk. The deck also includes removal spells like Putrefy and Abrupt Decay to deal with opposing threats, while mana ramp cards like Avacyn's Pilgrim and Arbor Elf help accelerate the deck's game plan. Overall, the key concept is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful reanimated creatures."
