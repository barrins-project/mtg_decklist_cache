Geist of Saint Traft and Silverblade Paladin provide additional threats and buff support for the aggressive strategy, while Increasing Savagery can further enhance the power of the enchanted creatures. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and hard-hitting approach."

Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame provide additional reach and removal, while cards like Hellrider and Pyreheart Wolf enhance the deck's ability to push through damage and maintain pressure. The inclusion of Hellion Crucible and Brimstone Volley offer additional threats and reach to close out games efficiently."
