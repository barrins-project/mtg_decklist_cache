By playing low-cost creatures like Stromkirk Noble and Rakdos Cackler alongside powerful finishers like Hellrider and Thundermaw Hellkite, the deck aims to end the game swiftly before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of burn spells like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame adds another layer of reach and removal, ensuring that the opponent is unable to mount a counterattack. The deck's strategy is straightforward but effective, focusing on speed and direct damage to secure victory."
