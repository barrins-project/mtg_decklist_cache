By casting multiple cheap spells in a single turn and utilizing cards like Epic Experiment and Past in Flames, the deck aims to chain together a sequence of spells to eventually cast Grapeshot for lethal damage. Gitaxian Probe and Sleight of Hand helps to dig for combo pieces, while Serum Visions and Peer Through Depths help with card selection and manipulation."
