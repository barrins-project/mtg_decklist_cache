The deck uses a combination of hand disruption spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Abrupt Decay, and powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to control the game and prevent the opponent from stabilizing. Additionally, the deck can use Boom / Bust to disrupt the opponent's mana base and gain a tempo advantage, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with a steady stream of threats."
