            "notes": "This Modern deck utilizes aggressive creatures and efficient removal spells to control the board and deal damage quickly to the opponent. The key strategy revolves around using Isochron Scepter to repeatedly cast powerful instant spells like Lightning Bolt and Lightning Helix, while also taking advantage of cards like Vendilion Clique and Snapcaster Mage for additional utility. The inclusion of counterspells like Mana Leak and Remand helps protect your key threats while disrupting your opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure and maintain control of the game through a mix of aggro and control elements."
