Through mana acceleration with cards like Skirk Prospector and Aether Vial, the deck aims to flood the board with goblins quickly and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. Additionally, disruptive elements like Stingscourger and Gempalm Incinerator provide a way to deal with threats and maintain pressure on the opponent. The deck's strategy revolves around fast, explosive starts and maintaining a dominant board presence throughout the game."
