This allows the player to survive the early game and stall until they can start drawing into their win conditions, such as Sphinx's Revelation or Nephalia Drownyard, to outvalue the opponent and secure victory. The deck focuses on maintaining board control and resource advantage to overwhelm the opponent in the late game."
