Creatures like Goblin Guide and Vexing Devil help apply pressure early on, while cards like Searing Blaze and Shard Volley can clear the way for attacks. The inclusion of black mana sources like Blood Crypt and Deathrite Shaman allow for versatility in casting spells like Rakdos Charm and Anathemancer, adding extra reach and disruption to the deck's game plan."
