With access to strong ramp and card draw, the deck can combo off quickly and overwhelm the opponent with a large board presence and powerful creatures."

The goal is to assemble the necessary pieces to either activate Goblin Charbelcher's ability to deal damage directly to the opponent or use Burning Wish to search for a game-winning card from the sideboard. Timing and sequencing are key to success with this high-risk, high-reward strategy."
