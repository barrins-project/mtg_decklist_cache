It aims to maintain board control with cards like Supreme Verdict and Detention Sphere while generating card advantage through Forbidden Alchemy and Jace, Architect of Thought. The deck also has ways to deal with specific threats, such as Terminus against aggro decks and Sever the Bloodline for creature-heavy strategies. Finally, it has a win condition in the form of Sphinx's Revelation and Lingering Souls to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted."
