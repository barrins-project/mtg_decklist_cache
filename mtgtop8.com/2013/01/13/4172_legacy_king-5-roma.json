It utilizes cards like Burning Wish and Past in Flames to find key pieces of the combo or to recur spells from the graveyard."

The deck can also generate card advantage and manipulate the top of the library with cards like Sensei's Divining Top and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, ultimately leading to a win condition with Entreat the Angels or Batterskull."

            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly fill up your graveyard with Dredge cards such as Golgari Thug and Stinkweed Imp, allowing you to bring back powerful creatures like Golgari Grave-Troll and Ichorid. By using cards like Careful Study and Faithless Looting to discard cards and trigger Dredge abilities, you can overwhelm your opponent with a swarm of creatures and trigger Bridge from Below for extra value. The deck utilizes a combination of graveyard synergy and burst potential to defeat your opponent in a quick and efficient manner."
