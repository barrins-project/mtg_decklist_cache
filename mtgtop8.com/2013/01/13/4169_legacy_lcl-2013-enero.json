By utilizing cards like Aether Vial and Daze for mana efficiency and disruption, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and tempo plays. Cards like Silvergill Adept and Standstill provide card advantage, while Wasteland helps control the opponent's mana base. Overall, the deck is designed to apply pressure early and maintain board control throughout the game."
