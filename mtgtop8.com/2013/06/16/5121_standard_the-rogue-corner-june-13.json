It includes a mix of human knights and angels, with cards such as Champion of the Parish, Silverblade Paladin, and Sublime Archangel to build up a strong board presence. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben disrupts the opponent's spells, while Boros Reckoner provides a solid defense. Ajani, Caller of the Pride offers additional support with his abilities. The deck aims to win through fast and relentless attacks, making it a formidable force in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
