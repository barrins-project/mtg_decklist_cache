The deck aims to quickly ramp up mana with cards like Farseek and Arbor Elf, allowing for early drops of powerful creatures like Voice of Resurgence and Thragtusk. Restoration Angel and Prime Speaker Zegana provide additional creature synergy and card advantage. The deck also includes counterspells and removal options like Selesnya Charm and Sphinx's Revelation for added control. Overall, the key concept is to maintain a strong board presence while controlling the game state."
