By efficiently handling threats and generating card advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Sphinx's Revelation, the deck aims to stall the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with powerful finishers like Sorin, Lord of Innistrad and Lingering Souls. The deck's mana base is optimized for casting spells with ease, allowing for smooth gameplay and maximizing the effectiveness of its control elements."
