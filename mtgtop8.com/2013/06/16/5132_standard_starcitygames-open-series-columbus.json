By playing cards like Champion of the Parish and Mayor of Avabruck early on, the deck aims to build a strong board presence and swing for lethal damage. Cards like Boros Elite and Lightning Mauler help maintain pressure on the opponent, while Ghor-Clan Rampager can provide additional reach for closing out games. The mana base is optimized to consistently cast the deck's spells without any color issues."
