The mana base is designed to support the deck's multi-colored spells and provide flexibility in casting both early and late-game threats. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Garruk, Primal Hunter adds additional utility and win conditions. The overall strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan, stabilize the board, and eventually overwhelm them with powerful threats."
