It combines disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach with powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf and Bloodbraid Elf. The deck also includes powerful removal spells like Punishing Fire and Abrupt Decay to deal with opposing threats. The goal is to control the game early on with disruption and removal, and then close out the game with efficient threats and card advantage from cards like Dark Confidant and Liliana of the Veil."
