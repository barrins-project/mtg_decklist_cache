            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively play creatures and burn spells to quickly overwhelm the opponent. By utilizing powerful creatures like Thundermaw Hellkite, Gyre Sage, and Falkenrath Aristocrat, along with burn spells like Bonfire of the Damned and Ghor-Clan Rampager, the deck aims to apply pressure from the early game and maintain tempo throughout the match. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy with a mix of lands that provide various colors of mana and enable efficient spell casting."
