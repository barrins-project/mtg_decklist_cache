By using cards like Unburial Rites to bring back impactful creatures like Angel of Serenity or Acidic Slime, the deck aims to control the board while generating value. Additionally, the deck includes mana acceleration cards like Arbor Elf and Avacyn's Pilgrim to ramp into its higher-cost threats, allowing for explosive plays. Overall, the deck focuses on generating value through repeated reanimation and powerful creature abilities to dominate the battlefield."
