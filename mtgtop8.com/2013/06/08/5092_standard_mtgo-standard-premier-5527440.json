The deck also includes versatile cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, Architect of Thought to provide additional value and flexibility in different situations. Ultimately, the key strategy is to control the game until the opponent runs out of resources and win through card advantage and powerful threats."

By enchanting them with auras like Unflinching Courage and Rancor, as well as providing protection with cards like Simic Charm, the deck aims to deal large amounts of damage quickly while keeping the creatures safe from removal spells. The deck also includes mana ramp in the form of Avacyn's Pilgrim to help with casting the higher cost creatures and spells. Overall, the focus is on creating a fast, hard-hitting aggro strategy with resilient creatures."
