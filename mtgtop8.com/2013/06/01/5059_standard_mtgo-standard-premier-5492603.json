By sacrificing creatures like Doomed Traveler and Lingering Souls to trigger abilities and deal damage, the deck can overwhelm opponents quickly. Cards like Skirsdag High Priest and Blasphemous Act provide additional ways to clear the board or create powerful tokens. The deck also includes disruption with cards like Sin Collector and removal spells like Tragic Slip."
