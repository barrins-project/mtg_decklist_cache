The deck also includes powerful finishers like Hellrider and Falkenrath Aristocrat to close out the game quickly. The combination of aggressive creatures, sacrifice effects, and powerful finishers creates a fast-paced and hard-hitting strategy that aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can set up their own game plan."
