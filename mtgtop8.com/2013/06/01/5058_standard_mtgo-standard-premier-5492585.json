By utilizing cards like Warleader's Helix and Searing Spear for direct damage, along with counter spells like Syncopate and Dissipate for defense, the deck aims to maintain board control while deploying powerful threats like Aetherling and Restoration Angel to quickly close out the game. The inclusion of card draw spells like Think Twice and Sphinx's Revelation helps to maintain card advantage and ensure consistency in gameplay."
