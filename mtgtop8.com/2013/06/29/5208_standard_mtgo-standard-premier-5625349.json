            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and cheap burn spells in order to deal damage quickly and efficiently. By utilizing low-cost creatures with powerful abilities and a mix of direct damage spells, the deck aims to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent until they are out of resources or defeated. The mana base is built to support the aggressive nature of the deck, allowing for consistent drops of creatures and spells to keep the pressure on the opponent."
