By combining reanimation spells like Unburial Rites with cards that fill the graveyard like Mulch and Grisly Salvage, the deck can gain a tempo advantage and overwhelm opponents with its large threats. Additionally, cards like Restoration Angel and Fiend Hunter provide additional value by synergizing with the reanimation strategy. The deck aims to assemble its combo pieces efficiently and close out games with its high-impact threats."
