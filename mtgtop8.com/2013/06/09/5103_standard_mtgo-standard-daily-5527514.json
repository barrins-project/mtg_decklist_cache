The inclusion of burn spells like Pillar of Flame and Searing Spear provides additional reach and removal options. This deck aims to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react, ultimately leading to a swift victory."

The deck focuses on quickly building a board presence with cards like Stromkirk Noble, Legion Loyalist, and Burning-Tree Emissary, while also using cards like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame to control the opponent's board. With powerful finishers like Hellrider and Boros Reckoner, the deck aims to deal quick and consistent damage to the opponent while maintaining pressure throughout the game."
