The deck combines powerful removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile with counterspells like Mana Leak and Spell Snare to control the board. Midrange threats such as Geist of Saint Traft and Snapcaster Mage provide a clock for the opponent to deal with, while cards like Restoration Angel and Baneslayer Angel offer additional value and protection. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize the potential of Celestial Colonnade as a win condition."
