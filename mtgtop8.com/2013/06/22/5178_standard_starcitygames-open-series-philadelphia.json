The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, Architect of Thought and Tamiyo, the Moon Sage to further control the board and provide card advantage. The win condition is typically through milling the opponent with Nephalia Drownyard or through a slow attrition with powerful threats like Jace, Memory Adept and Sorin, Lord of Innistrad."
