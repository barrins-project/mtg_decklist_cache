This is supplemented by burn spells like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame to clear the way and deal direct damage to the opponent. The deck also has some versatile removal options like Selesnya Charm and Mizzium Mortars. With a solid mana base of dual lands, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent and secure victory before they can stabilize."
