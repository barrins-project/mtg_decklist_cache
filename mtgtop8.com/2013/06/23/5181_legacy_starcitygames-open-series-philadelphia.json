The main win conditions are Griselbrand for card advantage and life gain, Elesh Norn for board clear, and Iona to shut down opponents' strategies. The deck also includes counterspells like Force of Will for protection."

The main goal is to storm off and create a massive amount of goblin tokens with Empty the Warrens, overwhelming the opponent and securing a win. Cards like Duress and Cabal Therapy help to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Burning Wish allows for additional flexibility in accessing the sideboard for key cards. The deck relies on careful sequencing and efficient use of resources to execute its combo efficiently and effectively."

By playing cards like Shardless Agent and Bloodbraid Elf, the deck aims to generate card advantage and create a constant stream of threats. The mana base is designed to provide a good mix of colors for the spells in the deck, while also having some land destruction with Wasteland. Overall, this deck is built to be aggressive and disruptive in the Legacy format."
