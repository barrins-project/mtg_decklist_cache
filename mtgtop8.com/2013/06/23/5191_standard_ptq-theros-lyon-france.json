By using a combination of mana acceleration and reanimation spells, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures like Thragtusk, Angel of Serenity, and Craterhoof Behemoth. The inclusion of cards like Acidic Slime and Fiend Hunter helps control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck's goal is to create explosive plays and win the game through a powerful combo of reanimation and big creature threats."
