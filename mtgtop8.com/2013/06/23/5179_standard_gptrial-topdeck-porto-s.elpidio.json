By sacrificing creatures such as Doomed Traveler and Young Wolf, players can trigger effects like Blood Artist and Skirsdag High Priest to drain the opponent's life points while maintaining an aggressive assault with Tokens from cards like Lingering Souls. Varolz, the Scar-Striped can also provide additional value by scavenging creatures from the graveyard. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggro and sacrifice synergies."
