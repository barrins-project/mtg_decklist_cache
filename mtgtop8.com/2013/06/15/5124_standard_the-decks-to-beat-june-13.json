The combination of graveyard filling cards like Grisly Salvage and Mulch, alongside creature removal like Abrupt Decay and Sever the Bloodline, allows the deck to effectively control the game and set up its powerful combo plays."

Cards like Champion of the Parish, Experiment One, and Mayor of Avabruck grow stronger with each creature played, while cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Lightning Mauler allow for explosive starts. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben helps to disrupt the opponent's spells, while Searing Spear provides removal and reach for the final points of damage. Overall, this deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain that pressure throughout the game."
