It aims to establish a lock on the game by using cards like Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top to control the top of the opponent's library. The win condition of the deck is to either deck the opponent using Helm of Obedience or overwhelm them with angel tokens generated by Entreat the Angels. The deck is designed to outlast and outmaneuver opponents through careful card manipulation and strategic plays."
