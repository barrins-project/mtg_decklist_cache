The key strategy involves using cards like Blood Artist and Cartel Aristocrat to gain value from sacrificing creatures, while cards like Boros Reckoner and Falkenrath Aristocrat provide aggressive threats on the board. Skirsdag High Priest and Lingering Souls offer additional ways to generate tokens and maintain pressure. The deck also includes removal spells like Tragic Slip and Blasphemous Act to control the board and Orzhov Charm for utility. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and sacrificing creatures."
