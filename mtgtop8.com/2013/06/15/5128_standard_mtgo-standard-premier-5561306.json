This allows the player to overwhelm their opponent with hasty reanimated creatures and powerful combos. The inclusion of mana ramp creatures like Avacyn's Pilgrim and Arbor Elf helps to accelerate the deck's game plan, while cards like Thragtusk provide additional value and resilience. Overall, the deck aims to efficiently reanimate creatures and dominate the battlefield."
