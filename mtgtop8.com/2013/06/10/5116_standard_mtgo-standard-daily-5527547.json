By using cards like Unburial Rites and Grisly Salvage to fill the graveyard and reanimate creatures like Angel of Serenity or Thragtusk, the deck can quickly establish a dominant board presence. Support cards like Abrupt Decay and Restoration Angel help control the game while setting up for the game-winning reanimation combos. The deck's mana base is also carefully crafted to support the consistency of the combo strategy."

The key strategy is to use sacrifice effects, such as Cartel Aristocrat and Blasphemous Act, to trigger Blood Artist's ability and drain the opponent's life total quickly. Lingering Souls provides additional value with multiple bodies, while Sorin, Lord of Innistrad can create more creatures or buff existing ones for a final push to victory."
