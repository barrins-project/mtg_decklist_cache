By filling the graveyard with cards like Mulch and Grisly Salvage, the player can reanimate creatures such as Thragtusk and Angel of Serenity with Unburial Rites. The deck also utilizes ramp with Avacyn's Pilgrim and Arbor Elf to quickly get out big threats like Craterhoof Behemoth. Lingering Souls provides additional value and Garruk Relentless can help control the board. Overall, the strategy revolves around quickly filling the graveyard and bringing back powerful creatures to dominate the game."
