By utilizing powerful cards like Boros Reckoner, Restoration Angel, and Thundermaw Hellkite, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on and maintain control of the game. Domri Rade and Mizzium Mortars provide additional support and removal options, while cards like Voice of Resurgence and Loxodon Smiter help create a strong board presence. The mana base and creature selection in the deck enable consistent aggression and flexibility in gameplay."
