The combination of powerful creatures like Angel of Serenity, Blood Baron of Vizkopa, and Thragtusk, along with removal and ramp spells, creates a strong reanimator strategy that overwhelms opponents. The inclusion of cards like Garruk Relentless and Restoration Angel provides additional utility and synergy with the deck's main strategy. The goal is to outvalue opponents by efficiently reanimating powerful creatures and controlling the board."

It also includes card draw and lifegain to maintain resources and stay ahead in the late game. The deck aims to control the tempo of the game and grind out advantages over time, ultimately winning through powerful late-game threats like Aetherling. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's diverse color requirements and ensure consistent access to the necessary resources."
