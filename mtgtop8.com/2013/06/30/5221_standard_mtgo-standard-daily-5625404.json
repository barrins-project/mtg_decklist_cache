The key strategy is to bring back game-winning creatures like Thragtusk, Angel of Serenity, and Craterhoof Behemoth to overwhelm the opponent. Cards like Arbor Elf and Avacyn's Pilgrim help ramp up mana for faster plays, while Fiend Hunter and Restoration Angel provide additional utility and protection. The deck aims to create explosive turns by combining reanimation with powerful creatures, ultimately securing victory through overwhelming board presence and combo potential."
