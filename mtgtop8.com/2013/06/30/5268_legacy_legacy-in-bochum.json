Cabal Therapy is used to disrupt the opponent's strategy while Faithless Looting and Careful Study help dig for combo pieces. The deck also includes cards like Lion's Eye Diamond and Firestorm for additional combo potential. The overall goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy that relies on graveyard recursion and synergy."
