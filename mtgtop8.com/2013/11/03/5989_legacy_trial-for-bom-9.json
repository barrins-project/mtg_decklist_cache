The mana base is built to support both green and blue spells, with Deathrite Shaman providing additional flexibility. The deck's goal is to control the game tempo and win through aggression and disruption."

The deck also utilizes powerful equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte to further enhance its aggressive game plan. The strong mana base with fetch lands and dual lands allows for consistent mana development, while cards like Brainstorm and Ponder provide card selection and deck manipulation. The inclusion of versatile removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Lightning Bolt further enhances the deck's ability to control the game."
