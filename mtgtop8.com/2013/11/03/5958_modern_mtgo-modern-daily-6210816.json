The powerful combination of fast creatures like Goblin Guide and Tarmogoyf, backed up by pump spells like Ghor-Clan Rampager and Rancor, allows for quick and explosive starts to put pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to close out the game quickly through consistent damage and efficient removal, while also utilizing cards like Burning-Tree Emissary for additional mana acceleration and explosive turns."
