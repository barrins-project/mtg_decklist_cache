The deck also includes card draw and lifegain to maintain resources and stay ahead in the game. The win condition is to eventually resolve powerful threats like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Aetherling to close out the game. Overall, the key strategy is to control the game through disruption and removal until the deck's powerful finishers can take over."
