            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and to fully utilize the devotion to black mechanic. By playing powerful black cards such as Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Desecration Demon, combined with cards like Underworld Connections and Whip of Erebos to maintain card advantage and gain life, the deck aims to control the game while dealing consistent damage. The inclusion of cards like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall allows for disruption of the opponent's strategy, while Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Temple of Silence provide additional mana acceleration and fixing."

The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent casting of spells."
