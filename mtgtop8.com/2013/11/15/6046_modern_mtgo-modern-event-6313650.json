The goal is to cast a massive Genesis Wave to put powerful creatures and enchantments directly onto the battlefield, potentially winning the game in a single turn. Cloudstone Curio and Eternal Witness provide added value by allowing for recursion of key cards. With a focus on explosive plays and overwhelming the opponent with big threats, this deck looks to quickly establish dominance and close out the game."

The deck focuses on toolboxing through various creatures such as Kitchen Finks, Murderous Redcap, and Melira, Sylvok Outcast to create powerful synergies and threaten the opponent. The creatures not only provide value on their own but also work together to create an unstoppable advantage. Additionally, the deck includes disruption cards like Abrupt Decay and Voice of Resurgence to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building towards the combo finish."
