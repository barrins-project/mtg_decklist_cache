            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by denying the opponent's spells with counterspells like Mana Leak and Mindbreak Trap, while also having removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Pillar of Flame to deal with threats. The Faeries synergy provides an evasive threat in the form of Spellstutter Sprite and Vendilion Clique, while also utilizing Delver of Secrets for card advantage. The deck aims to tempo the opponent by disrupting their game plan and keeping the board under control, ultimately setting up for a win through chip damage with faeries and burn spells."
