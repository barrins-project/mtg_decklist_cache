The deck aims to ramp up quickly to cast powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn. It also includes plenty of removal and disruption to handle opposing threats, along with card selection tools like Sylvan Scrying and Ancient Stirrings to find key pieces of the combo. Overall, the deck focuses on resource management and efficient threat deployment to dominate the game."
