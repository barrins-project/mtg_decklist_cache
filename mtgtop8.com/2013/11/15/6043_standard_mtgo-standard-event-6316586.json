The key strategy is to use cards like Cloudfin Raptor and Judge's Familiar to establish an early board presence, while cards like Thassa, God of the Sea and Master of Waves provide additional value and resilience. The use of counterspells and bounce effects like Cyclonic Rift allows the deck to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain tempo. Overall, this deck aims to close out games quickly through efficient beatdown strategies."
