Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain control of the game until victory is achieved."

The inclusion of creatures like Boros Reckoner and Chandra's Phoenix provide additional reach and staying power in case the game goes longer. With a high density of cheap removal and creatures, this deck is designed to be fast and relentless in its aggression."
