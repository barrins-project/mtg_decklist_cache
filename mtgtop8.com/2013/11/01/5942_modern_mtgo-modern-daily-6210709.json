The inclusion of efficient creatures like Vault Skirge and Signal Pest, along with key disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Spell Pierce, help to maintain pressure and disrupt opposing game plans. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the artifact-heavy theme of the deck."

The deck also features control elements like counterspells and removal to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Card advantage is generated through cantrips like Serum Visions and Peek, as well as Snapcaster Mage. The mana base is built to support the combo while also providing flexibility with fetch lands and utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Desolate Lighthouse."
