Additionally, cards like Pyroclasm and Oblivion Stone provide board control, while Relic of Progenitus disrupts opponent's graveyard strategies. Overall, the deck aims to establish control of the game through powerful plays and efficient mana production."

The deck also includes control elements like Remand, Cryptic Command, and Lightning Bolt to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own combo. Overall, the key strategy revolves around effectively ramping, controlling the game, and then executing a game-winning Scapeshift combo."
