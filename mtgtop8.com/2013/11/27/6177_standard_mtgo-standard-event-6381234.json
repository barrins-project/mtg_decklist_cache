The deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, Architect of Thought and Elspeth, Sun's Champion, along with versatile cards like Azorius Charm and Detention Sphere to control the pace of the game. The deck also includes lifegain and card draw mechanics with cards like Sphinx's Revelation to out-value opponents in the late game. The win condition usually involves resolving threats like Blood Baron of Vizkopa to close out the game."
