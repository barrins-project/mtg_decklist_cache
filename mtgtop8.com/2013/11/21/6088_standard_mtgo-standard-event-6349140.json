It aims to control the game with counterspells like Cyclonic Rift and card draw with Jace, Architect of Thought. Garruk, Caller of Beasts helps to search for more creatures to play. Aetherling serves as a finisher to close out games. The deck utilizes lands like Temple of Mystery and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx to maximize mana production while maintaining a good balance of islands and forests."
