The key strategy is to protect key threats like Prime Speaker Zegana and Aetherling, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with powerful creatures like Polukranos, World Eater and Prophet of Kruphix. The deck also has a strong mid to late game presence with cards like Primeval Bounty and Master Biomancer."
