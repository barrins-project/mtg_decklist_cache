The deck includes various ways to find the combo pieces, protect them with counter spells like Remand and Cryptic Command, and disrupt opponents with cards like Peek and Vendilion Clique. It also includes removal and burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Grim Lavamancer to control the board. The mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility, allowing for a fast and efficient win condition."

By doing so, the deck can continuously bring back creatures from the graveyard and create a powerful board presence. Additionally, cards like Lotleth Troll and Tymaret, the Murder King support this strategy by sacrificing creatures for additional benefits. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Abrupt Decay to handle opponent threats."
