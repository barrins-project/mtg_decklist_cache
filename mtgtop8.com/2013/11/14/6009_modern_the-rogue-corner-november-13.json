By using cards like Temporal Mastery, Time Warp, and Walk the Aeons, the player can repeatedly take multiple turns in a row while also using Howling Mine to draw extra cards. The goal is to set up a lock on the opponent by constantly having more resources and opportunities to make plays, ultimately leading to victory through overwhelming advantage."
