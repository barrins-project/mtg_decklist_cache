The deck also includes cards like Assemble the Legion to generate a steady stream of token creatures and Warleader's Helix for additional removal and life gain. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistent access to both white and red mana sources. Ultimately, the goal is to effectively manage threats while establishing a strong board presence to outlast the opponent."
