            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly and aggressively reduce your own life total in order to power up Death's Shadow, a powerful threat that gets stronger as your life total decreases. This deck aims to disrupt your opponent's game plan with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach, while also maintaining control with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze. Baleful Strix provides card advantage and Delver of Secrets provides another efficient threat. The deck aims to finish the game quickly with powerful creatures and control elements."
