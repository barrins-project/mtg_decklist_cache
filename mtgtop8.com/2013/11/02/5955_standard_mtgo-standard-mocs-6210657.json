By utilizing low-cost creatures like Ash Zealot, Boros Reckoner, and Rakdos Cackler, along with burn spells like Lightning Strike and Magma Jet, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Cards like Chandra's Phoenix and Fanatic of Mogis provide additional damage and pressure. The inclusion of cards like Chained to the Rocks and Hammer of Purphoros help control the board and provide additional value. The deck's mana base is set up to support its aggressive game plan with consistent access to red and white mana sources."
