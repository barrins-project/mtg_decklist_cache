The key strategy is to maintain board control and tempo by countering important spells and removing threats, while slowly chipping away at the opponent's life total with evasive creatures. The inclusion of equipment such as Sword of Fire and Ice enhances the Faeries' effectiveness in combat and provides card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to outmaneuver and outlast the opponent in a game of attrition."
