The inclusion of cards like Ranger of Eos and Squadron Hawk provides card advantage and consistency, while Chalice of Life offers an alternate win condition. With powerful creatures like Serra Ascendant and Ajani's Pridemate, this deck can quickly close out games by overwhelming opponents with its life gain strategy."

Additionally, the deck includes mana fixing and graveyard interaction through cards like Deathrite Shaman and Grim Lavamancer to ensure consistency and versatility in its aggressive strategy."
