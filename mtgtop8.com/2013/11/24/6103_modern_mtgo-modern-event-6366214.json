The deck includes control elements like Remand and Cryptic Command to protect the combo, as well as card draw and filtering spells like Serum Visions and Peek to find combo pieces quickly. Lightning Bolt and Grim Lavamancer provide additional removal and pressure, while Snapcaster Mage offers recursion and flexibility. The mana base is designed to support the combo while providing enough colored sources for the spells in the deck."

By utilizing cards like Gitaxian Probe, Manamorphose, and Goblin Electromancer, the deck aims to ramp up mana production and trigger Pyromancer Ascension to double spell effects. The end goal is to cast a lethal Grapeshot or Past in Flames to finish off the opponent in one explosive turn. The deck relies on careful sequencing and precise card selection to maximize its combo potential."

By playing efficient creatures like Ornithopter and Signal Pest alongside powerful equipment like Cranial Plating, the deck can deal large amounts of damage early in the game. With the ability to pump up creatures with Steel Overseer and Arcbound Ravager, as well as having evasion with Inkmoth Nexus, the deck aims to close out games before the opponent can stabilize. It also includes card draw spells like Thoughtcast to maintain card advantage while deploying threats."
