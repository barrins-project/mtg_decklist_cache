It looks to equip Cranial Plating onto creatures like Vault Skirge and Etched Champion to maximize damage output. Steel Overseer boosts the power of all creatures on the board, while Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum help ramp up mana. Arcbound Ravager can be sacrificed to move counters around, making it a versatile threat. The deck also includes evasion with flyers like Signal Pest and Inkmoth Nexus."

This deck includes cards that can disrupt the opponent's strategy, such as Thoughtseize and Spell Pierce, as well as key cards like Cranial Plating to boost the power of creatures like Vault Skirge and Etched Champion. The deck also includes cards like Steel Overseer and Arcbound Ravager to further enhance the strength of the artifact creatures. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy and enable the use of powerful lands like Inkmoth Nexus and Blinkmoth Nexus."
