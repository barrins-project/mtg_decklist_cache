The deck utilizes powerful black cards such as Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Pack Rat to build up board presence and generate card advantage. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Erebos, God of the Dead and Whip of Erebos to provide additional value and resilience. This deck aims to exert constant pressure on the opponent and close out games quickly."
