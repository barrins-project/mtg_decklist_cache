Thassa, God of the Sea provides additional card draw and unblockable attackers, while Tidebinder Mage and Domestication help control the opponent's board. The deck can also use Bident of Thassa and Cyclonic Rift for additional card advantage and disruption, allowing for a fast and aggressive playstyle."

The deck also includes powerful creatures like Stormbreath Dragon and Boros Reckoner to pressure the opponent. The mana base is streamlined with a mix of lands that can produce both red and white mana efficiently. The overall strategy is to control the game until you can overwhelm your opponent with a combination of removal spells and aggressive creatures."
