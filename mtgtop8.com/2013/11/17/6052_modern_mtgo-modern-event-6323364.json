This allows the player to cast powerful spells such as Mindslaver, Wurmcoil Engine, and Platinum Angel to control the game and outlast opponents. The deck also includes various counterspells and bounce spells like Repeal and Remand to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, cards like Treasure Mage and Expedition Map help to search for key cards and maintain card advantage."
