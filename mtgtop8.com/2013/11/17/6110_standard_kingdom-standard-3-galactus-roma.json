It also includes efficient removal like Polukranos, World Eater and control elements like Domri Rade to handle opposing threats. The goal is to overwhelm opponents with big creatures and maintain board control through a combination of ramp and removal, ultimately out-valuing them in the late game with powerful spells and creatures."
