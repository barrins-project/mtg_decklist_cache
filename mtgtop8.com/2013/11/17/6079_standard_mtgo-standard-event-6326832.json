By utilizing the power of Mono Blue cards and mana acceleration from Nykthos and Mutavault, the deck aims to swarm the board early on with creatures like Cloudfin Raptor, Frostburn Weird, and Nightveil Specter. Thassa, God of the Sea provides extra card advantage and evasion, while Tidebinder Mage helps control the opponent's board. The deck also includes some card draw and control options like Cyclonic Rift and Jace, Architect of Thought to maintain momentum and disrupt the opponent's strategy."
