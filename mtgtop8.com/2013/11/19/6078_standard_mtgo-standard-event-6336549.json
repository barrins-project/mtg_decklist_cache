By being able to quickly flood the board with creatures like Cloudfin Raptor and Master of Waves, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast tempo and evasive threats. Thassa, God of the Sea provides additional card selection and evasion, while cards like Tidebinder Mage and Cyclonic Rift help to control the opponent's board. Overall, the deck aims to win through early aggression and maintaining board presence."
