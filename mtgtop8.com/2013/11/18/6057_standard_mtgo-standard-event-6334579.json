It utilizes cards like Young Pyromancer and Chandra, Pyromaster to generate tokens and card advantage, while also having efficient removal in Shock, Magma Jet, and Lightning Strike. The deck aims to apply pressure early on with creatures like Rakdos Cackler and Firedrinker Satyr, and finish the game with burn spells and evasive threats like Chandra's Phoenix. The inclusion of Sacred Foundry and Temple of Triumph ensures consistent mana availability for casting spells on curve."
