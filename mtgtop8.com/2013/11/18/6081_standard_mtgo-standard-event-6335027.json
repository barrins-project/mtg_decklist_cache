Mutavault provides additional creature threats while cards like Tidebinder Mage and Frostburn Weird disrupt opponent's strategy. Jace, Architect of Thought and Bident of Thassa offer card advantage and Cyclonic Rift provides a board wipe option. Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx can generate a lot of mana for big plays. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly with a strong proactive game plan."
