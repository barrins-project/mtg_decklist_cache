The land base is optimized for fast mana production and includes utility lands like Inkmoth Nexus and Blinkmoth Nexus.

The deck also includes control elements like Pyroclasm, Oblivion Stone, Karn Liberated, and Relic of Progenitus to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to control the game through powerful spells and overwhelming threats, ultimately overpowering the opponent through superior board presence and mana advantage."
