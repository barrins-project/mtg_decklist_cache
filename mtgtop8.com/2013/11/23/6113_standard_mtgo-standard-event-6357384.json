The deck aims to end the game quickly through constant pressure and direct damage, utilizing Rakdos's signature aggressive playstyle and burn-based removal to control the board and secure victory in the early game. The deck also incorporates a bit of resilience with Whip of Erebos and Chandra, Pyromaster to help maintain board presence and turn the tides in your favor."
