By utilizing aggressive creatures like Burning-Tree Emissary and Boros Reckoner, alongside powerful enchantments like Hammer of Purphoros and Chained to the Rocks, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with early pressure and finish them off with direct damage from cards like Stormbreath Dragon and Fanatic of Mogis. The deck's mana base includes Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx to generate massive amounts of red mana, allowing for explosive plays."
