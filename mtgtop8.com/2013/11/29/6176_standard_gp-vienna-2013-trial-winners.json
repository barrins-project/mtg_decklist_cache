By utilizing low-cost creatures like Rakdos Cackler and Burning-Tree Emissary, combined with powerful enchantments like Madcap Skills and efficient burn spells like Lightning Strike and Magma Jet, the goal is to deal damage to the opponent as quickly as possible before they can set up their own game plan. Chandra's Phoenix and Boros Reckoner provide additional sources of damage and resilience to removal spells, ensuring a consistent stream of pressure."
