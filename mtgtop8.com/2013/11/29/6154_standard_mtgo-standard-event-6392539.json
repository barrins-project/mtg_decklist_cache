By utilizing cards like Polukranos, World Eater, Lotleth Troll, and Dreg Mangler, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on. Supporting these creatures are cards like Boon Satyr, Thoughtseize, and Hero's Downfall for additional control and removal. Varolz, the Scar-Striped and Scavenging Ooze provide graveyard interaction, while Reaper of the Wilds offers a resilient threat. The deck is designed to apply constant pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
