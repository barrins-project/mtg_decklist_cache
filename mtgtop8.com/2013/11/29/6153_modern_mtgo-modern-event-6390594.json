            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly ramp up mana using cards like Summer Bloom and Amulet of Vigor, allowing you to play Primeval Titan or Hive Mind earlier than expected. With the combination of Hive Mind and Pact cards, you can force your opponent to also cast the same spells, potentially leading to their defeat. The deck also includes utility lands like Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion and Inkmoth Nexus to give your creatures additional abilities or evasion. Overall, the deck aims to assemble its combo pieces efficiently to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."

This allows for the casting of high-cost spells such as Karn Liberated and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn. The deck also includes various ways to search for and manipulate the UrzaTron lands, along with board wipes and graveyard hate to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The end goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats and efficient control elements."
