By flooding the board with multiple creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Thassa, God of the Sea and Bident of Thassa provide additional card advantage and utility to maintain pressure on the opponent. The deck also contains disruption cards like Tidebinder Mage and Judge's Familiar to control the board and protect its aggressive strategy."
