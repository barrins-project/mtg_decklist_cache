            "notes": "The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with the Urza lands (Tower, Power Plant, Mine) to cast powerful threats like Karn Liberated and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn. It also includes cards like All Is Dust and Oblivion Stone to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck includes ways to search for key lands with cards like Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying, while also including protection with Spellskite and disruption with Ghost Quarter. The key idea is to assemble UrzaTron, control the board, and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
