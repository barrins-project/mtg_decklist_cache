The synergy between creatures like Reaper of the Wilds and Varolz, the Scar-Striped, as well as graveyard interaction with cards like Scavenging Ooze, allows for powerful plays and maintains pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats and disrupt their game plan with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize."
