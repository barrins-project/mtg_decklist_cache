By leveraging cards such as Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, the deck aims to equip Cranial Plating onto evasive creatures like Vault Skirge and Inkmoth Nexus to deal lethal damage to the opponent. Steel Overseer pumps up the team of artifact creatures, while Arcbound Ravager and Etched Champion provide additional threats and protection. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and tight synergy between artifacts and creatures."
