By utilizing cards like Tidebinder Mage to control the opponent's creatures and Master of Waves to create elemental tokens, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with an aggressive strategy. Additional cards like Nightveil Specter and Judge's Familiar provide disruption and card advantage, while cards like Cyclonic Rift offer tempo swings. The deck aims to close out games quickly by leveraging its synergistic creature base and control elements."
