By utilizing cards like Nimble Mongoose, Tarmogoyf, and Delver of Secrets, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain tempo throughout the game. The mixture of counterspells and disruptive cards such as Wasteland and Stifle helps to keep the opponent from stabilizing or mounting a defense. The deck's goal is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with threats while preventing them from executing their game plan effectively."
