By utilizing cards like Lion's Eye Diamond and Lotus Petal, the player can accelerate their mana production to fuel cards like Dark Ritual and Cabal Ritual, allowing them to draw through their deck with cards like Brainstorm and Ponder. The purpose of this deck is to assemble a lethal storm count and finish off the opponent with Tendrils of Agony or generate value with Past in Flames."
