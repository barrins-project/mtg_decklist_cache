It aims to stabilize the game with board wipes like Supreme Verdict and finish off opponents with powerful threats like Aetherling and Elspeth, Sun's Champion. The deck's key strategy is to outvalue opponents by efficiently answering threats and drawing into more answers or win conditions. By managing resources and responding effectively to opponent's plays, the deck aims to control the game and secure victory."
