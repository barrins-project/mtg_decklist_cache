The deck also includes cards like Cabal Therapy and Thoughtseize for disruption, while Lingering Souls provides additional threats and chump blockers. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of creatures, sacrificing them to Goblin Bombardment for additional damage. The deck aims to control the game through disruption and aggressive plays, ultimately leading to a quick victory."
