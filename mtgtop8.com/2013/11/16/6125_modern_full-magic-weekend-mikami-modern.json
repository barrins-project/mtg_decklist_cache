The deck includes control elements like counterspells and removal spells to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. It also includes card draw and card selection spells to find the combo pieces more easily. The deck is designed to quickly assemble the combo and win the game before the opponent can effectively respond."
