Overall, the deck aims to slow down the game and outvalue the opponent through control and card advantage."

The inclusion of cards like Rapid Hybridization and Cyclonic Rift provide removal options while Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx helps ramp up mana production for bigger threats. With a focus on tempo and pressure, this deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents in a fast-paced 1 vs 1 Standard format."
