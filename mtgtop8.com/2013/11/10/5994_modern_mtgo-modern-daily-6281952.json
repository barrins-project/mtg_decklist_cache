It utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Lingering Souls to control the board while deploying threats like Tarmogoyf and Desecration Demon to quickly close out the game. The deck also includes cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's game plan and give the deck a strategic advantage. Overall, the deck aims to win through a combination of aggression and disruption."
