By using cards like Thoughtseize, Hymn to Tourach, and Diabolic Edict to disrupt the opponent's hand and board state, while also having efficient threats like Tarmogoyf and Shardless Agent, this deck aims to control the game and come out on top. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana of the Veil further solidifies its control over the game."
