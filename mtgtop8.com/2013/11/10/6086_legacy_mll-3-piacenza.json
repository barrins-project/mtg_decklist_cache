Cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Entreat the Angels provide powerful win conditions, while cards like Brainstorm and Sensei's Divining Top help with card selection and manipulation. The deck also includes a Counterbalance package to help control the opponent's spells. Overall, the strategy is to out-value and out-maneuver the opponent."

It aims to generate card advantage through Ancestral Vision and Shardless Agent, while maintaining a strong tempo with efficient threats like Tarmogoyf and Deathrite Shaman. The deck is designed to have a versatile game plan, able to grind out longer games with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Pernicious Deed, or quickly close out games with aggressive creatures. The mana base is set up to support the multi-color nature of the deck and provide consistent access to all required colors."
