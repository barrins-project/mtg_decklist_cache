By playing a variety of creatures with flying, unblockable, and tap-down abilities, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent. Thassa, God of the Sea is a central piece of the strategy, providing card selection and making creatures unblockable once devotion is high enough. The inclusion of Mutavault and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx adds versatility to the mana base, while spells like Cyclonic Rift and Domestication offer additional control options to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
