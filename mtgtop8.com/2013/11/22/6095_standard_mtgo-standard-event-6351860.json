With a mix of powerful creatures and removal spells, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. Additionally, the inclusion of Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx allows for explosive turns where a large amount of mana can be generated to cast multiple spells in a single turn."
