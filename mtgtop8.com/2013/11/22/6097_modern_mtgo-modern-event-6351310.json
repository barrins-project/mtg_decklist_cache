The deck aims to control the game through mana advantage and powerful threats."

The deck also includes multiple ways to search for these Tron lands, along with interaction in the form of removal like Pyroclasm and Oblivion Stone. Relic of Progenitus provides graveyard hate, while Grove of the Burnwillows helps with life gain. The goal is to control the game with powerful threats and disruption until victory is achieved."
