Cards like Blood Artist and bloodthrone vampire provide additional value when other creatures die, while cards like Knight of Infamy and Falkenrath Aristocrat offer strong offensive threats. Tragic Slip and Doom Blade are included to deal with opposing threats, while Cavern of Souls ensures that important creatures like Geralf's Messenger can't be countered. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and life-draining effects."
