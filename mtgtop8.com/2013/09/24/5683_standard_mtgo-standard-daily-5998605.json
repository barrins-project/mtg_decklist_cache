Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption, while Lifebane Zombie helps with hand disruption. The deck also includes cards to gain life and generate card advantage, such as Sign in Blood, Disciple of Bolas, and Vampire Nighthawk. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and control the game."
