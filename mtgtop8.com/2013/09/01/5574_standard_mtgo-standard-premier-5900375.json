The deck's strength lies in its ability to apply pressure early with aggressive creatures, while also having resilience and card advantage with cards like Voice of Resurgence and Disciple of Bolas. Overall, it aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient creatures and versatile removal spells."
