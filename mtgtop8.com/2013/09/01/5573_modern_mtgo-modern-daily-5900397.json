The deck also includes ways to tutor for key cards with Treasure Mage and Expedition Map, as well as utility with cards like Karn Liberated and Mindslaver. Ultimately, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents through a combination of control and powerful threats."

It also includes cards like Karn Liberated and Oblivion Stone for control and removal, as well as utility cards like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to search for key lands. The deck has a finisher in the form of Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Wurmcoil Engine for additional threats. Overall, the key strategy is to control the game early on and overpower the opponent with big threats later in the game."
