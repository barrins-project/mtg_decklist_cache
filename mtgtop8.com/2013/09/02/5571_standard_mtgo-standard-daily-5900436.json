With a strong mana ramp strategy using cards like Elvish Mystic and Arbor Elf, the deck aims to play powerful threats such as Wolfir Silverheart and Vorapede early in the game. With support from planeswalkers like Garruk, Caller of Beasts and Garruk Relentless, as well as the finishing power of Craterhoof Behemoth, the deck can quickly close out games. Utilizing the synergy between creatures and boosting them with Gavony Township ensures a strong board presence and consistent pressure on the opponent."
