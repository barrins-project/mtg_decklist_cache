By utilizing cards like Burning-Tree Emissary, Firefist Striker, and Rakdos Cackler to put pressure on the opponent early game, followed by creatures like Hellrider and Chandra's Phoenix to finish the game off. The burn spells like Pillar of Flame, Searing Spear, and Shock can also be used to clear the opponent's board and ensure a clear path for damage. The deck aims to win the game as fast as possible."
