It also utilizes cards like Expedition Map, Sylvan Scrying, and Ancient Stirrings to find key pieces of the combo. In addition, it runs disruption in the form of Pyroclasm and Oblivion Stone to control the board. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats while controlling the game with efficient removal and land searching."
