Thragtusk, Scavenging Ooze, and Huntmaster of the Fells provide resiliency and value, while cards like Tragic Slip, Rakdos's Return, and Liliana of the Veil help to remove threats and disrupt the opponent's hand. The deck also includes powerful removal spells like Putrefy, Dreadbore, and Bonfire of the Damned to deal with a variety of threats. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistency in casting spells."
