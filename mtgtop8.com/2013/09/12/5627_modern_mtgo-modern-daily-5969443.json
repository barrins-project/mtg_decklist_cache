By maximizing the number of auras and protection spells in the deck, it aims to create an unblockable, highly-attacking creature that can deal damage swiftly and efficiently. The strategy is to establish board presence early and continuously buff up the creatures to create a challenging threat for the opponent to deal with. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Temple Garden and Horizon Canopy helps to maintain consistency in drawing the necessary cards for the strategy to succeed."

The win condition is to punish the opponent for having few cards in hand with cards like The Rack and Shrieking Affliction. Additionally, the deck uses cards like Raven's Crime and Ghost Quarter to disrupt the opponent's land base. The goal is to grind down the opponent's resources and win through attrition."
