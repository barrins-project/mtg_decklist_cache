The goal is to play big threats like Garruk, Caller of Beasts and Craterhoof Behemoth ahead of schedule to apply early pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Thragtusk and Scavenging Ooze provide resilience and board presence, while cards like Domri Rade and Elvish Visionary help draw and find key pieces to finish the game quickly."

Additionally, the deck utilizes creatures like Restoration Angel and Aetherling to provide a win condition. It aims to outlast opponents by denying them resources and overwhelming them in the late game."
