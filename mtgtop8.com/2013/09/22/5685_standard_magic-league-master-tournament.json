The deck also includes removal spells like Mizzium Mortars and Domri Rade to clear the way for attacks. Boros Reckoner and Ghor-Clan Rampager provide additional power and flexibility to the deck's aggressive game plan. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and relentless attacks using its Naya Human creatures."
