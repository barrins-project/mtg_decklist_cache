Thragtusk and Restoration Angel provide value and protection, while Sin Collector and Fiend Hunter disrupt the opponent's strategy. Lingering Souls provides additional threats and synergy with the other cards. The deck's mana base allows for consistent and efficient casting of spells, with Gavony Township providing a late-game advantage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and disruptive tactics."
