Utilizing a mix of creatures with evasion and lifelink, along with powerful angels that benefit from lifegain triggers, the deck aims to maintain board presence and outvalue the opponent. Additionally, the deck includes a versatile removal package to handle threats and clear the way for attacks. The mana base provides a mix of black and white sources to ensure smooth casting of spells from both colors."
