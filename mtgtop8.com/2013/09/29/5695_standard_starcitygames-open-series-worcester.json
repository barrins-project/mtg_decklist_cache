By using cards like Soldier of the Pantheon, Precinct Captain, and Boros Elite alongside combat tricks like Brave the Elements, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and apply constant pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Spear of Heliod and Heliod, God of the Sun provides additional support and buffs to the creatures, making them even more threatening on the battlefield."
