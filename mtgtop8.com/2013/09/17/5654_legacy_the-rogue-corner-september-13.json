            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to efficiently control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy while deploying aggressive threats that can quickly finish the game. By utilizing countermagic and removing key threats, the deck aims to protect its own creatures and clear the path for damage to be dealt. The inclusion of cards like Delver of Secrets and Geist of Saint Traft allow for fast clock pressure, while Grim Lavamancer provides additional reach and removal options. Overall, the deck focuses on tempo advantage and capitalizing on aggressive plays to secure victory."
