By using cards like Shock, Searing Spear, and Pillar of Flame to clear the way, along with efficient creatures like Young Pyromancer, Stromkirk Noble, and Chandra's Phoenix, this deck aims to apply pressure early and often. With a low mana curve and plenty of burn spells, this deck looks to maintain a fast pace and close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
