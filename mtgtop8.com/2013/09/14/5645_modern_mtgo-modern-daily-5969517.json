Removal spells like Lightning Bolt, Terminate, and Maelstrom Pulse help clear the way for your creatures to deal damage. The deck also utilizes mana acceleration from cards like Deathrite Shaman and mana fixing from the fetch lands in order to consistently cast its threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
