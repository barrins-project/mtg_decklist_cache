By playing low-cost creatures like Ash Zealot and Rakdos Cackler early on, combined with burn spells like Pillar of Flame and Searing Spear, the goal is to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total and finish them off before they can stabilize. The addition of hasty creatures like Lightning Mauler and Chandra's Phoenix adds to the deck's ability to apply pressure and close out games swiftly."
