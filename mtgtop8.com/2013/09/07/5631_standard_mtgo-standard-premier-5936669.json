It also has graveyard hate and life gain elements with cards like Scavenging Ooze and Putrefy. The deck's mana base is built to ensure consistency and flexibility in casting spells. Vraska the Unseen provides additional removal and win conditions, while Mutavault adds versatility and pressure on the opponent."
