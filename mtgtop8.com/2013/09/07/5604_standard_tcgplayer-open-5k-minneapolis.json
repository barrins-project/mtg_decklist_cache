            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly building a board presence with low-cost, aggressive white creatures and using them to overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Sublime Archangel and Silverblade Paladin enhances the efficiency of the attackers, while cards like Banisher Priest and Fiendslayer Paladin provide utility and protection. With a strong core of creatures and support spells like Searing Spear and Brave the Elements, the deck aims to win the game through early aggression and efficient combat tricks."
