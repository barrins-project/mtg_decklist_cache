Additionally, the deck includes ramp cards like Arbor Elf and Avacyn's Pilgrim to accelerate mana production, allowing for the early casting of powerful threats such as Craterhoof Behemoth. The deck's synergy and efficient reanimation strategy make it a strong contender in a Standard 1 vs 1 format."
