By efficiently using cards such as Cryptic Command, Wall of Omens, and Snapcaster Mage, the deck can disrupt the opponent's strategy while generating card advantage. The win condition stems from powerful threats like Restoration Angel and Celestial Colonnade, allowing the deck to shift gears from defense to offense when the time is right. With a strong mana base and a mix of reactive and proactive spells, the deck is designed to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a 1v1 setting."
