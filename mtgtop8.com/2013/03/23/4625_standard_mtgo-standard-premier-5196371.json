The deck also includes cards like Centaur Healer and Restoration Angel to provide some early game stability and board presence.

The deck also utilizes planeswalkers like Tamiyo and Sorin for additional card advantage and board control. Lingering Souls and other token generators help stabilize the board and provide blockers, while Nephalia Drownyard serves as a win condition by milling the opponent out."
