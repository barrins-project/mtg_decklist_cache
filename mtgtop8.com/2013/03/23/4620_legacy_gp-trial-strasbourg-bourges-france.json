The inclusion of cards like Delver of Secrets, Nimble Mongoose, and Tarmogoyf provide a strong aggressive element, while cards like Force of Will and Daze help protect its own threats and disrupt the opponent's spells. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, disruptive, and relentless in its pursuit of victory."
