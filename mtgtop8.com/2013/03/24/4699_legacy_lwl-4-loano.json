The deck aims to use cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Counterbalance, and Sensei's Divining Top to generate card advantage and manipulate the top of the deck to counter opponent's spells efficiently. Additionally, cards like Swords to Plowshares and Supreme Verdict are included for removal, while Rest in Peace and Energy Field provide protection and graveyard hate. The deck's win conditions include decking the opponent with Helm of Obedience or creating an army of Angels with Entreat the Angels."
