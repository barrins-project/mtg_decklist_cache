            "notes": "The deck focuses on playing aggressive Naya Human creatures that benefit from each other's presence on the battlefield, allowing for quick and efficient damage output. Cards like Mayor of Avabruck and Champion of the Parish grow stronger with each creature played, while cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Frontline Medic provide disruption and protection. By utilizing a mix of efficient creatures and burn spells like Searing Spear, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and consistent offensive strategy."
