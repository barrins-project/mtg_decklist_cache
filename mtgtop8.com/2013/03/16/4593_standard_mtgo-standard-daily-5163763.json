The combination of red burn spells, white removal, and blue control elements allows for a versatile and dynamic play style that can adapt to a variety of matchups. The inclusion of creatures like Restoration Angel and Augur of Bolas provides additional value and opportunities for tempo swings in your favor. This deck aims to put pressure on the opponent while maintaining control of the battlefield."
