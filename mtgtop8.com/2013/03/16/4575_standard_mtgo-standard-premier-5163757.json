The inclusion of powerful finishers like Kessig Wolf Run and Olivia Voldaren allows the deck to close out games quickly once it has gained control of the battlefield."

Restoration Angel and Snapcaster Mage provide additional value by reusing spells or saving creatures. The win condition is often milling the opponent with Nephalia Drownyard, while Jace, Memory Adept can also be used to mill or draw cards."
