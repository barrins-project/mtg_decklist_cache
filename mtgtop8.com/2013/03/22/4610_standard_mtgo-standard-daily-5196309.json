By using the reanimation ability to bring back these creatures onto the battlefield, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and win the game through sheer creature power. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Lingering Souls and Restoration Angel to provide additional value and flexibility in combat situations. The key concept is to quickly fill the graveyard and reanimate powerful creatures to dominate the game."
