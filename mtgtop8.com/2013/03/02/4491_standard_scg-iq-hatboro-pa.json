With powerful creatures like Thragtusk, Huntmaster of the Fells, and Olivia Voldaren alongside lifelinkers like Vampire Nighthawk, the deck aims to stabilize and grind out a win through attrition.

            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing graveyard recursion to bring powerful creatures back into play, creating explosive combos and overwhelming board presence. By filling the graveyard quickly with cards like Mulch and Grisly Salvage, the deck aims to reanimate creatures like Craterhoof Behemoth and Angel of Serenity to swing the game in its favor. Ramp cards like Avacyn's Pilgrim and Arbor Elf help accelerate the deck's strategy, while lands like Vault of the Archangel and Gavony Township provide additional utility and synergize well with the reanimated creatures."
