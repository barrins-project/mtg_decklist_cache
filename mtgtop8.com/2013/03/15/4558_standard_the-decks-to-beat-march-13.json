By using a combination of removal spells like Tragic Slip, Dreadbore, and Bonfire of the Damned, along with resilient threats like Huntmaster of the Fells and Thragtusk, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind them out of resources. Additionally, powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Garruk, Primal Hunter provide additional card advantage and ways to close out the game."

By utilizing efficient creatures like Rakdos Cackler, Ghor-Clan Rampager, and Falkenrath Aristocrat, paired with removal spells like Dreadbore and Abrupt Decay, the deck aims to apply early pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a mana base that supports the deck's tempo, this aggressive strategy aims to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize, making it a formidable force in Standard 1 vs 1 matchups."
