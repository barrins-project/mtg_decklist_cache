The deck aims to maintain a constant board presence by utilizing cards like Bloodghast, Gravecrawler, and Lotleth Troll, as well as reanimating creatures with cards like Geralf's Messenger. Liliana of the Veil serves both as removal and discard, while Blasting Station provides additional reach and combos with the deck's creatures. The deck's mana base is designed to support its aggressive game plan with a mix of dual lands and fetch lands."
