The key strategy is to reanimate powerful creatures such as Thragtusk, Restoration Angel, Angel of Serenity, and Craterhoof Behemoth to overwhelm the opponent. The combination of creatures with different effects and abilities, along with mana ramp cards like Arbor Elf and Avacyn's Pilgrim, allows for explosive plays and strong board presence. The deck also includes some lifegain and token generation to stabilize against aggressive decks."
