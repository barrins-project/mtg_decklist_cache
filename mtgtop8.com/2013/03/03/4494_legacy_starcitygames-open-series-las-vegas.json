            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to maintain control through disruption spells like Stifle, Spell Snare, and Spell Pierce, while also applying pressure with aggressive creatures like Tarmogoyf, Nimble Mongoose, and Delver of Secrets. The deck aims to quickly establish a board presence and disrupt the opponent's strategy through countermagic and land destruction with cards like Wasteland. The combination of efficient threats and disruption spells makes it a strong contender in the Legacy format, allowing players to control the game while applying pressure on their opponent."
