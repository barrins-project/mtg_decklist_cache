Once the graveyard is stocked, the deck utilizes Unburial Rites to bring back game-changing creatures like Angel of Serenity and Craterhoof Behemoth. Lingering Souls provides additional creatures to help stabilize the board and Overgrown Tomb ensures the mana base is consistent. The key strategy is to reanimate powerful creatures from the graveyard to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."

The deck also includes counterspells like Dissipate and removal like Devour Flesh to disrupt the opponent's plans. The win condition is to outvalue the opponent by drawing more cards and utilizing powerful creatures like Snapcaster Mage and Restoration Angel. Additionally, the deck includes the utility of Nephalia Drownyard for mill potential and Jace, Memory Adept for additional card advantage."
