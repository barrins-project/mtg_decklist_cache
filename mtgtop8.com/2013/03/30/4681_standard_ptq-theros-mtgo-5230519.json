It then transitions into a more midrange strategy with card draw and lifegain from Sphinx's Revelation and tempo plays with Rewind. The deck is capable of finishing the game quickly with powerful creatures like Aurelia, the Warleader and Restoration Angel, supported by versatile utility cards like Azorius Charm and Snapcaster Mage. The mana base is carefully constructed to enable consistent casting of all spells."
