It also puts pressure on them with aggressive creatures like Serra Avenger and Mirran Crusader. The deck seeks to control the board with cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Tectonic Edge, while also generating card advantage through Mentor of the Meek and Kitchen Finks. The deck can also protect its creatures with Eight-and-a-Half-Tails and disrupt graveyard strategies with Relic of Progenitus. Overall, the deck combines aggro and disruption elements to control the game."
