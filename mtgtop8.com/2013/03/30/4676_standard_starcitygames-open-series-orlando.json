By filling the graveyard with creature cards using cards like Grisly Salvage and Mulch, the deck can then bring them back into play with Unburial Rites. This reanimator combo strategy is supported by ramp cards like Arbor Elf and Avacyn's Pilgrim, as well as mana fixing lands. The deck also includes protective cards like Restoration Angel and lingering Souls to control the board and ensure the combo can be executed successfully."

            "notes": "The primary strategy of this deck is to control the board through mass removal spells like Supreme Verdict and Planar Cleansing, while gaining card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation and card selection with Think Twice. The deck also includes counterspells like Syncopate and Dissipate to disrupt the opponent's plays. With a mix of removal spells, counterspells, card draw, and win conditions like Jace, Memory Adept and Nephalia Drownyard, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind out a victory through control and attrition."

The key strategy is to combo off by reanimating creatures like Angel of Serenity or Craterhoof Behemoth to overwhelm the opponent. Cards like Grisly Salvage and Mulch help to stock the graveyard while cards like Deathrite Shaman and Lotleth Troll provide additional graveyard manipulation. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent by recurring powerful threats while also having a backup plan of beating down with efficient creatures."
