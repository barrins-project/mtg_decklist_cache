            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the opponent's board through a combination of removal spells and powerful creatures like Huntmaster of the Fells, Olivia Voldaren, and Thragtusk. With cards like Abrupt Decay, Dreadbore, Tragic Slip, and Victim of Night, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while staying ahead on board presence. The inclusion of Planeswalkers like Garruk, Primal Hunter and Liliana of the Veil adds additional versatility and card advantage. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and secure the win through attrition and efficient removal."
