Removal spells like Searing Spear and Mizzium Mortars help clear the way for attacks, while planeswalkers like Domri Rade and Garruk Relentless provide additional utility and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to put pressure on opponents early and maintain a strong board presence to secure victory."
