You can also use cards like Mulch and Grisly Salvage to fill up your graveyard with creatures to reanimate. By combining the combo and reanimator strategies, you can overwhelm your opponent with huge threats like Angel of Serenity and Thragtusk. The deck's synergy between ramp, reanimation, and powerful creatures make it a formidable force in a 1 vs 1 matchup."

By playing cards like Strangleroot Geist, Hellrider, and Gyre Sage early on, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent and end the game quickly. With cards like Ghor-Clan Rampager and Burning-Tree Emissary providing additional aggression, the deck can quickly build a threatening board presence. Domri Rade helps to generate card advantage and provide additional removal, while Wolfir Silverheart can create huge threats that are difficult for the opponent to deal with."
