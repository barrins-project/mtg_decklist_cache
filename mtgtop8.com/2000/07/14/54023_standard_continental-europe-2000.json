The deck also includes cards that provide support, protection, and disruption, such as Mother of Runes and Disenchant. The inclusion of powerful anthem effects like Crusade and Glorious Anthem boosts the strength of the weenies, making them more threatening. Additionally, the deck has options for controlling the board with cards like Armageddon and Parallax Wave, ensuring continued advantage against the opponent."
