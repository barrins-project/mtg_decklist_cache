By utilizing counterspells, card draw, and disruptive creatures like Thieving Magpie and Masticore, it aims to outlast opponents and slowly grind them down. With key cards like Treachery for stealing threats and Thwart for additional control, alongside strong finishers like Morphling, the deck seeks to dominate the game through careful resource management and strategic decision-making."
