It utilizes enchantments like Opalescence, Parallax Tide, and Parallax Wave to manipulate the opponent's board and disrupt their plans. Additionally, it includes cards like Lilting Refrain and Energy Field to protect itself and prolong the game. It also includes a small amount of removal and board wipes to deal with threats. The deck's mana base is focused on lands that produce both white and blue mana."
