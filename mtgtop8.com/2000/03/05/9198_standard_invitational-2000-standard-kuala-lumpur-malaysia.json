The deck aims to establish a solid board presence early in the game, using cards like Ramosian Sergeant and Ramosian Lieutenant to quickly summon multiple creatures. Glorious Anthem enhances the power and toughness of all creatures, making them harder to deal with. Disenchant offers removal against problematic enchantments and artifacts, while Mother of Runes provides protection. Overall, the deck aims to create a fast and resilient aggro force."
