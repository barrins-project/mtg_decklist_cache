It utilizes cards that drain the opponent's life, such as Sovereign's Bite and Alms of the Vein, while also including removal spells like Cast Down. The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a mix of direct damage and creatures that can chip away at their life total. The mana base includes a mix of swamps and dual lands to ensure consistent mana production for casting spells."
