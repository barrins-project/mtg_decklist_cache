            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressively dealing damage to the opponent using a combination of burn spells and creatures with haste and prowess abilities. The goal is to maintain pressure on the opponent from the early game and quickly reduce their life total to zero. By utilizing fast creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Emberheart Challenger alongside efficient burn spells like Shock and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. Additionally, cards like Slickshot Show-Off and Fugitive Codebreaker provide additional reach and flexibility in dealing damage."
