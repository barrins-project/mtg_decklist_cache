Cards like Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Skyknight Vanguard help buff creatures and provide additional support, while cards like Goblin Rabblemaster and Amped Raptor put pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Static Prison and Galvanic Discharge to control the opponent's board. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence and finish the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
