By quickly deploying threats like Monastery Swiftspear and Emberheart Challenger, along with efficient removal like Shock and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Charming Scoundrel and Witchstalker Frenzy provide additional ways to pressure the opponent, while cards like Squee, Dubious Monarch and Goddric, Cloaked Reveler offer recurring threats. The inclusion of Mishra's Foundry and Obliterating Bolt gives the deck some versatility and reach in longer games."
