The deck also includes cards like Sowing Mycospawn and Kozilek's Command to control the battlefield and protect your creatures. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with aggressive plays and powerful creatures, supported by a mix of mana acceleration and disruption spells. The deck aims to quickly close out the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
