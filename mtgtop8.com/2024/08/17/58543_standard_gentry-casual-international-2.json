By playing aggressively and efficiently using mana, the deck aims to establish early board control and apply continuous pressure on the opponent. With a mix of fast creatures like Poison Dart Frog and powerful buffs like Flourishing Bloom-Kin, the deck can quickly build up a formidable army and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to recover. The inclusion of Nissa, Ascended Animist provides a powerful late-game option for additional card advantage and board presence."
