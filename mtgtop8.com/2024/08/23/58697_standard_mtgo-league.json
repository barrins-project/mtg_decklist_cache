Cards like Get Lost and Assimilation Aegis disrupt the opponent's strategy, while cards like Thran Spider and Braided Net defend against threats. The deck also includes utility cards like The Irencrag for extra mana and Fabrication Foundry for creating artifacts. The goal is to outlast the opponent by controlling the board and gradually wearing them down with efficient removal and strategic plays."
