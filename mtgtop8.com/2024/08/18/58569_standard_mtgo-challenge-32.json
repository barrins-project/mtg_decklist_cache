The deck aims to maintain board presence and card advantage while steadily building towards a win condition with cards like White Sun's Twilight and Archangel Elspeth. The strategy is to establish dominance and control the game until victory is achieved."

With a mix of counter spells, removal, and card draw, this deck aims to outlast opponents and win through attrition. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to all colors needed for the deck's spells."

The key strategy is to overwhelm opponents with a combination of efficient creatures like Iridescent Vinelasher, Gev, Scaled Scorch, and Laughing Jasper Flint, while using removal spells like Go for the Throat and Cut Down to control the board. The deck aims to end the game quickly by delivering consistent damage and putting pressure on opponents to respond to the threats on the battlefield."
