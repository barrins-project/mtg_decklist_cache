The deck focuses on utilizing affinity for artifacts to cast cards quickly and efficiently, while also including removal and card draw to maintain board presence and disrupt the opponent's strategy. By combining aggressive creatures with powerful spells, the deck aims to establish a quick and dominant position in the game, capitalizing on synergy between artifacts and supporting cards."
