The deck focuses on dealing damage quickly using spells like Lightning Strike and Shock, while also using enchantments like Monstrous Rage to boost the power of its creatures. Mishra's Foundry and Rockface Village provide additional support, while Slickshot Show-Off and Wrenn's Resolve offer extra versatility and resilience. The goal is to control the battlefield and defeat the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
