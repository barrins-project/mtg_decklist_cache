The main goal is to set up the combo as quickly as possible while keeping the opponent off balance with disruption. The companion card, Jegantha, the Wellspring, provides additional mana ramp and a backup win condition."

The deck also includes cards like Selfless Savior and Skyclave Apparition for protection and removal.
