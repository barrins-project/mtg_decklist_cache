It also utilizes powerful cards like Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury to push through damage and control the board. The inclusion of Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion adds consistency and additional mana acceleration to keep the pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win the game quickly through aggressive creature-based strategies with a splash of burn and control elements."
