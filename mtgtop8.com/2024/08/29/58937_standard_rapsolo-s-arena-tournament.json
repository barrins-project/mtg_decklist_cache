The deck focuses on maintaining a fast tempo by playing low-cost creatures like Manifold Mouse and Emberheart Challenger, supported by pump spells like Might of the Meek. Cards like Heartfire Hero and Valley Questcaller provide additional value by either buffing creatures or generating card advantage. The mana base is optimized for speed and consistency, allowing the deck to apply pressure early and close out games before opponents can stabilize."
