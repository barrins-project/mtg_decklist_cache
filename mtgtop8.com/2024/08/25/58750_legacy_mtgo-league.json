It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while developing its own resources and establishing control through powerful planeswalkers like Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The deck also includes win conditions like Entreat the Angels and Triumph of Saint Katherine to close out the game once it has taken control. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Blood Moon can further disrupt the opponent's mana base and give the deck an edge in certain matchups."

The deck also includes cards like Sowing Mycospawn and Nulldrifter to provide additional aggression and card advantage. The inclusion of cards like Cavern of Souls and Eye of Ugin ensures that the Eldrazi spells can be cast efficiently and effectively, overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats."
