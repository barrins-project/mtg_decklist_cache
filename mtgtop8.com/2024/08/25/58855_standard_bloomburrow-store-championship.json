With support cards like Serum Snare and Reasonable Doubt to control the opponent's board, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient offense. Fleeting Reflection allows for additional aggression, while cards like Shore Up and Skrelv's Hive provide protection and resilience. The mana base is optimized for consistent and smooth play, ensuring that the deck can maintain its aggression throughout the game."
