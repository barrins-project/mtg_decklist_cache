The deck focuses on deploying low-cost creatures like Knight-Errant of Eos and Novice Inspector, while also using powerful spells like Gleeful Demolition to control the board. The inclusion of cards like Resolute Reinforcements and Warden of the Inner Sky allows for a strong finish, while cards like Sanguine Evangelist provide additional support. The efficient mana base ensures consistent plays and the use of Cavern of Souls protects against counterspells."
