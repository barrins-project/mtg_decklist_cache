Key cards like Terror of the Peaks and Spinewoods Armadillo can deal massive damage to the opponent or clear their board. Brotherhood's End and Outcaster Trailblazer provide removal options while Smuggler's Surprise and Glimpse the Core help maintain card advantage. The deck aims to pressure the opponent early and win the game before they can stabilize. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive game plan with a mix of lands that provide both red and green mana."
