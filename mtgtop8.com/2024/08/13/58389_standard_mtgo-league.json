The deck focuses on maintaining board control through cards like Elspeth's Smite and Demolition Field, while also generating card advantage with Meticulous Archive and Caretaker's Talent. By combining removal spells with counter magic, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and win the match through attrition. The deck also includes a few finishers like Archangel Elspeth and Beza, the Bounding Spring to close out the game."
