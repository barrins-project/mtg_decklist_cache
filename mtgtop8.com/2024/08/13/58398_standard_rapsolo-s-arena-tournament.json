The deck focuses on flooding the board with creatures such as Lord Skitter, Sewer King and Vren, the Relentless, supported by cards like Phantom Interference and Malicious Eclipse to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption, while Karumonix, the Rat King and Azure Beastbinder offer additional threats to pressure the opponent. The deck's mana base is designed to support both colors equally for maximum efficiency."
