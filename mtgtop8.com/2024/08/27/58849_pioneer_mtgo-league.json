The goal is to stall the opponent's game plan with cards like Strict Proctor, Tale's End, and Settle the Wreckage while setting up for big plays with cards like Memory Deluge and Sphinx's Revelation. The deck also includes alternate win conditions like Castle Ardenvale and Shark Typhoon to close out the game."
