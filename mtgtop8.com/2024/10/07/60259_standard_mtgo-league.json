It also includes powerful removal spells like Go for the Throat to control the board. The key strategy is to quickly deplete the opponent's resources while steadily building up your own board presence. Cards like Case of the Stashed Skeleton and Corpses of the Lost allow for recursion and value generation, ensuring that the pressure is maintained throughout the game. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a relentless stream of threats and disruption."
