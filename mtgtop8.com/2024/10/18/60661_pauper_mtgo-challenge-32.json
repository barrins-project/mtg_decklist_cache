The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by trading resources efficiently and eventually overwhelming them with a combination of removal, card draw, and creature recursion. It can also generate card advantage and life gain through various spells and abilities to outlast aggressive strategies."

By playing cheap, hexproof creatures like Slippery Bogle and Silhana Ledgewalker, the deck can avoid removal spells and quickly buff them up with auras such as Rancor, Ethereal Armor, and Ancestral Mask. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a huge, hexproof creature that can deal significant damage each turn while also gaining life and protecting itself. The deck relies on efficient mana sources like Utopia Sprawl and Abundant Growth to ensure it can cast its powerful auras quickly."
