            "notes": "The main concept of this Modern Aggro - Humans deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy, utilizing the synergy between Human creatures and powerful support cards. The deck focuses on playing low-cost creatures like Champion of the Parish and Thalia's Lieutenant to quickly build a threatening board presence. Aether Vial and Ancient Ziggurat help to cheat creatures into play, while cards like Meddling Mage and Ranger-Captain of Eos disrupt the opponent's strategy. By combining speed, synergy, and disruption, this deck aims to establish dominance early in the game and secure a quick victory."
