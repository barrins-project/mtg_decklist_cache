The key idea is to apply early pressure with efficient threats like Bonecrusher Giant and Bloodtithe Harvester, while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Archfiend of the Dross and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger to close out the game quickly. The land base is streamlined to support the aggressive game plan and ensure smooth mana development."
