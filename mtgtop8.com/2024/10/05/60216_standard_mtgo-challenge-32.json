The deck includes a variety of removal spells and disruptive creatures to keep the opponent on the back foot, while also utilizing cards like Enduring Curiosity and Fountainport to draw more cards and maintain card advantage. The main strategy is to apply pressure early in the game with aggressive creatures and efficient removal spells, setting up for a quick victory before the opponent can stabilize."
