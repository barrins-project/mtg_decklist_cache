The goal is to quickly build up a powerful, evasive threat that can overwhelm the opponent with a combination of enchantments. The deck includes a variety of auras to boost the creatures' power and toughness, as well as provide additional benefits such as lifelink and trample. By efficiently building up a creature with auras, the deck aims to quickly close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
