The goal is to control the game by managing threats and resources, limiting the opponent's options while building up card advantage with cards like Jace, the Perfected Mind and Impulse. The deck also includes a win condition in Doomsday Excruciator, a powerful finisher that can quickly close out the game once the opponent's resources are depleted. The mana base is designed to support the deck's control elements while ensuring consistent access to all colors of mana."
