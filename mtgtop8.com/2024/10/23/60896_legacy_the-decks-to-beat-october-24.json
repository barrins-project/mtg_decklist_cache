It uses cards like Goblin Engineer and Goblin Welder to find and recur the combo pieces efficiently. Additionally, the deck includes disruptive elements like Pyroblast and Red Elemental Blast to protect the combo and disrupt opponent's plays. The deck also includes cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Agatha's Soul Cauldron to control the board and buy time to assemble the combo. Overall, the deck aims to quickly set up the combo and win the game before the opponent can respond."
