By sacrificing creatures and using various spells like Deadly Dispute and Malevolent Rumble, the deck aims to combo off and overwhelm the opponent with card advantage and damage output. The inclusion of cards like Cleansing Wildfire and Vines of Vastwood provides additional utility and protection, while the mana base ensures consistency in casting spells. Overall, the deck is designed to execute a lethal combo while maintaining a solid board presence."
