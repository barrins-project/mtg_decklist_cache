This allows you to quickly ramp up to play powerful creatures like Avenging Hunter and Annoyed Altisaur. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to consistently draw into your combo pieces, and cards like Saruli Caretaker and Llanowar Elves provide additional mana acceleration. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with massive creatures and win quickly."
