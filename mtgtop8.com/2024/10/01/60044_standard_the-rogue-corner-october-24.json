By utilizing Overlords like Overlord of the Mistmoors and Overlord of the Hauntwoods, along with cards like Leyline Binding and Temporary Lockdown, the deck aims to lock down the opponent's board and prevent them from executing their game plan effectively. Additionally, cards like Up the Beanstalk and Urabrask's Forge provide ramp and additional threats to pressure the opponent. Overall, the strategy focuses on controlling the game's pace and dictating the flow of play."
