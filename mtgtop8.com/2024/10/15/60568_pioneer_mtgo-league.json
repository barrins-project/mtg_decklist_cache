By using cards like Collected Company and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent while also disrupting their game plan. The combination of creatures like Aven Interrupter and Skyclave Apparition with mana ramp from Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves allows for quick tempo plays and efficient threats. Overall, this deck focuses on fast-paced aggression and disrupting the opponent's strategy."
