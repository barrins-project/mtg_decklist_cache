The deck also includes cards like Warped Tusker and Writhing Chrysalis to generate value and outvalue the opponent. Lead the Stampede and Ancient Stirrings help to find key pieces of the deck, while Energy Refractor acts as a versatile mana fixer. Overall, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence and overpower the opponent with its powerful creatures."

Malevolent Rumble serves as removal against opponent's creatures, while Generous Ent provides card advantage. The deck includes a mix of big creatures like Cavern Stomper and Goliath Paladin, alongside smaller utility creatures like Arbor Elf and Eldrazi Repurposer. The inclusion of Leonin Armorguard and Eagles of the North adds some resilience to the deck, making it a strong and fast-paced Aggro archetype."
