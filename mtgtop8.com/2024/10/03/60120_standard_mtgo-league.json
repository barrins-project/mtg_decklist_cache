By utilizing the synergy between cards like Corpses of the Lost and Case of the Stashed Skeleton, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor and Tinybones, the Pickpocket provide additional value and disruption to further support the aggressive game plan."
