By enchanting creatures with cards like Ethereal Armor and All That Glitters, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm opponents with large, evasive threats. The inclusion of cards like Stubborn Denial and Shardmage's Rescue help protect key creatures, while cards like Curious Obsession and Staggering Insight provide additional card advantage and evasion. With the help of the companion Jegantha, the Wellspring, the deck can maintain a consistent game plan and pressure opponents early and often."

By using cards that increase devotion to green, such as Leyline of the Guildpact and Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner, the deck can quickly ramp up its mana production. This allows for the early casting of strong creatures like Cavalier of Thorns and Old-Growth Troll, backed up by support cards like Storm the Festival and Ulvenwald Oddity. The deck aims to establish board dominance and pressure the opponent relentlessly."

By efficiently managing resources and controlling the pace of the game, the deck aims to gradually wear down the opponent and secure victory through attrition.

It aims to stall the game until it can establish a dominant position with powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and efficient board wipes like Supreme Verdict. The deck also utilizes land disruption with Field of Ruin and Restless Anchorage to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the strategy revolves around maintaining control of the battlefield and resources to eventually secure a win through attrition and card advantage."
