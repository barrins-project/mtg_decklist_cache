The key strategy involves controlling the game tempo by countering key spells, removing threats, and generating incremental advantage through card draw and resource manipulation. By consistently out-valuing opponents and controlling the board, the deck aims to grind out victories through attrition and overwhelming card advantage. The deck's mana base is also carefully constructed to ensure consistent access to all the necessary colors for its powerful spells."
