This deck also includes card draw and disruption spells to maintain tempo and consistency in order to outmaneuver opponents and continuously bring back Arclight Phoenix for maximum pressure."

Additionally, the deck aims to out-value the opponent by utilizing graveyard recursion with cards like Sheoldred's Edict and Graveyard Trespasser. The creatures in the deck are powerful finishers that can quickly close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. The mana base is designed to support the deck's strategy with utility lands and plenty of swamps."

The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria to generate card advantage and The Wandering Emperor for additional control options. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements while providing some utility lands for specific situations. It aims to outvalue opponents and eventually win through incremental advantage and superior resource management."
