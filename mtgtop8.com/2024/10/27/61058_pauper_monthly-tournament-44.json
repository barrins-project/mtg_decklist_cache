By utilizing cards like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement to generate large amounts of mana, the deck can cast spells like Valakut Invoker to deal massive damage to the opponent. Cards like Saruli Caretaker and Quirion Ranger help accelerate the mana production, while Lead the Stampede and Winding Way provide card advantage to find the combo pieces quickly. The key strategy is to stall the opponent with walls while ramping up to the combo finish."
