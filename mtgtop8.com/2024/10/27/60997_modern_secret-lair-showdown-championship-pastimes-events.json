The key concept is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast start from low-cost creatures like Amped Raptor and Ocelot Pride, while also using cards like Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury to push damage through. Thoughtseize and Static Prison disrupt the opponent's game plan, while the inclusion of Goblin Bombardment provides additional reach. The deck utilizes a mix of efficient lands and powerful artifacts to support its aggressive game plan."
