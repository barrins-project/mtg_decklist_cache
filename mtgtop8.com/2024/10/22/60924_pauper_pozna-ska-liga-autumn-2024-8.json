By quickly generating mana with cards like Priest of Titania and Birchlore Rangers, players can swarm the board with powerful creatures like Timberwatch Elf and Nyxborn Hydra. Cards like Winding Way and Lead the Stampede help to maintain card advantage and keep the pressure on the opponent. The overall goal is to build a strong board presence and deal a lot of damage quickly to secure victory."

Generous Ent and Avenging Hunter provide additional threats to overwhelm the opponent. With careful sequencing and timing, the player can assemble their combo pieces and overwhelm their opponent with a massive wall of creatures."
