By utilizing low mana cost creatures like Voldaren Epicure and Sneaky Snacker, paired with efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Faithless Looting and Grab the Prize help to maintain card advantage and synergy within the deck. Overall, the deck focuses on applying pressure and finishing the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
