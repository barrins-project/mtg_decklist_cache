With a mix of removal spells and creature cards that provide card advantage, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and disrupt their game plan. The inclusion of key cards like Builder's Talent and Enduring Innocence helps to further solidify the control strategy, while cards like Carrot Cake and Caretaker's Talent provide additional utility and resilience. Overall, the deck excels at maintaining board control and grinding out incremental advantages to secure victory."

By efficiently managing resources and denying the opponent's threats, the deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent until it can establish a dominant position on the board. The deck utilizes powerful control cards like Jace, the Perfected Mind, Deadly Cover-Up, and Doomsday Excruciator to control the pace of the game and dictate the flow of the match."
