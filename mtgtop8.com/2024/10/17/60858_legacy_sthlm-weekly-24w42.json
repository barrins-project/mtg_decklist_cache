The deck utilizes powerful cards like Liliana of the Veil and Fatal Push to control the board, while also utilizing efficient creatures like Dauthi Voidwalker and Troll of Khazad-d√ªm to apply pressure. Additionally, the deck has a reanimation package with cards like Reanimate and Fell the Profane to bring back key creatures for additional value. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and disruptive game plan."
