By playing low-cost creatures like Clockwork Percussionist and Reckless Lackey, as well as powerful Instant spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, you can deal damage to your opponent fast. Utilizing cards like Kuldotha Rebirth and Goblin Grenade can help you swarm the board with creatures and finish off your opponent in one big burst. With a focus on speed and efficiency, this deck aims to win the game before your opponent can react."
