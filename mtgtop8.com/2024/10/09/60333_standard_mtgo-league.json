By combining cards like Monstrous Rage and Might of the Meek, you can boost your creatures' power and deal significant damage quickly. Leyline of Resonance allows you to reduce the cost of your spells, while cards like Turn Inside Out and Heartfire Hero provide additional removal and damage options. Overall, this deck aims to establish early board presence and apply constant pressure to secure a quick victory in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
