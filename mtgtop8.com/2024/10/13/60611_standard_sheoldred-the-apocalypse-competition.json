            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the game by removing opponent's threats and countering their spells while using Jace, the Perfected Mind and other cards to generate card advantage and out value the opponent. It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and eventually win through efficient removal and card advantage. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Doomsday Excruciator and Harvester of Misery to close out the game once the opponent is sufficiently controlled. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the control strategy and allow for consistent casting of spells."
