The deck also utilizes graveyard synergies with cards like Unearth and Murktide Regent to further improve its control capabilities and adapt to different matchups. Overall, the key strategy is to grind out the opponent and emerge victorious through careful decision-making and resource management."

The key focus is on using The One Ring to generate value and create advantage while controlling the board with powerful creatures like Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury and Solitude. The deck aims to maintain a strong tempo advantage by efficiently answering threats and setting up its own win conditions. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize consistency in casting spells."
