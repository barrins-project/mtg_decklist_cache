The deck includes a variety of control spells and removal to disrupt the opponent's strategy, while also running a high number of defensive creatures and artifacts to protect the player's life total. The goal is to outlast the opponent and slowly grind them down while maintaining card advantage and board presence."

Slickshot Show-Off and Leyline of Resonance act as additional sources of damage. The mana base is designed to provide consistency and allow for smooth curve progression. Overall, the goal is to win the game as fast as possible through the use of efficient aggression."

The deck also includes some spells for protection and card advantage. The mana base is focused on providing a good balance between the different colors needed for the deck's spells. Overall, the strategy is to put the pressure on the opponent early and maintain it with a steady stream of threats and answers."

The deck relies on building a board presence quickly and using cards like Monstrous Rage and Turn Inside Out to pump up creatures for massive damage. The inclusion of cards like Leyline of Resonance and Karplusan Forest help to ensure the deck runs smoothly and efficiently. With a mix of direct damage spells and combat modifiers, this deck aims to finish off opponents before they have a chance to stabilize."

The addition of cards like Spyglass Siren and Gleeful Demolition provide disruption and removal to further support the aggressive strategy. By controlling the board and applying constant pressure, this deck aims to secure a quick victory against opponents."

By combining powerful creatures like Archfiend of the Dross and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse with removal spells like Go for the Throat and Cut Down, the deck aims to control the board while dealing heavy damage to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Duress and Anoint with Affliction also helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan, allowing for a faster clock to secure victory. Sheoldred's Edict provides additional removal, making it difficult for the opponent to establish a defense against this aggressive strategy."
