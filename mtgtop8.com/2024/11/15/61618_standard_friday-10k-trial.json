The deck aims to control the battlefield early on with creatures like Faerie Mastermind and Spyglass Siren, while also disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Cut Down and Go for the Throat. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Enduring Curiosity and Tishana's Tidebinder to provide card advantage and maintain pressure. Overall, the deck is focused on quickly building a board presence and finishing off the opponent before they can stabilize."
