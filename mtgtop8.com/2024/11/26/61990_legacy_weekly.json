By sacrificing creatures like Narcomoeba and Bridge from Below, the deck aims to win the game through alternative win conditions like Thassa's Oracle or by overwhelming the opponent with Fell the Profane. The deck is designed to be fast and efficient, utilizing cards like Dark Ritual and Lotus Petal to gain an advantage and disrupt the opponent's game plan using cards like Cabal Therapy and Thoughtseize."
