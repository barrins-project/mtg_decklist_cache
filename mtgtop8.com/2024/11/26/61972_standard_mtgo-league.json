By playing low-cost creatures like Emberheart Challenger and Monastery Swiftspear combined with burn spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Monstrous Rage and Witchstalker Frenzy provide additional creature buffs to help close out the game, while Rockface Village and Hired Claw help to ramp up the aggression. The goal is to maintain pressure on the opponent and win the game before they can stabilize."

The key strategy is to efficiently stock the graveyard and then overwhelm the opponent with a sudden influx of powerful creatures, creating a strong board presence and putting pressure on the opponent to react quickly. Additionally, the deck includes disruptive elements like Duress to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect the combo pieces."
