By using cards like Ral, Crackling Wit and Hidetsugu's Second Rite to deal direct damage, along with efficient card draw and creature removal, the deck aims to control the battlefield and deal damage efficiently. Cards like Three Steps Ahead and Into the Flood Maw help to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent. With a mix of direct damage, card advantage, and aggressive creatures, this deck aims to end the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
