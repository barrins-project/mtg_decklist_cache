It aims to overwhelm the opponent with cheap artifacts and creatures that allow for efficient card draw and removal. By generating resources from sacrificing artifacts and using affinity mechanics, the deck can maintain a high tempo throughout the game. Additionally, it includes both burn spells to finish off opponents and disruptive elements to disrupt opponent strategies. The deck combines aggression with card advantage to outpace and outmaneuver opponents in a Pauper 1 vs 1 setting."
