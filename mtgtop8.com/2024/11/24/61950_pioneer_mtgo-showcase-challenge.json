The main strategy is to assemble a variety of answers and threats from different colors, using cards like Bring to Light and Leyline Binding to control the board while generating card advantage. With the flexibility to access powerful spells across multiple colors, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents in a slower, more controlling game plan."

Cards like Brave the Elements provide protection for key creatures, while Declaration in Stone offers removal for any potential threats. The inclusion of mana-fixing lands like Cavern of Souls and utility lands like Castle Ardenvale help to support the aggressive game plan."

By utilizing cards like Ethereal Armor, All That Glitters, and Sheltered by Ghosts, the deck can create large threats that can deal significant damage early in the game. The inclusion of Sram, Senior Edificer and Mox Amber helps to draw cards and generate mana to keep up the pressure on the opponent. With the help of Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and auras, securing a quick victory."
