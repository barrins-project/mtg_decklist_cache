It supports the ramp strategy with countermagic and removal spells to control the game and protect the Eldrazi threats. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with large, game-ending creatures while disrupting their game plan through control elements. It combines tempo plays with powerful late-game threats to dominate the battlefield and close out the game quickly."
