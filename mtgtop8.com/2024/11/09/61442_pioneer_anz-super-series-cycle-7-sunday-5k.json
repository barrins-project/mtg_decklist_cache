The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats while utilizing cards like Collected Company to generate additional value. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive game plan by including plenty of untapped dual lands. This deck seeks to establish board presence early and maintain it through efficient creatures and disruptive spells."
