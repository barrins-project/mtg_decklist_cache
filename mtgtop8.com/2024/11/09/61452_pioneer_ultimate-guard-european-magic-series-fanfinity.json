The inclusion of cards like Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion and Vraska, Golgari Queen provide additional value and flexibility in this aggressive deck. The lands in the deck also allow for consistent mana production and color fixing to ensure smooth gameplay."

The deck also utilizes graveyard interaction with cards like Cling to Dust and Graveyard Trespasser. The creatures in the deck, such as Bloodletter of Aclazotz and Unstoppable Slasher, are resilient and provide additional ways to pressure the opponent while maintaining control of the game. The mana base includes utility lands like Castle Locthwain and Mutavault to improve the deck's flexibility and consistency."

The deck utilizes disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Duress to control the game while setting up the combo, and removal spells like Fatal Push and Torch the Tower to deal with threats. The inclusion of Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion provides additional mana acceleration and flexibility to support the combo strategy. The deck aims to win through a combination of powerful creatures and efficient removal."
