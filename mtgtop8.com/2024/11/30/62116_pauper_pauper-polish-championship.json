By cycling through their deck quickly and keeping themselves alive with fog effects, the player aims to assemble their combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with card advantage. The deck is built around creating a lock on the game by preventing attacks and effectively controlling the pace of the match until they can execute their win condition."

Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help you dig for your combo pieces while cards like Drift of Phantasms and Tamiyo's Safekeeping provide utility and protection. This deck focuses on creating a powerful engine to overwhelm your opponent with explosive plays."
