The deck aims to control the board with aggressive creatures like It That Heralds the End and Glaring Fleshraker while also utilizing powerful lands like Eye of Ugin and Wasteland to maintain pressure on the opponent. With a mix of card draw, mana acceleration, and disruption, this deck is designed to apply early pressure and close out the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
