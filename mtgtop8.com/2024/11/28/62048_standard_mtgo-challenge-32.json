By playing aggressively and using a mix of creature damage and direct burn damage, the deck aims to chip away at the opponent's life total before they have a chance to stabilize. With a low curve and plenty of aggressive threats, the deck relies on maintaining pressure and closing out the game as quickly as possible."
