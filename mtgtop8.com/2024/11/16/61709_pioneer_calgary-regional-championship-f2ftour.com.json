The deck also aims to disrupt opponent's strategy with cards like Get Lost and Deduce. The mana base includes utility lands like Field of Ruin and Hall of Storm Giants to further control the game.

The deck also includes evasion creatures like Brazen Borrower and Faerie Mastermind to ensure consistent damage output. With a mix of disruption and aggressive threats, this deck aims to control the game while putting pressure on the opponent."
