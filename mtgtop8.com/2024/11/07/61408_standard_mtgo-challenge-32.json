The deck focuses on playing cards that can manipulate the board state, generate card advantage, and provide protection for your own threats. By effectively managing resources and strategically deploying key cards such as Leyline Binding and Zur, Eternal Schemer, the deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents until it can establish a dominant position and secure victory."
