The deck also features Zur, Eternal Schemer as a key card to tutor for important pieces. The mana base includes a variety of lands to ensure consistency in casting spells and activating abilities, while Leyline Binding helps to control the opponent's movements. Ultimately, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and dominate the game."
