By combining cards like Sadistic Glee, Deadly Dispute, and Basking Broodscale, the deck aims to create a strong synergy that allows for consistent card draw, removal, and creature generation. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Krark-Clan Shaman and Nihil Spellbomb provide disruption and control options against opposing strategies. Overall, the deck is designed to create a combo-centric gameplay style that can overwhelm opponents through efficient resource management and strategic plays."
