The deck also includes some control elements like counterspells and removal to help protect and clear the way for the Phoenix to attack. Overall, this deck aims to be aggressive and fast-paced, utilizing the Arclight Phoenix as a powerful finisher."

The goal is to assemble the combo pieces quickly, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and win the game through overwhelming mana advantage and powerful spells."

The deck utilizes a variety of control spells like Dovin's Veto and Supreme Verdict to keep the opponent's board in check, while cards like Three Steps Ahead and Omen of the Sea provide card advantage. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by blinking permanents for extra ETB triggers. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent by maintaining control of the game until victory."
