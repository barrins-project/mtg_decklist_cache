By efficiently countering opponent's spells and removing threats with cards like Snuff Out and Cryptic Serpent, the deck aims to gain card advantage and outvalue the opponent. The deck also includes evasive creatures like Gurmag Angler and Tolarian Terror to close out the game quickly once the opponent's resources have been depleted. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game and winning through attrition."
