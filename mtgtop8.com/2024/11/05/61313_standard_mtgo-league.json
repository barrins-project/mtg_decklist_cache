The deck focuses on controlling the game by destroying opponent's resources with cards like Cut Down, Pillage the Bog, and Go for the Throat, and maximizing card advantage with Dreams of Steel and Oil and Ghost Vacuum. Gisa, the Hellraiser provides additional pressure while Duress helps in disrupting the opponent's game plan further. The deck also includes land destruction with cards like Demolition Field to further slow down the opponent's game plan."
