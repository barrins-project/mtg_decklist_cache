It utilizes cards like Okiba Reckoner Raid, Raven of Fell Omens, and Serrated Scorpion to apply early pressure, while also including life-gain spells like Alms of the Vein and Sovereign's Bite. By combining these elements, the deck aims to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total and maintain card advantage to secure victory in Pauper 1 vs 1 matches."
