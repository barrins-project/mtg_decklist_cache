By utilizing cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Jund Hackblade, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure throughout the game. The inclusion of cards like Lightning Bolt and Violent Outburst allows for additional reach and removal, while cards like Rancor and Etali's Favor help to pump up creatures and enhance their abilities. With a mix of efficient creatures and spells, this deck seeks to win through swift and relentless aggression."
