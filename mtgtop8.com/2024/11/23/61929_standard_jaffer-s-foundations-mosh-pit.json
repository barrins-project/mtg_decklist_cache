The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan by destroying their creatures and countering their important spells. Additionally, it aims to close out the game with finishers like Jace, the Perfected Mind and Doomsday Excruciator. The mana base is designed to ensure a consistent supply of both blue and black mana, allowing the deck to cast its spells efficiently."
