The combo aspect comes from using Dramatic Reversal to untap all creatures and then tapping Petitioners multiple times in the same turn. The deck also includes card draw with Deep Analysis and Accumulated Knowledge, as well as creature removal with Masked Vandal and counter options with Pond Prophet. Universal Automaton and Mothdust Changeling provide flexibility and additional creature options. Overall, the deck aims to quickly mill opponents while maintaining board presence and life gain."

The strategy revolves around maintaining pressure and control to secure a victory."
