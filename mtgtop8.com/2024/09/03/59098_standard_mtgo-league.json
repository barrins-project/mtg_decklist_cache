Cards like Monstrous Rage and Might of the Meek help buff up your creatures for additional damage. Mishra's Foundry and Rockface Village provide support for mana fixing. Lightning Strike and Shock offer direct damage to finish off opponents or deal with threats. Fugitive Codebreaker and Wrenn's Resolve provide additional utility and flexibility in combat. Rabid Gnaw serves as a powerful finisher."
