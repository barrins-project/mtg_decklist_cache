Combined with Soul Warden and other creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a swarm of creatures. Protection spells like Prismatic Strands and Benevolent Bodyguard ensure that the tokens can survive and deal damage efficiently. Additionally, cards like Cenn's Enlistment and Battle Screech provide additional token generation to keep the pressure on opponents. Overall, this deck is designed to win through aggression and board presence."
