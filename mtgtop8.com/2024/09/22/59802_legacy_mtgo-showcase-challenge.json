It relies on countering spells with cards like Force of Will, using removal like Swords to Plowshares, and manipulating the top of its library with cards like Brainstorm and Ponder. The deck also utilizes powerful creatures like Murktide Regent and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to apply pressure and close out the game. Additionally, it includes cards like Life from the Loam to ensure a steady stream of lands and maintain control over the game."
