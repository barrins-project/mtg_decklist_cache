The deck also includes card advantage from cards like Augur of Bolas and Ponder, as well as token generation from Murmuring Mystic. The goal is to outlast the opponent through a combination of card advantage, removal, and countering spells until the player can secure a win condition through either direct damage or overwhelming the opponent with creatures."
