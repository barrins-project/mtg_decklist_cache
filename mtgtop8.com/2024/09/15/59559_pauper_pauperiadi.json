By sacrificing creatures and artifacts, you can draw cards, gain mana, and trigger effects from cards like Basking Broodscale and Krark-Clan Shaman. The Bridges and Twisted Landscape help fix mana while Tamiyo's Safekeeping and Duress provide disruption against opponents. Overall, the goal is to outvalue your opponent through sacrificing and drawing to overwhelm them with resources and eventually win the game."
