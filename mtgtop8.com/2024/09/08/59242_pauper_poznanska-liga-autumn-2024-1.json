It utilizes counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to control the board and maintain card advantage. The deck also includes a token generator to provide a win condition through attacking with tokens or using them as blockers. The goal is to out-value the opponent by efficiently controlling the game and overwhelming them with resources."
