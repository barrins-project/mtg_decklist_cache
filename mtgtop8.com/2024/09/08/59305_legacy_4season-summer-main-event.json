Then, players can use reanimation spells like Reanimate and Animate Dead to bring these creatures back onto the battlefield for a game-winning advantage. The deck also includes disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Force of Will to protect its combo pieces. Overall, the strategy revolves around utilizing the graveyard as a resource to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures."
