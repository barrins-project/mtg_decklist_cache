By sacrificing creatures, artifacts, and lands, the deck can generate card advantage and create a lethal board state with Writhing Chrysalis and Makeshift Munitions. The inclusion of Krark-Clan Shaman and Blood Fountain adds additional sacrifice outlets, while cards like Deadly Dispute and Fanatical Offering provide versatility in sacrificing creatures. With the ability to generate tokens and draw cards, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its synergistic combos and resource advantage."
