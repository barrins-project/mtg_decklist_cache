The deck aims to quickly establish a board presence and apply pressure to the opponent, utilizing card advantage and tempo plays to maintain control of the game. By efficiently deploying threats and protecting them with countermagic, the deck seeks to outpace the opponent and secure victory through a combination of damage and disruption."
