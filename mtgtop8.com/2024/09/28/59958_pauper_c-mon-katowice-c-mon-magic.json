The deck also includes protection spells like Prismatic Strands to safeguard your board against removal spells. By overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of creatures and using Guardian's Pledge to buff them up, the deck aims to win by overwhelming the opponent with small, efficient threats. Additionally, the deck includes some flyers like Kor Skyfisher and Eagles of the North to provide some evasion."
