By combining this with effects like Writhing Chrysalis and Makeshift Munitions, the deck aims to create a loop of sacrificing and recurring creatures to overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Ichor Wellspring and Cleansing Wildfire for additional card draw and mana fixing. Overall, the deck focuses on generating value through sacrificing creatures and using them to gain incremental advantage and win the game."
