The key is to constantly dig through the deck with draw spells and take advantage of the Phoenix's ability to return from the graveyard to apply pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Treasure Cruise and Opt helps maintain card advantage and fuel the graveyard for powerful plays. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and powerful creatures."

The deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero by efficiently using its low-cost creatures and direct damage spells, with Den of the Bugbear and Ramunap Ruins providing additional damage sources. The deck prioritizes speed and pressure to outpace the opponent and secure a swift victory."
