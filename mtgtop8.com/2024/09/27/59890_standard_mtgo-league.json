By efficiently deploying threats such as Knight-Errant of Eos and Warden of the Inner Sky, while also disrupting the opponent with cards like Gleeful Demolition and Spyglass Siren, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Resolute Reinforcements and Warleader's Call provides additional support for the aggressive game plan, allowing the deck to maintain momentum and push for victory."
