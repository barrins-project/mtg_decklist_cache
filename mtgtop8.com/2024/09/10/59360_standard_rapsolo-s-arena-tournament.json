It utilizes cards like Deduce and Three Steps Ahead to predict and counter opponents' moves while cards like Stroke of Midnight and Get Lost help to clear the opponent's board. The creatures in the deck also provide utility with abilities like bouncing or tapping down opposing threats. The deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent before closing out the game with powerful finishers like Archangel Elspeth and The Eternal Wanderer."
