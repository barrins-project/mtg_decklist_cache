Additionally, the deck includes ramp spells like Up the Beanstalk and Herd Migration to accelerate mana production and play bigger threats earlier in the game. The inclusion of cards like Temporary Lockdown and Get Lost provides further disruption to the opponent's game plan, allowing the control player to dictate the pace of the game."

The deck aims to outvalue opponents by generating card advantage with Caretaker's Talent and Carrot Cake, while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Get Lost and Temporary Lockdown. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Archangel Elspeth and Mirrex ensures that the deck can close out games efficiently once it gains control of the board."
