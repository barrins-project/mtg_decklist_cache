By utilizing cards like Flare of Denial, Hydroelectric Specimen, and Thundertrap Trainer to filter through the deck and control the board, the deck aims to quickly assemble the Charbelcher combo and deal lethal damage to the opponent. Counterspells and card draw provide additional support, while Jace, Wielder of Mysteries and Thassa's Oracle offer alternative win conditions if the Charbelcher combo is disrupted. The deck's strategy revolves around fast, efficient combo plays without relying on traditional land cards."

The key card in the deck is The One Ring, which serves as a versatile tool for both controlling the board and providing a powerful win condition. By carefully managing resources and using a combination of removal spells and counterspells, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and eventually overwhelm them with its threats. The inclusion of land fetch cards adds consistency to the deck's mana base, ensuring that you can cast your spells efficiently."

The deck aims to combo off with cards like Scapeshift and The One Ring to generate a massive amount of mana and power on the board, ultimately leading to a swift victory. Additionally, the deck includes ways to find key pieces like Expedition Map and Tolaria West to ensure consistency in executing its game plan."
