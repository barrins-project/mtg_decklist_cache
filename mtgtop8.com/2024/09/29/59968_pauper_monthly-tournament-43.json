The deck utilizes a combination of low-cost creatures like Glint Hawk and Thraben Inspector to put pressure on the opponent, while also controlling the board with removal spells like Cast Down. Additionally, the deck includes a mix of disruption spells like Duress and Suffocating Fumes to disrupt the opponent's hand and strategy. The mana base is designed to support the color requirements of the deck while also providing some utility lands for additional benefits."
