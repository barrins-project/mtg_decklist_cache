It also utilizes cards like Lead the Stampede to refill your hand with creatures and overwhelm your opponent with an aggressive strategy. Malevolent Rumble can help clear the opponent's board while Generous Ent provides additional card advantage. Overall, this deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure throughout the game."
