The key strategy involves casting spells like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way to find your combo pieces and then using mana-producing creatures like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement to generate enough mana to play powerful creatures like Annoyed Altisaur and Valakut Invoker. This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large board presence and powerful creatures."
