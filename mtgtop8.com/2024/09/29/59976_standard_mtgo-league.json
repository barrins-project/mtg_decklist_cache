By utilizing low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Callous Sell-Sword, combined with powerful enchantments like Leyline of Resonance and Monstrous Rage, you can quickly build a threatening board presence. The inclusion of cards like Emberheart Challenger and Slickshot Show-Off allows for additional damage and disruption, while cards like Turn Inside Out and Might of the Meek provide combat tricks to help push through damage. Overall, the key strategy is to apply early pressure and maintain board control to secure victory."
