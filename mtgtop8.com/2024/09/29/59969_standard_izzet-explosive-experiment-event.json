The mana base is designed to ensure consistency in casting spells, with Leyline of Resonance providing additional synergy with the aggressive game plan. The goal is to end the game as quickly as possible by constantly pressuring the opponent."

By controlling the board and generating advantage through card draw and token generation, the deck aims to establish a dominant position and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats. The inclusion of a few key finishers and versatile spells ensures that the deck can adapt to different game states and emerge victorious in the end."
