It aims to control the game by countering threats, disrupting the opponent's plans, and eventually overwhelming them with powerful late-game threats like Archangel Elspeth and The Eternal Wanderer. The deck includes a mix of counter spells, removal, card draw, and efficient creatures to maintain control of the board and win through attrition. By carefully managing resources and outmaneuvering the opponent, this deck can dominate the battlefield and emerge victorious."

With a mix of removal, card draw, and versatile planeswalkers like Ral, Crackling Wit, the deck seeks to outvalue the opponent and secure a victory through careful resource management and tactical play."
