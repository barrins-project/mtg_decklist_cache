By utilizing cards like Songs of the Damned, Cabal Ritual, and Dark Ritual, along with creatures like Drannith Healer and Drannith Stinger, the deck aims to quickly build a powerful board state and finish off the opponent in a single turn. Additionally, cards like Deadly Dispute and Restless Dreams provide additional ways to fuel the graveyard and generate value."
