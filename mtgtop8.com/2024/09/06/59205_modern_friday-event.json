Cards like All Is Dust help to clear the board of threats, while cards like Kozilek's Return provide additional removal options. Through the Breach allows for explosive plays, while Ancient Stirrings helps to find key pieces of the deck. The deck aims to control the game until it can cast its powerful Eldrazi threats and dominate the battlefield."
