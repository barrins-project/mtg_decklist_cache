It includes efficient creatures like Emberheart Challenger and Monastery Swiftspear, as well as combat tricks like Might of the Meek and Snakeskin Veil to push damage through. The deck also includes removal spells like Shock to deal with opposing threats. With a mix of early game aggression and late game finishers like Monstrous Rage, this deck aims to apply constant pressure and force opponents to react defensively."
