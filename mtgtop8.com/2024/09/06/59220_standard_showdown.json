The deck focuses on utilizing low-cost and efficient creatures such as Cheeky House-Mouse and Heartfire Hero to deal damage quickly. Cards like Monstrous Rage and Might of the Meek help boost the power of the creatures, while spells like Shock provide removal options. The deck also includes some protection and mana-fixing with cards like Lavaspur Boots and Cavern of Souls. Overall, the strategy is to maintain a strong board presence and pressure the opponent early in the game."
