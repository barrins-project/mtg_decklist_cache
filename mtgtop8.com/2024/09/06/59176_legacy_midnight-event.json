            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly establish board presence and apply pressure on the opponent by playing aggressive creatures such as Goblin Rabblemaster and Winota, Joiner of Forces. By utilizing cards like Simian Spirit Guide and fast mana sources like Chrome Mox and Lotus Petal, the deck aims to get ahead early in the game and maintain momentum. Additionally, the inclusion of disruptive elements like Archon of Emeria and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan and secure the advantage for the aggressive strategy."
