The deck also aims to generate card advantage and value through cards like Caretaker's Talent and Virtue of Loyalty, while utilizing powerful finishers like Archangel Elspeth and Urabrask's Forge to close out the game. The mana base is structured to support these strategies and ensure consistent access to the deck's powerful spells."

This is achieved by utilizing cards like Temporary Lockdown, Lay Down Arms, and Get Lost to stall the opponent while setting up win conditions like The Eternal Wanderer and Teferi, Temporal Pilgrim. Additionally, the deck includes card advantage tools like Caretaker's Talent and Demolition Field to stay ahead in resources. The mana base is designed to support the deck's dual-color requirements while also providing flexibility with Fabled Passage."
