Detective's Phoenix and Dragon's Rage Channeler can provide extra value and card advantage, while Thoughtseize helps disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base is built to support the aggressive strategy, with a mix of fetch lands and shock lands."

Murktide Regent and Psychic Frog provide strong threats on the board, while card selection and filtering is achieved through spells like Preordain and Consider. Overall, the deck focuses on maintaining control of the game until it can secure a win condition."

Jegantha, the Wellspring serves as a useful companion option for additional mana acceleration."

By combining land ramp and mana acceleration with cards that allow for additional land plays, the deck aims to quickly assemble a combo that can overwhelm the opponent with massive creatures and powerful effects. The goal is to create a board state that is difficult for the opponent to interact with, leading to a quick victory through overwhelming force."

This combo strategy allows the player to quickly reanimate powerful threats and overwhelm the opponent. Additionally, cards like Thoughtseize and Force of Negation provide disruption and protection for the combo pieces. The deck also includes cards like Tainted Indulgence and Psychic Frog to help with card draw and filtering. Overall, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and win the game in a flashy and explosive manner."
