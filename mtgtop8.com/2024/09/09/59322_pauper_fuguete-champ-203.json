It also includes disruptive spells like Spell Pierce and Counterspell to protect its creatures and control the game. With card draw and selection spells like Thought Scour, Brainstorm, and Ponder, as well as bounce spells like Boomerang, the deck aims to maintain tempo and outmaneuver the opponent. The inclusion of spells like Lórien Revealed and Sleep of the Dead provides additional ways to close out the game."
