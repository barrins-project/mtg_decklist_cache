Additionally, it includes efficient removal options like Fatal Push. The aggressive threats in the deck, such as Murktide Regent and Orcish Bowmasters, help close out games quickly."

The main strategy revolves around using cards like Entomb, Thoughtseize, and Grief to fill the graveyard with big creatures like Griselbrand and Archon of Cruelty, and then using cards like Exhume and Reanimate to bring them back onto the battlefield. The deck also includes additional disruption and protection with cards like Unmask and Troll of Khazad-dûm. Overall, the key concept of the deck is to rapidly reanimate big threats to overwhelm the opponent."
