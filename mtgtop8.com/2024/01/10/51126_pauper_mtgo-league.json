The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's plans and preventing them from advancing their board state. It includes various cantrips, such as Ponder and Preordain, to dig through the deck and find the necessary answers. It also includes a range of removal spells, like Agony Warp and Cast Down, to deal with threats. Additionally, the deck includes a few threats of its own, including Murmuring Mystic and Thorn of the Black Rose, to apply pressure when needed."
