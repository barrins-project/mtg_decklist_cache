Mulldrifter serves as a key card to draw additional cards, while Sunscape Familiar and God-Pharaoh's Faithful provide mana advantage and defensive capabilities. The deck also includes a mix of counterspells and cantrips to control the game and dig for key pieces of the combo."

The deck also includes card draw spells like Thoughtcast to maintain a steady flow of resources. To enhance the creatures' power and toughness, the deck utilizes All That Glitters. The mana base consists of artifact lands and various bridges to ensure a smooth mana curve. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with early creature presence and deal damage efficiently."
