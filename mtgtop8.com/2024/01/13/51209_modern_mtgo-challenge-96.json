The deck also includes interaction with cards like Dead / Gone and Fire / Ice to control the board and disrupt opponents. With the addition of cards like LÃ³rien Revealed and Tishana's Tidebinder, the deck aims to maintain card advantage and tempo. Overall, the deck focuses on overwhelming the opponent with a mix of aggression and control using the Cascade mechanic."
