The deck includes powerful creatures like Stalactite Stalker and Dauthi Voidwalker, which can deal significant damage quickly. It also includes disruptive cards like Opposition Agent and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's plans and remove key cards from their hand. Additionally, the deck has tools for acceleration, removal, and graveyard recursion. The goal is to establish board control and maintain pressure on the opponent while disrupting their strategy."

This combo is supported by cards like Goblin Welder, Goblin Engineer, and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker to search for and recur the necessary pieces. Additional disruption is provided by cards like Pyroblast, Red Elemental Blast, and Opposition Agent. The deck is built around the Legacy format, utilizing powerful cards like Mox Opal, Ancient Tomb, and Urza's Saga to generate mana efficiently. Supporting cards like Lotus Petal and Goblin Engineer help accelerate the combo and create favorable board states."

The deck aims to stall the opponent's game plan by countering their key spells with Force of Will and Spell Pierce, while also removing threats with Swords to Plowshares and Prismatic Ending. The deck also focuses on card selection and card draw with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Narset, Parter of Veils. The deck has a flexible win condition with Murktide Regent and Comet, Stellar Pup providing a threat to close out the game."
