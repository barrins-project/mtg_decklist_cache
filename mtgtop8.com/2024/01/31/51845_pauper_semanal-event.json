The deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total by playing inexpensive creatures like Kitchen Imp and Voldaren Epicure, while also utilizing burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast to deal direct damage. Additionally, the deck includes discard spells like Faithless Looting to generate card advantage and improve the chances of drawing relevant cards. This aggressive approach is supported by a mana base that enables fast and consistent casting of spells."
