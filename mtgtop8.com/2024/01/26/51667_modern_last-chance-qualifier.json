Fable of the Mirror-Breaker allows for additional damage and card advantage. Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger provide powerful threats. The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push, Lightning Bolt, and Terminate to deal with opposing threats.

The deck also includes a mix of removal spells like Fatal Push, Terminate, and Lightning Bolt to efficiently deal with opposing threats. Thoughtseize provides valuable information and disrupts the opponent's hand. Finally, the mana base is designed to provide consistent access to both black and red sources of mana for efficient casting of spells and creatures."
