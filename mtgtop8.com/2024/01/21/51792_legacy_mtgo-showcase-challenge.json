Once your library is empty, you can use a Dread Return to bring back Thassa's Oracle and win the game. The deck also includes various card selection and protection spells, such as Brainstorm, Ponder, Force of Will, and Teferi, Time Raveler, to help you find the combo pieces and defend your game plan."

The key concept of this deck is to gain control of the game through a combination of counter spells, removal, and card advantage. It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining card advantage through powerful card selection and filtering effects like Brainstorm and Ponder. By efficiently removing threats and countering key spells, the deck aims to stall the game until it can deploy its win condition, the powerful creature Murktide Regent."
