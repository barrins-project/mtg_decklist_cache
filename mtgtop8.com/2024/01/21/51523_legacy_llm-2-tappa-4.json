Additionally, the deck includes powerful reanimation spells like Reanimate, as well as disruptive creatures like Opposition Agent. Overall, the deck aims to create a fast, disruptive, and graveyard-focused aggro strategy."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively disrupt the opponent's mana base and control their resources using powerful prison-style cards. It utilizes fast mana sources like Ancient Tomb and City of Traitors to accelerate into disruptive artifacts such as Chalice of the Void and Trinisphere. It also employs land destruction effects like Blood Moon, Magus of the Moon, and Shatterskull Smashing to punish opponents heavily reliant on non-basic lands. The deck aims to apply early pressure with efficient creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Fury, while also having access to removal and burn spells like Unlicensed Hearse and Broadside Bombardiers."
