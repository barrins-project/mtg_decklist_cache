The deck aims to control the game by countering spells with cards like Force of Negation and Force of Will, while manipulating its own draws with Brainstorm and Ponder. It also includes removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Terminus to deal with threat cards. Additionally, the deck includes cards that generate card advantage and value, such as Yorion, Sky Nomad and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. The mana base is designed to provide access to multiple colors for maximum flexibility."

The deck utilizes cards like Aether Vial, Goblin Lackey, and Muxus, Goblin Grandee to cheat goblins into play and generate massive board presence. Battle Cry Goblin, Broadside Bombardiers, and Twinshot Sniper provide additional damage and removal options. The deck also includes disruption with cards like Munitions Expert and Wasteland to slow down the opponent's strategy. The deck aims to maintain a fast and aggressive pace throughout the game, taking advantage of the goblin synergy to secure victory."
