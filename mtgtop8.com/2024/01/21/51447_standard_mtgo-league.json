The deck focuses on utilizing cards like Crawling Chorus, Skrelv's Hive, and Skrelv, Defector Mite to generate a large number of creatures. Venerated Rotpriest and Jawbone Duelist provide additional aggression and damage. The deck also includes spells like Serum Snare, Experimental Augury, and Bring the Ending for control and removal purposes. The deck utilizes a mix of basic lands and dual lands to ensure consistent mana production."
