The deck also includes artifact synergy with cards like Hangarback Walker and Urza's Saga, allowing for explosive token generation. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a horde of powerful, counter-boosted creatures."

The main goal is to maximize land drops and generate extra mana through the use of Amulet of Vigor and the bounce lands (such as Simic Growth Chamber). This deck runs powerful ramp cards like Arboreal Grazer and Dryad of the Ilysian Grove to accelerate into big threats like Primeval Titan. The deck also includes utility lands like Boseiju, Who Endures and Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion to protect and enhance its creatures. The goal is to assemble the necessary lands and win through the combo of Amulet Titan."

It focuses on controlling the board and hand, while applying constant pressure with efficient threats. The deck also includes some removal spells like Fatal Push, Terminate, and Lightning Bolt to deal with opposing threats, and has some late-game finishers like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger to seal the game."
