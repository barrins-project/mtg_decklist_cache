The focus is on quickly reducing the opponent's life total by playing multiple threats each turn and efficiently using burn spells to control the board. The deck also includes a few cards that provide card advantage and deck manipulation to maintain momentum. Overall, the strategy of this Red Deck Wins archetype is to apply constant pressure on the opponent and deal direct damage to quickly win the game."
