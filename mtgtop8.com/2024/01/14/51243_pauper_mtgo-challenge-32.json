The deck also utilizes cheap removal spells like Cast Down and Tolarian Terror to deal with opponent's threats. It aims to generate a large graveyard to fuel the delirium mechanic and enable the use of cards like Crawl from the Cellar and Fallaji Archaeologist. The deck includes a mix of creatures, spells, and land to create a well-rounded control strategy."

The main strategy is to play cheap artifact creatures like Myr Enforcer and Somber Hoverguard, and then use cards like Krark-Clan Shaman and Deadly Dispute to generate value and create advantageous board states. The deck also includes a number of artifact lands, like Seat of the Synod and Great Furnace, to ensure a steady flow of artifacts on the battlefield. Overall, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of powerful artifact creatures."
