This is achieved through a combination of cards like Dark Ritual, Rite of Flame, and Lion's Eye Diamond, which provide additional mana acceleration. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Infernal Tutor, Burning Wish, and Arclight Phoenix to search for specific combo pieces, generate card advantage, and deal damage to the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to create a storm of spells and overwhelm the opponent with sheer speed and efficiency."
