It combines cards like Ephemerate and Archaeomancer to repeatedly flicker key creatures, such as Mulldrifter, to draw extra cards and control the board. The deck also includes spells like Skred and Counterspell to handle threats and maintain control. Additionally, it utilizes flicker effects to disrupt the opponent's land base by using Cleansing Wildfire. By constantly flickering creatures and disrupting the opponent's strategy, this deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
