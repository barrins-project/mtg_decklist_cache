It utilizes a combination of cards like Picklock Prankster and Baral, Chief of Compliance to generate card advantage and enable faster combo setups. Otherworldly Gaze, One with the Multiverse, and Dig Through Time provide card selection and digging capabilities to find key combo pieces efficiently. The ultimate goal is to reach a board state where Omniscience is activated, allowing for powerful and game-winning plays. Cards like Abuelo's Awakening and Faithful Mending further support the combo strategy by providing additional card draw and graveyard manipulation. Considering the versatility of Mastermind's Acquisition, the deck is designed to adapt and have answers to various situations."

            "notes": "This deck revolves around the combination of Squirming Emergence and Harald Unites the Elves to create a powerful combo. The goal is to play Squirming Emergence, allowing you to mill your own deck and create a large graveyard. Harald Unites the Elves then allows you to bring back multiple creatures from your graveyard, generating a significant advantage. The deck also includes supporting cards such as Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Moritte of the Frost to further enhance the combo. Thoughtseize and Commune with the Gods provide additional control and card selection."
