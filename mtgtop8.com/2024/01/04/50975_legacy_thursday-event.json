By using Goblin Engineer and Goblin Welder, you can easily search for and bring these combo pieces back from the graveyard. Fable of the Mirror-Breaker also helps with this strategy by providing additional copies of Painter's Servant. The deck also includes a control element with cards like Pyroblast and Red Elemental Blast to disrupt opponents' strategies. Additionally, Karn, the Great Creator provides utility and can shut down opponents' artifacts. Overall, the key concept is to assemble the Painter's Servant and Grindstone combo while controlling the game."
