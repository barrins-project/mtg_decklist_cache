The deck focuses on using cards like Faerie Mastermind, Spyglass Siren, and Tishana's Tidebinder to manipulate and control the opponent's creatures, while cards like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor provide powerful late-game threats. The deck also includes some utility lands like Otawara, Soaring City and Takenuma, Abandoned Mire to enhance its overall strategy."
