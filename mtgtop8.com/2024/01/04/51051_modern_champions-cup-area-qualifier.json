The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's graveyard with Dauthi Voidwalker and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger. It contains a mix of removal spells like Terminate and Lightning Bolt to handle threats, and it can also punish opponents with a Blood Moon. Overall, it focuses on quick aggression and disruption to gain an advantage and control the game."

The deck also includes cards with multiple useful modes, such as Subtlety and Bonecrusher Giant, to provide flexibility in different game situations. Additionally, there are counterspells like Force of Negation and Lórien Revealed to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The land base is optimized to provide the necessary color mana sources for the deck's spells."

By cycling through cards like Curator of Mysteries, Street Wraith, and Architects of Will, the deck aims to fill the graveyard with creatures. Once a critical mass is reached, the player can cast Living End to bring all the creatures back onto the battlefield at once, while simultaneously clearing the opponent's board. The deck also utilizes cards like Grief and Force of Negation to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain control."
