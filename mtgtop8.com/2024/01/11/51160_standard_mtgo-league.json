The deck includes a mix of creatures that can deal damage, control elements like counterspells, and powerful creatures. The goal is to maintain a low mana curve and consistently have threats on the board to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The deck also utilizes a combination of blue and black cards to provide versatility in dealing with various threats."

The deck focuses on early aggression and board presence with low-cost creatures like Mirrex, Harbin, Vanguard Aviator, and Knight-Errant of Eos. It also includes cards like Resolute Reinforcements and Recruitment Officer to provide additional creatures and strengthen the board. The deck utilizes evasion and protection with cards like Faerie Mastermind and Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a quick and efficient aggressive strategy while maintaining control of the board."
