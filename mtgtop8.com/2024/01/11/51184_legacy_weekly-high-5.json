The deck utilizes a combination of efficient creatures like Orcish Bowmasters, Murktide Regent, Dragon's Rage Channeler, and Delver of Secrets, coupled with a suite of control spells including Molten Collapse, Lightning Bolt, Force of Will, and Daze. The goal is to apply constant pressure while disrupting the opponent's strategy, ultimately overwhelming them and securing victory. The deck also features card filtering and selection tools like Ponder, Brainstorm, and Mishra's Bauble to improve consistency."
