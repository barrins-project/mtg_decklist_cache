By utilizing cards like Archon of Emeria, Anointed Peacekeeper, and Solitude, the deck aims to hinder opponents' strategies while being able to apply pressure with creatures like Caves of Chaos Adventurer and Seasoned Dungeoneer. The deck also incorporates a strong mana base with cards like Simian Spirit Guide, Lotus Petal, and Ancient Tomb to facilitate quick plays and enable powerful spells such as Chrome Mox and Chalice of the Void."
