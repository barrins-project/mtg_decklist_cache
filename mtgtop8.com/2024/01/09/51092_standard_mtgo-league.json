Leyline Binding is used to restrict the opponent's options and limit their ability to make plays. Atraxa, Grand Unifier and Archangel of Wrath provide additional control elements and can disrupt the opponent's game plan. Sunfall is a key tool for wiping the opponent's board and gaining an advantage. Depopulate helps deal with wide boards. The deck also has strong ramp and mana fixing with Up the Beanstalk, Cavern of Souls, and Boseiju, Who Endures.
