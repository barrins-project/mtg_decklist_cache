The deck focuses on using Candy Trail, Expedition Map, and Filigree Familiar to search for and play these lands efficiently. Additionally, it includes various removal spells such as Fiery Cannonade, Rolling Thunder, and Lightning Bolt to control the opponent's creatures. The deck also features creatures like Crimson Fleet Commodore, Oliphaunt, Self-Assembler, and Boarding Party to provide threats and maintain board presence. The inclusion of Volcanic Spite and Smoldering Crater offers additional removal options and potential reach for the deck."
