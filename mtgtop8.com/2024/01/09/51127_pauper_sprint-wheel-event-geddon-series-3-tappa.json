It relies on low-cost creatures with flying like Snaremaster Sprite, Faerie Seer, and Faerie Miscreant, as well as efficient interaction with Counterspell and Snap. Moon-Circuit Hacker and Ninja of the Deep Hours provide card advantage and additional damage. The deck also includes tools like Of One Mind for card draw and Smoke Shroud for added evasion. With a focus on tempo and evasion, this deck aims to quickly establish board presence and apply pressure to win the game."
