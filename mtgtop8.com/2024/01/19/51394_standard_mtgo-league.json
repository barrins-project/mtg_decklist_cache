It uses creatures like Zephyr Sentinel and Werefox Bodyguard to maintain board presence and control. The deck also includes cards like Make Disappear and Resolute Reinforcements to disrupt the opponent's plans and further strengthen the board. The inclusion of Recruitment Officer and Knight-Errant of Eos allows for the deck to quickly refill its hand and keep up the pressure. With a mix of efficient creatures and disruptive spells, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."
