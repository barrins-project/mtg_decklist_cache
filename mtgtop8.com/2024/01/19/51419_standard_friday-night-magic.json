The deck aims to apply relentless pressure by constantly attacking with creatures and casting burn spells to both remove threats and deal direct damage. The inclusion of cards like Feldon, Ronom Excavator, Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance, and Mishra's Foundry provide additional value and options to maintain the aggression and maximize the deck's potential."
