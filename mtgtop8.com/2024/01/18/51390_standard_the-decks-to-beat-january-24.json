Cards like Annex Sentry and Crawling Chorus provide early aggression, while Skrelv, Defector Mite and Venerated Rotpriest add resilience and value to the deck. The deck also includes control elements with cards like Serum Snare and Fading Hope to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to consistently apply pressure and control the battlefield."
