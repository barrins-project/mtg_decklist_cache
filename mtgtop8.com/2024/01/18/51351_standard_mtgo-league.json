            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to build an aggressive strategy using creatures with abilities that can disrupt and control the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to quickly establish a strong board presence with cards like Venerated Rotpriest, Skrelv's Hive, and The Seedcore. It also incorporates removal spells like Serum Snare and Fading Hope to keep the opponent's creatures in check. Additionally, the deck includes cards like March of Swirling Mist and Experimental Augury to generate card advantage and maintain momentum. Overall, the key concept is to rapidly apply pressure while maintaining control over the game."
