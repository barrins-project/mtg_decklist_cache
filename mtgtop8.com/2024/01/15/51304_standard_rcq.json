The deck aims to flood the board with small creatures such as Dennick, Pious Apprentice, Spyglass Siren, Tishana's Tidebinder, and Warden of the Inner Sky. It also includes cards like Subterranean Schooner and Make Disappear to help protect and enable the aggro strategy. The deck utilizes removal spells like Destroy Evil to clear the path for its creatures. Additionally, it benefits from the synergy of Virtue of Loyalty and Wedding Announcement to boost its offensive capabilities. The land choices support a mix of efficient mana production and synergistic utility."
