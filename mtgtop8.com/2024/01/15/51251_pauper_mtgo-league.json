The deck utilizes artifact lands like Ancient Den and Great Furnace for mana acceleration, and includes Springleaf Drum for additional mana generation. All That Glitters and Wrenn's Resolve enhance the power and resilience of the deck's creatures, and the inclusion of land cards like Rustvale Bridge and Silverbluff Bridge help with mana fixing. Reckless Impulse and Razortide Bridge provide additional card draw options for added consistency."

It also aims to maintain board presence with Murmuring Mystic and Azure Fleet Admiral. The deck includes a mix of removal spells, card draw/filtering options, and win conditions to adapt to different situations and strategies."
