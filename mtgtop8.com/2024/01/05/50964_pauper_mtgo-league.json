Cards like Lead the Stampede and Distant Melody help to refill the hand and maintain card advantage. Timberwatch Elf is a key card, allowing the player to pump up their Elves and deal massive damage. Overall, the deck aims to utilize the synergy and speed of Elves to dominate the game."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by constantly destroying their creatures and generating card advantage through effects like Deadly Dispute and Ichor Wellspring. It also utilizes sacrifice effects like Fanatical Offering and Crypt Rats to clear the board and gain an advantage. The deck's win conditions include Avenging Hunter, Troll of Khazad-dÃ»m, and Thorn of the Black Rose. The deck also has some utility lands like Bojuka Bog and Witch's Cottage to further disrupt the opponent's plans."
