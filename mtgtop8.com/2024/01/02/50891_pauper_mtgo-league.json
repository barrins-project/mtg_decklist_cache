This allows players to cast multiple spells per turn and overwhelm their opponents with a swarm of elves. The deck also includes card draw spells like Lead the Stampede, Winding Way, and Distant Melody to keep the player's hand full. The deck utilizes Timberwatch Elf to pump up the power of other elves, while Masked Vandal provides some removal options."
