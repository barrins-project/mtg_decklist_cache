By using cards like Acorn Harvest and Gnaw to the Bone, the deck aims to generate a large number of creatures and life gain, while also filling the graveyard. Cards like Dread Return and Scrapwork Mutt are used to reanimate powerful creatures like Lotleth Giant and Troll of Khazad-dûm. The deck aims to outpace opponents by quickly filling the board with creatures and overwhelming them with sheer numbers and power."

It focuses on early game board presence with creatures like Augur of Bolas and Murmuring Mystic, as well as burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Skred. The deck also utilizes card filtering and selection through Brainstorm and Ponder to find answers and maintain a consistent game plan. It aims to control the opponent's actions through counter spells like Counterspell and Dispel, while utilizing Lórien Revealed and Tolarian Terror to gain card advantage and disrupt the opponent's strategy."
