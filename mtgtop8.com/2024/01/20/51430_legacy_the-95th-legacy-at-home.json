The deck aims to play low-cost creatures like Dragon's Rage Channeler, Orcish Bowmasters, and Delver of Secrets to quickly apply pressure on the opponent. Alongside the creatures, the deck utilizes efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Unholy Heat to eliminate threats. It also includes counterspells like Daze and Force of Will to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The presence of Mishra's Bauble and Brainstorm allows for card filtering and maintaining a consistent hand. The deck also features land destruction with Wasteland to further disrupt the opponent's mana base."

It aims to lock the opponent out of casting spells through cards like Blood Moon, Magus of the Moon, and Chalice of the Void. Additionally, the deck utilizes quick mana acceleration with cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Chrome Mox to deploy threats like Goblin Rabblemaster and Bonecrusher Giant. It also takes advantage of land destruction with cards like Shatterskull Smashing and Caves of Chaos Adventurer to further disrupt the opponent's game plan."
