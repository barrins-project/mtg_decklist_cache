Overall, the deck aims to apply consistent pressure and maintain tempo to overwhelm opponents."

It focuses on utilizing powerful creatures like Murktide Regent and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to control the board and apply pressure. The deck also incorporates disruptive spells like Daze, Fatal Push, and Force of Will to counter and remove threats. It utilizes a mix of fetch lands and Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's mana base and limit their options. Overall, the deck aims to outlast and outvalue the opponent through efficient control and resource management."
