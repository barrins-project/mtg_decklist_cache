The inclusion of cards like Seal of Strength and Titanic Growth provide additional ways to boost the power of the creatures, while cards like Fog and Carnivorous Canopy provide protection and removal options."

Additionally, there are a few other cards that provide utility and support for the combo, such as Prismatic Strands and Dizzy Spell."
