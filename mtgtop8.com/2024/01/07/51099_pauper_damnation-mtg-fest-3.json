Additionally, the deck includes various artifact lands and mana acceleration cards to ensure a smooth and efficient gameplay. The overall goal is to quickly deal damage to the opponent and win the game before they can establish their own strategy."

The land base is a mix of Plains, Orzhov Basilica, Swamp, and a few utility lands for additional support."
