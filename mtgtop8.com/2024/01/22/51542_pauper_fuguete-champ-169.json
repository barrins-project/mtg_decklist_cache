These creatures are complemented by support cards such as Tithing Blade and Lembas to increase their power and effectiveness. The deck also includes removal spells like Cast Down and Unmake to handle opposing threats. Additionally, there are cards like Omen of the Dead and Indoctrination Attendant to provide recursion and card advantage. The mana base includes Bojuka Bog for graveyard hate and Scoured Barrens for lifegain. Overall, the key concept is to apply pressure and disrupt opponents using a streamlined, low-cost creature strategy with Orzhov color identity."
