The deck also includes high-powered threats (Murktide Regent, Leovold, Emissary of Trest) to quickly close out the game once control is established. Additionally, the deck has a small toolbox of utility cards (Mystic Sanctuary, Sheoldred's Edict) and removal spells (Murderous Cut, Fatal Push) to deal with specific threats."

The deck aims to quickly bring out high-impact threats like Misty Rainforest and Murktide Regent while also keeping the opponent on the backfoot with disruptive spells like Snuff Out and Brazen Borrower. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to aggressively exploit the power of Death's Shadow through reanimation and control."
