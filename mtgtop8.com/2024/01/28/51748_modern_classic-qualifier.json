It also focuses on card advantage through spells like Preordain and Snapcaster Mage, allowing the player to maintain a steady stream of resources. The inclusion of Murktide Regent provides a threat that can quickly close out the game if left unanswered."

The deck aims to establish a board presence early with aggressive creatures like Zabaz, the Glimmerwasp and Walking Ballista, while also utilizing Urza's Saga to search for artifacts that synergize with the strategy. The inclusion of cards like Ancients Stirrings and Cragcrown Pathway further enhance the deck's consistency and flexibility. Overall, the deck seeks to overwhelm opponents with a swarm of powerful creatures bolstered by an abundance of counters."

Additionally, the deck uses cards like Thoughtseize, Grief, and Dauthi Voidwalker to disrupt the opponent's hand and graveyard, preventing them from effectively executing their strategies. Overall, the key concept of the deck is to aggressively attack the opponent while simultaneously disrupting their game plan."

The deck aims to control the board state by countering opponent's spells and removing threats with cards like Unholy Heat and Lightning Bolt. It also focuses on card advantage and selection with Preordain and Expressive Iteration. The deck's win condition revolves around the powerful creatures Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Murktide Regent, which can quickly overwhelm the opponent. Ledger Shredder acts as additional disruption by forcing opponents to discard cards."

The deck focuses on creating a strong board presence with Urza's tokens and Thopter Foundry while disrupting the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Metallic Rebuke. It also utilizes cards like Stoneforge Mystic and Portable Hole to search for and remove threats from the opponent's side. The deck aims to maintain control of the game and outvalue the opponent with its artifact synergy and powerful card interactions."
