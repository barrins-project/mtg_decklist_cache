By utilizing a variety of auras like Cartouche of Solidarity, Gryff's Boon, and All That Glitters, the deck aims to pump up its creatures, making them more powerful and difficult to deal with. Additionally, cards like Aqueous Form and Sentinel's Eyes provide evasion and card draw, further enhancing the deck's aggression and card advantage. The inclusion of Sram, Senior Edificer and Light-Paws, Emperor's Voice allows for card draw and the potential to equip multiple auras per turn."
