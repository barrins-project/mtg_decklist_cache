Chalice of the Void helps control the opponent's spells, while Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Syr Ginger, the Meal Ender provide recurring value and disruption. Thoughtcast provides card draw, while Force of Will offers protection. The deck also utilizes some artifact creatures like Patchwork Automaton and Kappa Cannoneer for additional damage and utility."
