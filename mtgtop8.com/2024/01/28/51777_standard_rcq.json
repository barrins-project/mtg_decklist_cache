The key concept revolves around using cards like Up the Beanstalk and Herd Migration to quickly ramp up mana and play big threats like Topiary Stomper and Archangel of Wrath. Leyline Binding and Invasion of Zendikar provide additional control elements by limiting opponent's options and generating advantage. The inclusion of Atraxa, Grand Unifier and Tishana's Tidebinder further enhances the control aspect by providing additional ways to manipulate the board state. Overall, the deck aims to establish dominance through strong creatures and control elements."
