The deck also includes cards like Gyruda, Doom of Depths and Beanstalk Giant for additional synergies and to further enhance the combo potential. The aim is to generate card advantage and overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence."

The key concept is to generate and gain a significant amount of life through cards like Aetherflux Reservoir, Lunarch Veteran, and Prosperous Innkeeper. This life gain is further supported by Wildgrowth Walker. The deck also utilizes Chord of Calling and Collected Company to search for key combo pieces and maintain board presence.
