By casting spells with Cascade, such as Violent Outburst and Crashing Footfalls, the deck can quickly generate a board presence and apply pressure. The inclusion of cards like Shardless Agent and LÃ³rien Revealed further enhance the consistency and efficiency of cascading into impactful spells. The deck also features a strong counter package with Force of Will, Force of Negation, and Mystical Dispute to protect its game plan. Overall, the deck aims to be an aggressive force in Legacy, leveraging the power of Cascade to overwhelm opponents."
