The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's mana base while quickly putting out threats like Goblin Rabblemaster and Broadside Bombardiers to pressure the opponent. The inclusion of Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker provide additional damage and control options, while Den of the Bugbear offers a resilient creature source."

The win condition revolves around playing Timeless Dragon and Phyrexian Dreadnought, which work well together to provide a powerful and resilient threat.
