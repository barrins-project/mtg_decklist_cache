The deck also includes cards like Arboreal Grazer and Dryad of the Ilysian Grove to ramp up the amount of lands it can play. The goal is to use Primeval Titan's ability to fetch lands like Vesuva and Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle to deal large amounts of damage to the opponent."

The deck also includes support cards like Waker of Waves and Generous Ent to provide additional value and control options. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful graveyard-based combo."

It also utilizes cards like Repeal, Force of Negation, and Warping Wail to further control the board and protect its own resources.

By using Chord of Calling and Diabolic Intent, the player can search for specific creatures, such as Blood Artist, Orcish Bowmasters, and Delighted Halfling, to create a synergistic board state. The deck also incorporates ramp creatures like Wall of Roots and Arboreal Grazer to accelerate mana, and includes lands like Misty Rainforest and Verdant Catacombs for deck thinning and color fixing. The inclusion of Boseiju, Who Endures protects important combo pieces from counterspells."
