The deck includes a mix of creatures, removal spells, and disruption cards to control the board and maintain the pressure on the opponent. The goal is to quickly build a strong board presence and deal significant damage to the opponent's life total. The deck utilizes efficient creatures like Mosswood Dreadknight and Deep-Cavern Bat, along with removal spells like Go for the Throat and Tear Asunder, to dominate the battlefield and secure victory."
