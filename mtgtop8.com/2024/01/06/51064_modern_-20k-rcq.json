The inclusion of cards like The One Ring, Urza's Saga, and Tolaria West provide additional utility and search options.

Key cards like The One Ring, Urza's Saga, and Summoner's Pact add additional combo potential and search capabilities. The deck also includes a mix of different lands and utility cards like Expedition Map, Valakut, and Boseiju to support its combo strategy."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by countering their spells, removing their threats, and generating card advantage through cards like Snapcaster Mage and Tishana's Tidebinder. The deck also incorporates some aggressive elements with cards like Flam of Anor and Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and fetch lands are included to thin the deck and improve card drawing consistency."

The deck aims to quickly establish a board presence with creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Orcish Bowmasters, while also utilizing cards like Grief and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck includes powerful finishers like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker to close out games. The deck also includes a selection of removal spells like Terminate and Lightning Bolt to control the board."
