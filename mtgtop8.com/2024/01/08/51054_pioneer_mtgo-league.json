            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly and aggressively bring out Arclight Phoenix, a powerful creature that can be revived from the graveyard. The deck includes various low-cost spells like Sleight of Hand, Lightning Axe, and Fiery Impulse to help trigger the Phoenix's revival ability. It also includes card draw spells like Opt and Treasure Cruise to maintain hand advantage and allow for consistent phoenix revivals. The deck includes a few disruptive cards like Spell Pierce and Spikefield Hazard to hinder opponents' strategies. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with the recurring presence of Arclight Phoenix and maintain aggressive pressure."
