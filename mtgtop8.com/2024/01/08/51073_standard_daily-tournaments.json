It focuses on controlling the board with cards like Cut Down, Go for the Throat, and Molten Collapse, while also having powerful threats such as Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Trumpeting Carnosaur. The deck also incorporates graveyard synergy with Bonehoard Dracosaur and Deep-Cavern Bat. Additionally, it utilizes a variety of lands to ensure consistent mana sources and maximize its aggressive potential."
