The deck aims to maintain card advantage and card selection with cards like Omen of the Sea and Memory Deluge. It also focuses on disruption and delaying tactics through cards like Get Lost and Temporary Lockdown. The deck includes a strong late-game potential with the inclusion of Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Yorion, Sky Nomad, providing additional value and card advantage."
