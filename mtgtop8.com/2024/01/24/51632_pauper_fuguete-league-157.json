The deck aims to maintain board control through the use of damage spells like Lightning Bolt, Electrickery, and Unholy Heat, while also generating card advantage through spells like Reckless Impulse and Candy Trail. Additionally, the deck includes a mix of creatures like Mogg War Marshal and The Autonomous Furnace to provide additional board presence and pressure. Overall, the deck focuses on overwhelming the opponent through efficient control and resource management."
