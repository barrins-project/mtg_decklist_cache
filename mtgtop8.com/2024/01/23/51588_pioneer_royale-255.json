The deck focuses on using mana dorks like Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves to accelerate its mana, allowing for powerful plays early in the game. Cards like Bishop of Wings, Giada, Font of Hope, and Righteous Valkyrie provide resilience and lifegain, while Skyclave Apparition and Kayla's Reconstruction offer removal and utility. With a combination of Collected Company and efficient creatures, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and finish the game quickly."
