The deck focuses on early aggression with low-cost creatures like Annex Sentry, Skrelv, Defector Mite, and Jawbone Duelist. It also utilizes spells like Bring the Ending and Charge of the Mites to remove threats and deal damage. March of Swirling Mist provides additional creature tokens to maintain pressure. The inclusion of Fading Hope and Serum Snare adds control elements, while the use of lands like Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire and Otawara, Soaring City enhance the deck's overall strategy."
