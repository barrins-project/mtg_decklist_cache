By utilizing cards like Arbor Elf and Utopia Sprawl to ramp up mana early, the deck can quickly flood the board with threats like Eldrazi Repurposer and Avenging Hunter. Additionally, cards like Writhing Chrysalis and Annoyed Altisaur provide disruption and removal options, while Jewel Thief can provide card advantage. The deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and apply pressure to the opponent before they can stabilize."
