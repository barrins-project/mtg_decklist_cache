The deck also includes burn spells like Play with Fire and Atarka's Command to finish off opponents or take out key threats. By curving out with fast creatures and using burn spells for reach, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents and close out games before they can stabilize. With a mix of creature-heavy threats and burn spells, the deck is designed to apply constant pressure and force opponents to react defensively."
