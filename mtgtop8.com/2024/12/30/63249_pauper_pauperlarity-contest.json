By utilizing a combination of ramp creatures like Arbor Elf and Utopia Sprawl, as well as powerful threats like Annoyed Altisaur and Avenging Hunter, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Writhing Chrysalis and Malevolent Rumble provide additional ways to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Wild Growth and Boarding Party help to increase the deck's overall speed and consistency."
