By utilizing the Azorius colors, it combines aggression with control elements, such as counterspells and tap effects. The key strategy is to establish early board control, disrupt opponents' plans, and maintain pressure with evasive creatures. Additionally, the inclusion of artifacts and lands that can provide additional value helps to ensure that the deck maintains consistency and resilience in longer games."

The inclusion of counterspells like Phantom Interference and removal spells like Go for the Throat and Cut Down help to control the board and protect your creatures.
