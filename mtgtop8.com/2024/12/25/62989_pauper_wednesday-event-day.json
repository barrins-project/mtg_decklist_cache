It includes creatures like Ghitu Lavarunner and Voldaren Epicure to apply early pressure, supported by cards like Searing Blaze and Thermo-Alchemist for additional damage. The deck's goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero using direct damage spells and creature attacks, while also maintaining card advantage through efficient card draw and burn spells."
