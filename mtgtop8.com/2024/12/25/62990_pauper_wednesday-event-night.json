By buffing up creatures like Glistener Elf and Ichorclaw Myr with spells like Mutagenic Growth and Embiggen, the deck aims to deal damage fast and efficiently. Blight Mamba provides a resilient threat while cards like Snakeskin Veil and Vitality Charm help protect key creatures. The goal is to establish board presence early and maintain pressure on the opponent until victory is achieved."
