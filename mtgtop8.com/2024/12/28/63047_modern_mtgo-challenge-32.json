By utilizing cards like Fatal Push and Force of Negation to control the board and Murktide Regent and Abhorrent Oculus to apply pressure, the deck aims to control the pace of the game and outvalue opponents. The inclusion of card draw effects like Thought Scour and Consider allows the player to dig deeper into their deck for crucial answers while also fueling graveyard synergies. The deck's strength lies in its ability to adapt to various matchups and dominate through efficient resource management."

It includes a mix of counterspells, removal spells, and planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria to control the tempo of the game. The inclusion of companions like Kaheera, the Orphanguard provides additional value and synergy with the deck's creatures. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and provide consistency in casting spells. The overall strategy is to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through careful resource management and efficient removal."
