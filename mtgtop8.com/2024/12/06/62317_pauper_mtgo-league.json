The deck also includes ways to draw cards, protect key pieces, and gain life to prolong the game.

The deck also aims to drain the opponent's life with Gray Merchant of Asphodel and maintain card advantage with Phyrexian Rager and Sign in Blood. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Thorn of the Black Rose and Crypt Rats provide added versatility and control options to outmaneuver the opponent in a 1 vs 1 matchup."

This allows the player to use their other combo pieces like Valakut Invoker or Secret Door to deal damage to their opponent or win the game in another way. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to dig through the deck to find the necessary pieces to assemble the combo."
