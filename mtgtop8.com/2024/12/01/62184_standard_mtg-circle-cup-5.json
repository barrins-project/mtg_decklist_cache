Using a mix of removal spells and hand disruption, the deck aims to control the game until it can fully take over with its high-impact creatures like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Archfiend of the Dross. The deck also includes multiple ways to recur and gain advantage from these creatures, such as Unholy Annex / Ritual Chamber and Glissa Sunslayer. Overall, the key strategy of this deck is to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."

Caustic Bronco and Glissa Sunslayer provide additional threats, while cards like Duress and Anoint with Affliction disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck aims to maintain board control with removal spells like Go for the Throat and Cut Down, while using Unholy Annex / Ritual Chamber to generate additional value. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy, with a mix of lands that enable quick creature deployment while ensuring consistency in mana production."

Omniscience is a key card that allows you to cast spells for free, giving you a major advantage. Atraxa, Grand Unifier and Overlord of the Hauntwoods provide additional control and threats on the board. Utilizing a mix of mana fixing and utility lands, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful spells and creatures."
