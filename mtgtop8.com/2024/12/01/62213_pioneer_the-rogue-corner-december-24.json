It utilizes a mix of different lands to ensure mana consistency and protection against countermagic. Key cards like Overlord of the Boilerbilges, Overlord of the Hauntwoods, and Overlord of the Mistmoors provide major threats while Flicker of Fate and Leyline Binding offer versatility and removal options. The additional cards like Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines and Yorion, Sky Nomad further enhance the control aspect of the deck."
