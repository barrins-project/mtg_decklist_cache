By utilizing cards like Ichor Wellspring and Refurbished Familiar, as well as spells like Deadly Dispute and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and spells. The affinity mechanic allows the deck to play out its threats quickly and synergize with sacrifice effects, providing a fast-paced and aggressive playstyle."
