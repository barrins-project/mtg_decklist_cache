The synergy between cheap creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and pump spells like Monstrous Rage allows for explosive turns that can close out the game swiftly. With a focus on direct damage and efficient creatures, this deck is designed to race ahead and secure victories before the opponent can stabilize."
