By utilizing cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Thalia's Lieutenant to disrupt the opponent's plans, while buffing up your own creatures with Brave the Elements and Adeline, Resplendent Cathar, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and pressure the opponent into making suboptimal plays. The inclusion of creatures like Veteran Survivor and Coppercoat Vanguard provides additional resilience and staying power in longer games. Ultimately, this deck aims to win by out-tempoing and out-valuing the opponent."
