By utilizing burn spells like Play with Fire, Skewer the Critics, and Wizard's Lightning, the deck can quickly deplete the opponent's life total. With cards like Light Up the Stage and Monstrous Rage, the deck can maintain card advantage and pump up its creatures for additional damage. The inclusion of Den of the Bugbear and Ramunap Ruins provides additional reach and threats to close out the game efficiently."
