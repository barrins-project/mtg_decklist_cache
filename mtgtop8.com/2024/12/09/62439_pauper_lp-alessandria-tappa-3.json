By utilizing cards that create Eldrazi Spawn tokens and deal direct damage, the deck aims to close out the game quickly. The mix of low-cost creatures and burn spells allows for a fast-paced and aggressive playstyle, aiming to take control of the game early on and maintain pressure on the opponent. Additionally, the deck includes cards that provide additional utility and support to keep up the aggressive momentum."
