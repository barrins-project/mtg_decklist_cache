The deck also includes control elements like Counterspell and Spell Pierce to protect the combo, while also using cards like Faithless Looting and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student to dig for combo pieces. The deck has a toolbox approach with cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Pithing Needle for flexibility. Overall, the focus is on efficiently assembling and protecting the combo to win the game."

By using cards like Faithless Looting, Lava Dart, Lava Spike, and Lightning Bolt, the deck is able to fill the graveyard with spells and bring back Arclight Phoenix for consistent damage output. The deck also includes fast creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage to apply pressure early on. The key strategy is to be aggressive and overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and creatures."

The deck also includes cards like Counterspell and Lightning Bolt for control and removal, as well as card draw and manipulation with Preordain and Mishra's Bauble. Overall, the deck aims to quickly set up and execute the combo while controlling the game and disrupting the opponent's plans."
