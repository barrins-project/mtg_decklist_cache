It aims to control the board with removal spells like Fatal Push and Bloodchief's Thirst, while also using discard spells such as Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The key strategy is to grind out incremental advantage through resource denial and attrition, eventually overwhelming the opponent with powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil. The deck also has a land package that synergizes well with the control elements and helps generate additional value."
