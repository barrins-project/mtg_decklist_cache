It includes ways to control the opponent's board with removal spells like Fatal Push and Thoughtseize, while also utilizing cards like Case of the Stashed Skeleton and Torch the Tower for additional value. The inclusion of Jegantha as a companion provides additional consistency and mana fixing. Overall, the deck aims to efficiently assemble its combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan to secure a victory."

Additionally, Otawara, Soaring City can provide additional flying threats to close out the game."
