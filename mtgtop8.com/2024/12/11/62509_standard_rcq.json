Through a combination of counterspells, removal, and card draw, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and prevent them from executing their game plan effectively. With a mix of control elements and finishers like Jace, the Perfected Mind and Doomsday Excruciator, the deck seeks to dictate the pace of the game and secure victory through attrition and strategic decision-making."
