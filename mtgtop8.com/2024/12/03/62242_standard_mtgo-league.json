By combining evasive threats like Spyglass Siren and Faerie Mastermind with powerful removal like Go for the Throat, the deck aims to apply pressure early and keep the opponent on the back foot. With a mix of tempo plays and card advantage engines, the deck looks to overwhelm opponents and secure victory through a combination of aggression and control."
