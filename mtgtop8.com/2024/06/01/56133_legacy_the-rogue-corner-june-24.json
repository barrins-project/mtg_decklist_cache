The deck aims to generate mana quickly with Ancient Tomb and Dark Ritual, while also controlling the board with Defense Grid. The main win condition is to cast Mind's Desire to create a storm count and then use Grapeshot to finish off the opponent. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Echo of Eons and Entomb for added flexibility."
