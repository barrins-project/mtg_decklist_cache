Additionally, using cards like Graveyard Trespasser and Glissa Sunslayer allows for additional value and recursion, while cards like Liliana of the Veil provide extra disruption. The deck's mana base is designed to support its aggressive strategy, with a mix of dual lands and utility lands to ensure consistency and flexibility."

The inclusion of cards like Duress and Long Goodbye helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan, allowing the aggressive creatures to continue their assault uninterrupted. Additionally, the mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements while also providing enough consistency for aggressive plays."

It utilizes cards like Memory Deluge and Temporary Lockdown to outvalue the opponent and maintain control throughout the game.
