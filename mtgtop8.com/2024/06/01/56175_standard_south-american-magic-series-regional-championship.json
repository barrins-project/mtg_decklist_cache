The deck includes cards that can exile threats, counter spells with flashback, draw multiple cards, and search for specific cards. Additionally, the deck includes land destruction and protection cards to further control the board. The key strategy is to outlast opponents by denying them resources and slowly gaining card advantage until the control player can take full control of the game."
