It also disrupts the opponent's plans with counterspells like Spell Pierce and removal spells like Fatal Push. The deck aims to control the game while steadily decreasing the opponent's resources, ultimately winning through milling rather than traditional combat damage. It also benefits from card draw spells like Visions of Beyond to continue fueling its mill strategy."

By combining the aggressive creatures with powerful removal spells like Fatal Push and Thoughtseize, it aims to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent. The key strategy is to apply pressure early with creatures like Grief and Solitude while disrupting the opponent's game plan. The deck also utilizes powerful creatures like Phelia and Phlage to close out the game quickly. Overall, the deck aims to be proactive and assert dominance on the battlefield."
