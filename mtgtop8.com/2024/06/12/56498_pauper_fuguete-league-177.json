By using cards like Winding Way and Lead the Stampede to dig through the deck, players can find their key combo pieces such as Persistent Petitioners and Mirrorshell Crab. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a large number of creatures and use abilities like Generous Ent's to generate tokens for a decisive attack. The deck also includes graveyard recursion with Gnaw to the Bone, ensuring a steady stream of resources to maintain pressure on the opponent."
