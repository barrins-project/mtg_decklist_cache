Wedding Announcement and Virtue of Loyalty provide additional creature support, while Sorin the Mirthless and Aclazotz, Deepest Betrayal offer additional utility and disruption. The deck aims to overwhelm and outpace opponents with a mix of efficient creatures and removal spells, while maintaining a strong battlefield presence to close out games quickly."
