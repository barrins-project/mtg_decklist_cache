This enables you to build up a storm count for powerful finishers like Grapeshot or Ral, Monsoon Mage. Additionally, cards like Past in Flames and Wish provide flexibility and the ability to recur key spells from your graveyard. The deck focuses on casting spells efficiently and chaining them together to overwhelm your opponent and win the game in a single explosive turn."
