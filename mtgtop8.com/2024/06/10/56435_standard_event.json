            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the game by using counterspells, card draw, and removal spells to prevent the opponent from executing their game plan. The deck includes cards that allow you to manipulate the opponent's hand and board state, while also providing card advantage and ways to stabilize the game. The win condition of the deck is to outvalue the opponent through incremental advantages and eventually overwhelm them with powerful threats like The Wandering Emperor and Jace, the Perfected Mind. The mana base is designed to support the control elements of the deck while providing consistency in casting spells."
