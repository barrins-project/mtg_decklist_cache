Mwonvuli Acid-Moss and Thermokarst help disrupt the opponent's mana base while Generous Ent provides card advantage.

The goal is to overwhelm the opponent quickly by buffing up these creatures and dealing large amounts of damage in a short amount of time. The deck utilizes a low mana curve, allowing for fast and explosive starts, with the potential to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
