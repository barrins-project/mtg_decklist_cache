The key strategy is to play low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Phoenix Chick to pressure the opponent, while also utilizing burn spells like Lightning Strike and Obliterating Bolt to remove threats or finish off the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Squee, Dubious Monarch and Charming Scoundrel for card advantage and consistency. The goal is to win the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
