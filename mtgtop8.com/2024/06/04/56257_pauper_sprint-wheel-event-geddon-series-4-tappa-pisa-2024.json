Boomerang and L√≥rien Revealed are used for tempo advantage and to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes card draw and self-mill effects to fuel the graveyard for cards like Tolarian Terror and Murmuring Mystic. Overall, this Mono Blue Aggro deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain control of the game through efficient spells and creatures."
