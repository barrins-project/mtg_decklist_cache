The inclusion of Questing Druid and Kumano Faces Kakkazan provide additional threats and ways to reach the opponent. Slickshot Show-Off and Monstrous Rage give the deck additional reach and damage potential. The mana base includes lands that can produce both red and green mana efficiently to support the aggressive strategy."
