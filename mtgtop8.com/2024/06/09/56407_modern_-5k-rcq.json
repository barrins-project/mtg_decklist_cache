The deck also utilizes graveyard recursion with Sheoldred's Edict and Winter Moon to maintain board presence. The mana base includes a mix of fetchlands and utility lands to ensure consistent mana production. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt and pressure the opponent to secure a fast victory."

It leverages cards like Mishra's Bauble and Soul-Scar Mage for card advantage and deals damage efficiently with Lightning Bolt and Mutagenic Growth. The deck also utilizes Dragon's Rage Channeler for card selection and Slickshot Show-Off for direct damage. With a focus on speed and aggression, this deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
