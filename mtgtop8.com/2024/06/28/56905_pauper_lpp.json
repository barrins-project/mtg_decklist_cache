By disrupting the opponent's game plan through removal and countering key threats, the deck aims to slow down the game and gain card advantage through effects like Thought Scour and Deep Analysis. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Gurmag Angler serves as a win condition to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. The deck's mana base includes various lands to support consistent control of the game."
