Writhing Chrysalis and Malevolent Rumble provide removal options, while Llanowar Visionary and Generous Ent offer card advantage. Avenging Hunter and Annoyed Altisaur bring big threats to the board, supported by Colossal Dreadmask for a finishing blow. This Mono Green Aggro deck aims to beat down the opponent before they have a chance to set up their defenses."
