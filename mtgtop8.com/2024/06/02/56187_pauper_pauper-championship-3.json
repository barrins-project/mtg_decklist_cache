By playing multiple Slivers that grant bonuses to each other, the deck aims to build a strong board presence and put pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way to help replenish the hand with more creatures. With a mix of creatures and support cards, the deck aims to swarm the opponent and win the game through sheer numbers and efficient use of the Sliver synergies."
