The key strategy is to create a deadly combo with cards like Prologue to Phyresis and Vivisurgeon's Insight to maximize the poison damage and win the game swiftly."

The inclusion of Fiery Temper, Galvanic Blast, and Lightning Bolt allows for additional damage to be dealt to both creatures and the opponent directly. Faithless Looting and Deadly Dispute provide card draw and recursion, while Alms of the Vein and Vampire's Kiss offer additional life gain to sustain the aggression. Highway Robbery is included as a powerful finisher, ensuring victory in the late game. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive strategy, allowing for consistent plays and efficient mana usage."
