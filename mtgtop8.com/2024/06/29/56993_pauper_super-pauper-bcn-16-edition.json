Gnaw to the Bone helps to gain life while filling the graveyard, and cards like Blanchwood Prowler and Rubblebelt Maverick provide additional threats to the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and efficient reanimation strategy."

It includes cards that generate value through sacrificing artifacts and drawing cards, while also disrupting the opponent's graveyard strategies. Removal spells are included to control the opponent's threats, while the deck can also burn the opponent out with direct damage. The deck's mana base is streamlined to support its artifact-heavy strategy and ensure consistent casting of its spells."

Utilizing cards like Lightning Bolt, Galvanic Blast, and Goblin Grenade, along with low-cost creatures like Goblin Blast-Runner and Voldaren Epicure, this deck aims to apply constant pressure to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Kuldotha Rebirth and Experimental Synthesizer allows for additional early game plays and synergies. With a focus on speed and direct damage, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
