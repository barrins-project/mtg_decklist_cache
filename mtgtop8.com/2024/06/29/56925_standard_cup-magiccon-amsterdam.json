The key strategy is to play aggressively with low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Questing Druid, supported by powerful combat tricks like Monstrous Rage and Play with Fire. The inclusion of burn spells like Lightning Strike and Kumano Faces Kakkazan allows for direct damage to the opponent, while cards like Snakeskin Veil and Slickshot Show-Off provide protection and removal options. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creature beatdown and burn spells."
