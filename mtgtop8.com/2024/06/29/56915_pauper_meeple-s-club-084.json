It also utilizes cheap counterspells like Spell Pierce, Force Spike, and Counterspell to protect its threats. Card draw spells like Brainstorm, Thought Scour, and Deep Analysis help maintain a steady stream of cards. Boomerang can disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Lose Focus and Artful Dodge provide additional tricks. LÃ³rien Revealed enhances the deck's overall efficiency, allowing for swift and powerful plays."
