By utilizing cards like Archive Trap, Fractured Sanity, Ruin Crab, and Hedron Crab, you can mill your opponent's cards into their graveyard. This strategy is supported by control elements such as Fatal Push, Drown in the Loch, and Surgical Extraction to disrupt your opponent's game plan. Tasha's Hideous Laughter provides a finisher by potentially exiling your opponent's entire graveyard. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with mill effects while controlling the board and disrupting their hand."
