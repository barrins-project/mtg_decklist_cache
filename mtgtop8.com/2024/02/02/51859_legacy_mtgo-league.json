The deck also utilizes card advantage and selection with Brainstorm and Ponder, as well as ramp with Up the Beanstalk. Its win condition is Murktide Regent, a powerful threat that can take over the game if left unchecked."

It focuses on using efficient and disruptive spells like Lightning Bolt, Force of Will, and Daze to disrupt opponents' strategies while utilizing cards like Dragon's Rage Channeler and Murktide Regent to apply pressure. The deck also utilizes card filtering and card draw through Ponder, Brainstorm, and Mishra's Bauble to ensure consistency and maximize its options. Through a combination of aggressive creatures, efficient removal spells, and disruptive elements, the deck aims to seize control of the game and secure victory."
