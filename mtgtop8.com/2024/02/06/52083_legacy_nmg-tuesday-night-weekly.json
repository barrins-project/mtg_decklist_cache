            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to control the game by disrupting the opponent's plans and maintaining a strong position on the board. This is achieved through a combination of countering spells with Force of Will and Daze, removing threats with Fatal Push and Murderous Cut, and hindering the opponent's mana base with Wasteland. The deck also emphasizes card advantage and card selection with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Leovold, Emissary of Trest. The main win condition is Murktide Regent, which can quickly close out the game if left unanswered."
