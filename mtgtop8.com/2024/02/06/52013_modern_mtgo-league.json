It achieves this by utilizing cards that deal direct damage, such as Lightning Bolt and Lava Dart, as well as creatures with abilities that boost their power, like Dragon's Rage Channeler and Soul-Scar Mage. The deck also incorporates cards that provide card advantage and help with deck manipulation, such as Mishra's Bauble and Preordain. The inclusion of Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion allows for additional ramp and flexibility in casting spells. Overall, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent and secure a victory."
