The deck aims to quickly generate mana with cards like Skirk Prospector and Simian Spirit Guide while utilizing the Battle Cry Goblin and Broadside Bombardiers to deal substantial damage. The Goblin Chieftain, Goblin Matron, and Goblin Rabblemaster provide additional support and synergies with other goblin creatures. The deck also includes disruptive elements such as Blood Moon and Shatterskull Smashing to hinder opponents. The combination of strong goblin creatures and efficient mana generation allows for a relentless and explosive offense."
