The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with huge creatures and powerful effects early in the game, before they have a chance to respond effectively. The combination of fast graveyard filling, reanimation spells, and disruptive cards like Unmask and Grief creates a powerful combo strategy focused on putting pressure on the opponent."
