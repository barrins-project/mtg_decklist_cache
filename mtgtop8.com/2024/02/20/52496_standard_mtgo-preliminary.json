The key strategy is to control the board early with efficient removal like Go for the Throat and Cut Down, while also utilizing bounce effects like Make Disappear to disrupt the opponent's tempo. Sheoldred and Malcolm provide powerful creatures that can quickly end the game if left unchecked, while Faerie Mastermind and Spyglass Siren offer additional disruption and card advantage. Ertai Resurrected can help protect key threats, while the land base provides a consistent mix of colors for optimal casting."

The deck includes cards that can generate advantage by manipulating the opponent's deck and disrupting their strategy. It also includes cards that can provide additional benefits when certain conditions are met, such as having specific creatures on the battlefield or controlling certain types of lands. Overall, the deck aims to control the tempo of the game and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient creatures and disruptive spells."
