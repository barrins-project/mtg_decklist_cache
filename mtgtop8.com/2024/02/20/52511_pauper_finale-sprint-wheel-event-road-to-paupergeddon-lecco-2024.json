The deck aims to maintain pressure through evasive threats like Ninjas and Faeries, while also drawing cards efficiently with Cantrips and card advantage spells. The deck seeks to win the game by overwhelming the opponent with fast and aggressive plays, controlling the board state, and gaining card advantage to outvalue the opponent."
