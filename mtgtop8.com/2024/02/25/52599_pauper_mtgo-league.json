By efficiently utilizing mana and creatures that can attack immediately upon entering the battlefield, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and relentless assault. The inclusion of various burn spells adds additional reach and flexibility to the deck's game plan, allowing it to close out games quickly and efficiently before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
