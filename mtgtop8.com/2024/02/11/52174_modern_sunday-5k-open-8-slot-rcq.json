The inclusion of Crashing Footfalls provides a constant stream of free creatures, putting pressure on the opponent to keep up. The land base is built to support the deck's color requirements and provide utility with cards like Boseiju, Who Endures and Gemstone Caverns."

            "notes": "This deck aims to utilize a toolbox of creatures to create a combo strategy. The key concept revolves around using Chord of Calling and Eldritch Evolution to search for specific creatures like Yawgmoth, Thran Physician and Grist, the Hunger Tide. These creatures provide powerful effects, such as sacrificing and manipulating counters, which can be used to generate value and control the board. The deck also includes various utility creatures and lands to support the combo strategy and ensure consistency. Overall, the main goal is to assemble the right combination of creatures to execute a winning combo."
