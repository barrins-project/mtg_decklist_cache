The mana base ensures consistent access to different colors of mana, allowing for the flexibility to play a variety of spells."

The deck also benefits from the synergy between Dryad of the Ilysian Grove and The One Ring, providing additional land drops and card advantage. The deck aims to assemble a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful lands and creatures."

By playing cards like Shardless Agent and Violent Outburst, the deck can cascade into cards like Crashing Footfalls and Lórien Revealed, which provide a strong board presence. The deck also includes Leyline of the Guildpact and Leyline Binding to protect its creatures, while Subtlety provides additional control against opposing threats. The mana base includes a variety of dual lands to ensure the deck can cast its spells efficiently. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive and explosive plays."

This mana is then used to play big threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The deck also includes various artifacts, such as Chromatic Sphere and Expedition Map, to help assemble the Tron lands quickly. Control elements like Oblivion Stone and Dismember are used to handle threats from the opponent, while Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon provide additional utility and board control options."
