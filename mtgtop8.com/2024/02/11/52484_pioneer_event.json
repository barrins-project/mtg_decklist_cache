The deck then looks to utilize the sacrifice synergy between cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods, Mayhem Devil, and Woe Strider to control the board and deal damage. Collected Company helps to find more creatures, while Bolas's Citadel can provide a powerful finisher. The deck also includes cards like Catacomb Sifter and Outland Liberator for additional value and synergy."
