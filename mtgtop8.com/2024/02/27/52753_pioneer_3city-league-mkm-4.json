With cards like Adeline, Resplendent Cathar, Thalia's Lieutenant, and Kytheon, Hero of Akros, this deck focuses on quickly building up a strong board presence and applying pressure early in the game. The inclusion of cards like Anointed Peacekeeper and Dauntless Bodyguard also provide protection for key creatures, ensuring that this deck can maintain its aggressive pace throughout the match."
