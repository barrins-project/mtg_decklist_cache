The key strategy is to control the board early with removal spells like Go for the Throat and make use of efficient creatures like Trumpeting Carnosaur and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse to apply pressure and close out the game. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Bloodtithe Harvester and Corpse Appraiser for additional value and to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The land base supports the deck's mana requirements and ensures consistent plays."
