These creatures are then pumped up with enchantments like All That Glitters, Ethereal Armor, and Hyena Umbra to make them bigger threats. The deck also includes protection spells like Emerge Unscathed and Benevolent Blessing to keep your creatures safe. Using a combination of small creatures and powerful auras, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a relentless and aggressive strategy."
