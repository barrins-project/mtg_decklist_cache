The deck also includes burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast to clear the way for attacks. The mana base allows for quick deployment of threats and includes synergistic lands like Rustvale Bridge and Ancient Den. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy while maintaining some flexibility with cards like Kor Skyfisher and Wedding Invitation."

The deck also includes control elements like Arms of Hadar and Candy Trail to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, there are card draw and recursion options like Ancient Stirrings and Revive the Shire to maintain card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to control the game early on and finish with powerful late-game threats."
