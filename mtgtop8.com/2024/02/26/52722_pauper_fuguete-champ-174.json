The strategy revolves around applying pressure early on with efficient threats like Serrated Scorpion and Okiba Reckoner Raid, while utilizing direct damage spells like Bump in the Night and Sovereign's Bite to finish off the opponent. The deck also includes some lifegain cards to help survive longer matchups, allowing for a more aggressive playstyle. The mana base is designed to support the deck's low curve and maintain consistency in casting spells."
