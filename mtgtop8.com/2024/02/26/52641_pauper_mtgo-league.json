By leveraging artifact creatures and token generators, combined with direct damage spells, it aims to close out games swiftly and efficiently. The key strategy is to constantly apply pressure and force the opponent to react defensively while maintaining a steady stream of damage output. The deck's reliance on speed and aggression makes it a formidable opponent in the Pauper format."
