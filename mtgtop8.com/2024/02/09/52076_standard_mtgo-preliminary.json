The deck includes cards like Destroy Evil, Get Lost, and No More Lies to control the opponent's creatures and disrupt their resources. Wedding Announcement and Virtue of Loyalty provide additional support and card advantage. The deck also includes creatures such as The Wandering Emperor, Spyglass Siren, and Faerie Mastermind to apply pressure and continue disrupting the opponent. The mana base is well-rounded with a mix of Islands, Adarkar Wastes, Deserted Beaches, and Seachrome Coasts to provide consistent access to all necessary colors."
