The deck focuses on synergy between cards such as Crawling Chorus, Skrelv's Hive, and Skrelv, Defector Mite to generate a large number of creatures. The deck also includes spells like Bring the Ending and Serum Snare to remove threats from the opponent's side of the board. The deck aims to maintain a strong board presence and put pressure on the opponent throughout the game."
