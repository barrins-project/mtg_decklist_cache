Additionally, the deck includes countermagic in the form of Metallic Rebuke to protect its threats and disruption in the form of Thoughtcast to maintain card advantage. This aggressive strategy is supported by mana acceleration from cards like Springleaf Drum and the artifact lands."

By utilizing cards like Springleaf Drum and Metallic Rebuke, the deck aims to consistently play multiple creatures per turn and protect them with counterspells. Thoughtcast allows for card draw to keep up the momentum, while All That Glitters enhances the power and toughness of the creatures. The inclusion of Shadow Rift and Saiba Cryptomancer gives the deck some evasion and extra utility."
