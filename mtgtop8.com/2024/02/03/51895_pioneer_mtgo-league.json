It includes a mix of low-cost interaction spells, card filtering, and discard outlets. The goal is to cast multiple spells in a turn, triggering the Phoenix's ability to return from the graveyard, and deal massive damage to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Ledger Shredder and Picklock Prankster helps to facilitate this strategy by enabling additional spell-casting or graveyard manipulation. The deck also includes some counterspells and utility lands to provide additional control and flexibility during gameplay."
