It aims to control the board by eliminating opposing threats and establishing its own presence. The deck utilizes a mix of powerful creatures like Deep-Cavern Bat and Raffine, Scheming Seer, alongside disruptive spells like Go for the Throat and Make Disappear. It also includes land cards that provide additional benefits, such as Restless Anchorage and Raffine's Tower. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its aggressive creatures and efficient removal spells."

Liliana of the Veil provides disruption and control elements. The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Cut Down and Bitter Triumph, while also utilizing cards like Tenacious Underdog and Evolved Sleeper to maintain resilience and card advantage. Mishra's Foundry and Phyrexian Fleshgorger provide additional utility and synergy in the deck. Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor, and Takenuma, Abandoned Mire offer additional strategic options."

The deck utilizes cards like Farewell, Destroy Evil, Get Lost, and Temporary Lockdown to remove or delay the opponent's creatures. It also includes cards like Jace, the Perfected Mind, Quick Study, and Memory Deluge to draw extra cards and maintain card advantage. The deck aims to control the board state and eventually win the game through cards like Sunfall and The Wandering Emperor. The mana base is built to support this control strategy with a mix of lands that produce white and blue mana."

This is achieved through the use of control spells such as Leyline Binding and Invasion of Zendikar to limit the opponent's options. The deck also focuses on generating resources and mana with cards like Herd Migration and Topiary Stomper. Additionally, the deck includes powerful creatures like Archangel of Wrath and Atraxa, Grand Unifier to provide threats and maintain board presence. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's plans while building its own advantage and controlling the game."
