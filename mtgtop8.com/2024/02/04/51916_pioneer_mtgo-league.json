It also features efficient removal spells like Fiery Impulse and Lightning Axe to deal with threats while maintaining momentum. The inclusion of Hall of Storm Giants and Otawara, Soaring City provides additional utility and options for the deck. Overall, the deck focuses on speed, graveyard synergy, and consistent threats to overwhelm opponents."

The deck focuses on gaining life and generating value through cards like Wildgrowth Walker, Prosperous Innkeeper, and Lunarch Veteran. Collected Company and Chord of Calling are used to search for key combo pieces and provide additional value. The deck also includes Return to the Ranks to retrieve creatures from the graveyard. The mana base is a combination of green, white, and black sources, allowing for flexible casting of spells. Ultimately, the goal is to set up a board state where Amalia Benavides Aguirre can gain enough life to activate Aetherflux Reservoir and deal massive damage to the opponent."
