Additionally, the deck has a few counterspells like Spell Pierce to interact with the opponent and protect its combo, as well as cards like Forge Anew and Surge of Salvation as alternate win conditions. The deck also incorporates Urza's Saga for additional artifact tutoring and ramp."

The One Ring and Urza's Saga further enhance the deck's ability to generate mana and find key pieces. With the ability to tutor creatures with Summoner's Pact and control the board with cards like Spelunking, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its powerful creatures and land-based combos."
