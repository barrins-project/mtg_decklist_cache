The deck relies on using removal spells like Cast Down and Defile to keep the opponent's creatures in check, while utilizing cards like Deadly Dispute, Fanatical Offering, and Ichor Wellspring to sacrifice and draw more cards. The inclusion of Khalni Garden and Lembas further helps to generate tokens for defense and additional sacrifice fodder. The deck also features strong finishers like Avenging Hunter and Troll of Khazad-dûm to close out the game."

The deck aims to assemble the combo of Freed from the Real and Axebane Guardian, allowing the player to untap Axebane Guardian multiple times and generate an increasing amount of mana. This mana can then be used to fuel powerful spells or activate abilities of other creatures in the deck. The deck also includes card draw and creature search to ensure consistency in finding the combo pieces."
