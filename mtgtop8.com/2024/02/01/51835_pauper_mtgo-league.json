The deck includes a mix of creature cards such as Militia Bugler, Thraben Inspector, Kor Skyfisher, Lunarch Veteran, and Squadron Hawk to apply early pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes card advantage and protection tools like Raffine's Informant, Prismatic Strands, and Journey to Nowhere. The aim is to generate a large board presence quickly and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures while minimizing their ability to fight back."
