            "notes": "This deck focuses on the aggressive strategy of utilizing Arclight Phoenix as the main threat. The key concept revolves around cycling through the deck quickly to enable the recurring presence of the Phoenix. The deck achieves this by including spells such as Consider, Opt, and Sleight of Hand to dig through the library. It also features cards like Fiery Impulse and Lightning Axe to control the opponent's board state. Additionally, the deck includes disruptive elements with Jwari Disruption and Spell Pierce to protect its game plan. The overall goal is to overwhelm the opponent with the relentless return of Arclight Phoenix while maintaining card advantage with Treasure Cruise."
