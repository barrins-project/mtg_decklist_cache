The deck also includes disruption elements like Subtlety and Dead / Gone to control the opponent's board, while also utilizing versatile cards like Fire / Ice and Tishana's Tidebinder for additional card advantage and removal. This aggressive Cascade strategy is enhanced by the land choices, such as Boseiju, Who Endures, to ensure the successful casting of critical spells."

Scion of Draco and Leyline of the Guildpact increase the deck's power level and make the cascade hits even more devastating. Additionally, having access to countermagic like Force of Negation and Subtlety provides some protection. The deck includes a variety of lands to ensure consistent colors of mana for casting the spells. Overall, the strategy revolves around overwhelming the opponent with powerful spells and maintaining board presence."

The deck also includes disruption elements with cards like Force of Negation and Subtlety to prevent the opponent from stabilizing. Additionally, there are a few versatile removal options like Fire/Ice and Dismember to deal with threats. Overall, the deck aims to maintain aggressive pressure while disrupting the opponent's strategy."

By playing cards like Shardless Agent and Violent Outburst, the deck is able to cast additional spells for free, including Crashing Footfalls which creates 4/4 Rhino tokens. This allows the deck to quickly flood the board with threats and overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Subtlety and Tishana's Tidebinder to control the opponent's board and disrupt their game plan. Overall, the deck aims to win the game quickly and decisively by leveraging its Cascade abilities."

The deck then utilizes control elements such as Oblivion Stone, Relic of Progenitus, and Warping Wail to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain board control. It also includes powerful threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Wurmcoil Engine to close out the game. Additionally, the deck has card selection through Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying to find the necessary pieces to execute its strategy."
