The deck aims to quickly cycle through its cards using cards like \"Architects of Will\" and \"Curator of Mysteries\" to set up the graveyard. Once the graveyard is filled, the deck uses cards like \"Violent Outburst\" and \"Generous Ent\" to cascade into a \"Living End\" and bring all creatures from the graveyard back onto the battlefield. This combo can quickly overwhelm the opponent and result in a game-winning board state. The inclusion of cards like \"Grief\" and \"Waker of Waves\" adds disruption and control to the deck, making it versatile and flexible in various matchups."

By using cards like Arboreal Grazer and Simic Growth Chamber, the deck aims to generate large amounts of mana and land drops. This allows for explosive turns where Primeval Titan is played and searches for powerful lands like Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Kessig Wolf Run. The deck also utilizes Urza's Saga to search for key artifacts like The Mycosynth Gardens and Expedition Map, further boosting its combo potential."

This allows the player to potentially generate a large number of powerful creatures or game-winning spells. The deck also includes various control elements such as Spell Pierce and Teferi, Time Raveler to protect the combo and disrupt opponent's strategies."
