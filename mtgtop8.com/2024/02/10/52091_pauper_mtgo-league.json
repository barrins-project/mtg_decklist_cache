The deck focuses on playing low-cost creatures like Lunarch Veteran, Thraben Inspector, Squadron Hawk, Kor Skyfisher, Raffine's Informant, Militia Bugler, and Dawnbringer Cleric to quickly build a board presence. It also includes cards like Prismatic Strands and Guardians' Pledge for protection and increased damage output. Additionally, Battle Screech provides token generation, while Journey to Nowhere offers removal options. The deck utilizes a mana base of mostly Plains, with a few Idyllic Grange lands for additional utility and one Mana Tithe for added surprise disruption."
