The deck focuses on utilizing a variety of Goblins as well as artifact synergies to deal quick, efficient damage. Cards like Goblin Bushwhacker, Voldaren Epicure, and Goblin Tomb Raider help to flood the board with threats, while Lightning Bolt, Galvanic Blast, and Fireblast provide direct damage spells to remove opposing creatures or finish off opponents. The inclusion of artifacts like Implement of Combustion and Experimental Synthesizer further enhances the deck's overall strategy."
