The deck focuses on playing low-cost creatures with abilities that generate value, such as Novice Inspector and Warden of the Inner Sky. It also includes cards like Resolute Reinforcements and Warleader's Call to provide additional creatures and strengthen the board presence. The deck utilizes combat tricks like Knight-Errant of Eos and Witchstalker Frenzy to dominate the battlefield. Additionally, it incorporates removal spells like Gleeful Demolition to control the opponent's board. The deck relies on a mix of Plains and Mountain lands to provide the necessary mana."
