By leveraging cards like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent alongside a suite of cantrips and counterspells, the deck aims to maintain tempo advantage and pressure the opponent into making suboptimal plays. By combining cheap threats with disruptive spells, the deck seeks to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent in order to secure a swift victory."
