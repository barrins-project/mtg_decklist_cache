The goal is to generate a large amount of mana and then use it to draw cards, search for specific cards, or cast spells. The deck includes various wall creatures, such as Drift of Phantasms, Shield-Wall Sentinel, and Wall of Roots, which can generate mana or protect the player. Additionally, there are cards like Quirion Ranger and Crashing Drawbridge that can untap lands, allowing for additional mana generation."
