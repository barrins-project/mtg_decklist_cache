It capitalizes on disrupting the opponent's strategy with disruptive creatures like Grief and Orcish Bowmasters, while also protecting its game plan with counterspells like Force of Will and efficient card draw like Brainstorm and Ponder. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures like Griselbrand and Archon of Cruelty, while also utilizing cards like Entomb and Reanimate to bring them back from the graveyard multiple times throughout the game."
