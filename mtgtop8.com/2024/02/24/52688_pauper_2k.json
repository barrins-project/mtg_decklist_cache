The synergy between cards like Delver of Secrets and Tolarian Terror allows for aggressive plays while disruptive spells like Counterspell and Spell Pierce provide protection. The deck also includes card draw to maintain momentum and ensure a consistent flow of threats. Overall, the strategy of Mono Blue Aggro is to apply early pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining card advantage."

The deck includes a mix of efficient removal spells like Cast Down and Spinning Darkness, along with creature threats like Avenging Hunter and Troll of Khazad-dûm. By utilizing cards like Crypt Rats and Tithing Blade, the deck aims to clear the board and maintain control while utilizing sacrifice outlets like Deadly Dispute and Fanatical Offering to gain advantage. The deck also includes some recursion with cards like Thorn of the Black Rose and Ichor Wellspring."
