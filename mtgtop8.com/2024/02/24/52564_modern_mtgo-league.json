It aims to control the game with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Wrench Mind, combined with removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember. The strategy is to chip away at the opponent's life total with creatures like Grief and Orcish Bowmasters, while also utilizing cards like The Rack and Bontu's Last Reckoning to finish the game quickly. The deck also has a subtheme of graveyard interaction with cards like Dauthi Voidwalker and Lazav, Wearer of Faces."
