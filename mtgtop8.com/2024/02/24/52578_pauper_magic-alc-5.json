With a mix of evasive creatures like Akroan Skyguard and Sentinel's Eyes, as well as protection spells like Karametra's Blessing and Benevolent Blessing, this deck aims to go wide and hit fast to bring down the opponent's life total. The strategy is to build a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure throughout the game to secure a quick victory."
