The deck focuses on quickly dealing damage to the opponent's life total by playing efficient creatures like Bloodthirsty Adversary and Monastery Swiftspear, as well as using spells like Lightning Strike and Play with Fire to finish them off. The deck also includes cards like Squee, Dubious Monarch and Feldon, Ronom Excavator for card advantage and resilience. The goal is to maintain pressure on the opponent and win the game before they can stabilize."
