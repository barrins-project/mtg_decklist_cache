The key strategy revolves around setting up the graveyard with cards like Careful Study, Thought Scour, and Pieces of the Puzzle, while also generating mana quickly with Dark Ritual and Lotus Petal. Using Exhume and Dread Return, the deck can then bring creatures like Troll of Khazad-d√ªm, Ulamog's Crusher, and Thorn of the Black Rose back onto the battlefield. The deck also includes countermagic and discard spells to disrupt opponents and protect its own combo pieces."
