Collector's Vault helps generate additional mana and card advantage. Kaito Shizuki provides additional card selection. Thoughtseize helps disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck includes several high-cost creatures such as Emrakul, Ulamog, and Otawara for more win conditions. The land base supports the deck's color requirements and includes some utility lands like Undercity Sewers."

This mana is then used to cast powerful green creatures such as Voracious Hydra and Old-Growth Troll, as well as planeswalkers like Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner and Vivien, Arkbow Ranger. The inclusion of Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider further enhances the devotion to green and amplifies the impact of the mana generated. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures and efficient mana production."
