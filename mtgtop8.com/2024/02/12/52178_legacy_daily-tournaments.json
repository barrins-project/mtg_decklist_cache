            "notes": "The key concept of this Legacy 1 vs 1 Control - Stiflenought deck is to create a powerful board presence by quickly playing Phyrexian Dreadnought while preventing the opponent's plays through control cards like Force of Will, Spell Snare, and Stifle. The deck also focuses on card advantage and selection with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. Additionally, the deck disrupts the opponent's strategy through cards like Doorkeeper Thrull and Torpor Orb. It utilizes a mana base that includes dual lands like Tropical Island and Tundra for flexibility and consistency."
