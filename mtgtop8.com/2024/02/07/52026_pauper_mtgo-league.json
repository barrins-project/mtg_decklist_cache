            "notes": "The deck focuses on combining flicker effects and card advantage to generate value and disrupt opponents. It uses cards like Archaeomancer, Ephemerate, and Mulldrifter to repeatedly flicker creatures and draw additional cards. The deck also includes countermagic like Counterspell and Dispel to protect its combo pieces and disrupt opponents' strategies. Additionally, it includes cards like Cleansing Wildfire and Rustvale Bridge to disrupt opponents' mana bases. Overall, the key concept of the deck is to create a loop of flickering creatures and gaining card advantage to control the game and eventually win through a combo or overwhelming advantage."
