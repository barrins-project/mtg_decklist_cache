Along with this, the deck utilizes card draw spells like Preordain and Brainstorm to ensure it has the right answers at the right time. The deck also includes creatures like Ninja of the Deep Hours and Spellstutter Sprite to provide additional control elements and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
