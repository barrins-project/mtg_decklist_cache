The deck also focuses on card advantage and manipulation, with spells like Memory Deluge and Siphon Insight allowing the player to draw additional cards or search the opponent's library. The land base is built to support the control strategy, with a mix of dual lands and utility lands to ensure efficient mana production and disruption of the opponent's resources."
