            "notes": "The main focus of this UW Control deck is to disrupt and control the opponent's game plan through counterspells, removal, and card advantage. Key cards such as Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Memory Deluge provide card advantage and board control, while counterspells like Dovin's Veto and Censor help prevent the opponent from resolving threats. The deck also includes a few win conditions like The Wandering Emperor and Hall of Storm Giants to finish off the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through careful resource management and controlling the tempo of the game."
