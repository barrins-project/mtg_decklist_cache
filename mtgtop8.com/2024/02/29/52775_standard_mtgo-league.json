            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressive tactics with a mix of Dimir creatures and spells. By combining evasion abilities with creature removal and disruptive elements, it aims to quickly overwhelm opponents and control the pace of the game. The inclusion of powerful legendary creatures such as Gix, Lazav, and Sheoldred give the deck additional versatility and threats. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive game plan while also providing the necessary colors for the deck's spells. Ultimately, the goal is to deal damage quickly and efficiently while disrupting the opponent's strategies."
