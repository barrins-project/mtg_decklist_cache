The deck includes cards that buff your creatures, generate tokens, and deal direct damage to the opponent. By efficiently deploying threats and pressuring the opponent's life total, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize or set up their own game plan. The mana base includes lands that help cast your spells more reliably and ensure a smooth curve of plays."
