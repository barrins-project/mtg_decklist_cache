It aims to disrupt opponents with Leyline of Sanctity and Leyline of the Guildpact, while also ramping up to powerful threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The deck's win condition is to overpower opponents with big creatures and powerful planeswalkers, while keeping the opponent's resources in check with various control elements."
