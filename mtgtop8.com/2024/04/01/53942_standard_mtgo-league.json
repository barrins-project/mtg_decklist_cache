The key strategy is to efficiently use low-cost creatures and spells to apply pressure early in the game, while also having options for card advantage and additional damage to finish the game swiftly. By combining efficient creatures, removal spells, and combat tricks, the deck aims to establish control of the battlefield and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize or mount a successful defense."
