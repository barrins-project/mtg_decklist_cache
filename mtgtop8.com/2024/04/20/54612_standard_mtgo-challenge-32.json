The key strategy revolves around using cards like Tinybones, the Pickpocket and Duelist of the Mind to chip away at the opponent's hand size, while cards like Restless Anchorage and Deep-Cavern Bat provide a consistent source of damage. No More Lies and Go for the Throat are used to deal with opposing threats, while Lord Skitter, Sewer King and Faerie Mastermind offer additional creature-based disruption. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggro and disruption."

Cards like Resolute Reinforcements and Warleader's Call provide additional ways to go wide and increase the board presence, while key lands like Cavern of Souls and Inspiring Vantage help ensure a smooth mana curve for consistent aggression."

The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by denying their threats and disrupting their game plan. It includes a mix of efficient removal spells like Lightning Helix, along with counterspells like Get Lost and Memory Deluge for card advantage. The deck also has finishers like Jace, the Perfected Mind and The Wandering Emperor to close out the game once it has stabilized. The deck's key strategy is to control the game's tempo and win through incremental advantage."

The deck aims to quickly build a board presence and apply pressure on the opponent while maintaining control of the battlefield with removal and disruption spells. The mix of creatures with flying, deathtouch, and other abilities make it difficult for opponents to effectively block or remove threats, giving the deck an edge in combat and tempo."
