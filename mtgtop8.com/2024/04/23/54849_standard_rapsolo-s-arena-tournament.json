It prioritizes early aggression and consistent damage output to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize or gain control of the game. The inclusion of cards like Bloodthirsty Adversary and Monastery Swiftspear maximize damage potential, while spells like Lightning Strike and Play with Fire provide extra reach to finish off opponents. Mishra's Foundry and Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance add additional utility to support the aggressive game plan."
