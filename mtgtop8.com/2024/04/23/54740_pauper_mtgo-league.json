Cards like God-Pharaoh's Faithful and Sunscape Familiar help to stall the game while setting up the combo pieces. The use of counter spells like Remove Soul and Prohibit helps to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent through flickering effects and efficient card draw."
