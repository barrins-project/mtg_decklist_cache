By combining cards like Atraxa, Grand Unifier, Case of the Stashed Skeleton, and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm opponents with big threats. Additional support from cards like Duress, Fatal Push, and Thoughtseize helps control the board and disrupt opponents' strategies.
