            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and aggressive creatures that can deal damage quickly. By playing low-cost creatures with abilities that boost their power or allow them to deal extra damage, the deck aims to finish the game before the opponent has a chance to set up their own strategy. Additionally, cards like Case of the Crimson Pulse and Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance provide additional support and potential for dealing even more damage to the opponent. The deck relies on speed and aggression to secure a swift victory."
