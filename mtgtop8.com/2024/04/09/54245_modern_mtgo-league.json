The inclusion of Karn, the Great Creator provides additional utility and disruption, while March of Wretched Sorrow and Sheoldred's Edict help to maintain board control. The One Ring acts as a win condition, allowing the player to dominate the late game once they have gained enough control over the battlefield."

The deck uses cards like Bloodbraid Marauder and Grief to disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up for the combo. The deck also includes cards like Incubation / Incongruity and Muddle the Mixture for card selection and protection. The goal is to efficiently execute the Living End combo to win the game."
