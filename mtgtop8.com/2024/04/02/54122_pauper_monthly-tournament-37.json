Gnaw to the Bone helps gain life to stay in the game while creatures like Lotleth Giant and Troll of Khazad-dûm provide powerful finishers. Generous Ent can help with card draw and Graveyard recursion. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large number of creatures reanimated from the graveyard."
