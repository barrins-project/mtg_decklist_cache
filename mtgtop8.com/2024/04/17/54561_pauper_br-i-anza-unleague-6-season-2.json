The deck also includes efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Journey to Nowhere to control the board. Rally the Peasants and Battle Screech can provide a burst of damage to finish off the opponent, while Faithless Looting helps with card filtering. Prismatic Strands can protect your creatures from removal spells, while the mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to both red and white mana sources."
