The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and finish the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Cards like Bitter Triumph, Bloodletter of Aclazotz, and Preacher of the Schism offer strong aggressive options, while cards like Cut Down and Liliana of the Veil provide removal and disruption to clear the path for your creatures. The deck's strategy is to maintain pressure and force the opponent to react defensively."
