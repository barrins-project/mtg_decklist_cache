This mana is then used to power out combo pieces like Freed from the Real and Galvanic Alchemist to generate infinite loops or pump up creatures like Valakut Invoker for a finishing blow. The deck also utilizes creature tutors like Drift of Phantasms and Lead the Stampede to find the necessary combo pieces and maintain card advantage. Walls are crucial to the strategy, acting as both mana accelerators and defensive blockers."

By utilizing cards that provide additional damage, like All That Glitters and Galvanic Blast, along with efficient creatures like Kor Skyfisher and Glint Hawk, the deck aims to deal damage to the opponent as quickly as possible. The deck also includes cards like Makeshift Munitions and Barbed Batterfist to provide additional options for dealing damage and controlling the opponent's board. With a focus on aggression and speed, this deck looks to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
