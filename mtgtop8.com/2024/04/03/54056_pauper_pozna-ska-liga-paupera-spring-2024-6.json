The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by efficiently managing resources and outlasting them until the late game where it can unleash powerful finishers. The inclusion of graveyard hate cards like Bojuka Bog and Crypt Incursion helps to further disrupt opponent's strategies and gain an advantage. The deck's versatility and adaptability make it a formidable opponent in 1 vs 1 Pauper formats."
