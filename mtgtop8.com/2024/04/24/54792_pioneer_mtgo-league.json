The deck focuses on generating mana quickly with cards like Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves to cast powerful Elves like Shaman of the Pack and Elvish Warmaster. The deck also includes some disruption with Reclamation Sage and Werefox Bodyguard to deal with opposing threats. The mana base includes a mix of dual lands to ensure consistent access to the right colors of mana."

By playing aggressively and maximizing damage output each turn, the deck aims to quickly bring the opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize. Utilizing cards that deal damage directly to the opponent or their creatures, along with haste creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Ghitu Lavarunner, this deck is all about relentless assault and putting pressure on the opponent from the very beginning of the game."
