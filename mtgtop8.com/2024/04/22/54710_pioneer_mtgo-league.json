The combo pieces in the main deck, such as Greater Tanuki and Quintorius Kand, work together synergistically to create a powerful board presence and overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes versatile spells like Bedeck / Bedazzle and Release to the Wind to control the battlefield and disrupt the opponent's strategy."
