By utilizing cards that generate mana quickly, such as Simian Spirit Guide and Skirk Prospector, the deck can quickly deploy powerful Goblin creatures like Muxus, Goblin Grandee and Goblin Ringleader. Cards like Goblin Lackey and Goblin Matron help to search for key pieces, while Goblin Warchief and Krenko, Baron of Tin Street provide additional support and benefits for the Goblin tribe. The deck aims to flood the board with Goblins and quickly overrun the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
