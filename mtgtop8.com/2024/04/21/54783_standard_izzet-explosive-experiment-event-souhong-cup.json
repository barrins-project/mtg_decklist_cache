The deck focuses on using a combination of aggressive creatures like Preacher of the Schism and Raffine, Scheming Seer, along with removal spells like Go for the Throat to eliminate opposing threats. The inclusion of cards like Virtue of Loyalty and Cut Down helps to maintain board control, while Dennick, Pious Apprentice and Faerie Mastermind provide additional support and versatility. The land configuration allows for consistent mana production to support the deck's strategy."
