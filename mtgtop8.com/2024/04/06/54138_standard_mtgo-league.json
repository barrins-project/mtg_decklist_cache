The deck aims to dominate the late game with powerful tempo swings and card advantage, while also being able to close out games with a mix of burn spells and creature beatdowns. The inclusion of cards like Memory Deluge and Nissa, Resurgent Animist provide card advantage, while cards like Worldsoul's Rage and Vampires' Vengeance offer versatile removal options. The deck is designed to out-value opponents and grind out wins through attrition and resource management."
