The key strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent with early creatures like Bloodtithe Harvester and Voldaren Thrillseeker, while using removal spells like Bitter Triumph and Brotherhood's End to clear the way for your attackers. The deck also includes cards like Aclazotz, Deepest Betrayal and Agatha's Soul Cauldron to help maintain card advantage and close out the game. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy with a mix of Swamps, Mountains, and dual lands."
