It aims to slow down the opponent's game plan while drawing cards and setting up its own win conditions. The deck also includes cards that exile cards from the opponent's graveyard and manipulate the opponent's hand size. The mana base includes lands that provide different colors of mana and utility lands to disrupt the opponent's lands. The win conditions include cards that can generate card advantage and close out the game in a controlled manner."
