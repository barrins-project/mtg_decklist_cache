By sacrificing creatures to trigger effects like Village Rites and Deadly Dispute, the deck aims to create card advantage and maintain board presence. The inclusion of cards like Avenging Hunter and Bone Picker provides threats that can be difficult for opponents to deal with. This deck aims to grind out opponents by efficiently utilizing sacrifice synergies and disrupting their game plan."

Metallic Rebuke provides some disruption and protection, while cards like Thraben Inspector and Moon-Circuit Hacker help draw into more threats. Overall, this deck is built to be fast, aggressive, and efficient in Pauper 1 vs 1 matches."
