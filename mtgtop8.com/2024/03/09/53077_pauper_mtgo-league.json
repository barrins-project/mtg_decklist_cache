The Golgari Garden archetype focuses on creating a stable board presence with token generators like Khalni Garden and Thorn of the Black Rose, while also using removal spells like Cast Down and Defile to keep the opponent's threats at bay. The deck also includes card draw and life gain options to maintain resources and outlast the opponent in the long run."
