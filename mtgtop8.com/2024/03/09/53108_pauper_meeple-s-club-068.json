            "notes": "The main concept of this Golgari Garden Control deck is to maintain board control through creature removal and sacrifice effects, while generating card advantage with repeatable sacrifice outlets and card draw. This deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan with removal spells like Cast Down and Crypt Rats, while also leveraging self-sacrifice effects such as Deadly Dispute and Fanatical Offering to gain additional value. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent by efficiently managing resources and leveraging the synergy of sacrifice effects with graveyard interaction."
