Utilizing a mix of removal spells, powerful creatures with evasion, and cheap threats, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The combination of efficient removal, card advantage engines, and resilient creatures makes it difficult for opponents to keep up with the deck's relentless assault, leading to swift victories in the early stages of the game."
