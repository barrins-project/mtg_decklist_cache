The deck includes acceleration like Ancient Tomb and Lotus Petal to ramp into the combo pieces quickly. It also includes disruption like Force of Will to protect the combo. Once the Coveted Jewel is on the battlefield, it can generate massive amounts of mana and card advantage, allowing the player to cast powerful spells like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and The One Ring to win the game."
