By carefully sequencing spells and creatures, players can quickly build a board state that overwhelms their opponent. Cards like Wildgrowth Walker and Prosperous Innkeeper help generate additional resources, while Fauna Shaman and Chord of Calling provide toolbox options for finding key combo pieces. Return to the Ranks provides recursion for fallen creatures, ensuring that the deck can recover from removal. Ultimately, this deck aims to assemble its combo pieces to create an unbeatable board presence."
