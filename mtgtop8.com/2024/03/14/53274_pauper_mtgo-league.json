The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and stall the game until it can bring out powerful threats like Gurmag Angler and Cryptic Serpent to close out the game. The inclusion of Unexpected Fangs and Tolarian Terror provides additional ways to deal with threats, making it a well-rounded control deck with a strong late-game presence."
