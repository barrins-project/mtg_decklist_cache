By combining creatures like Slippery Bogle and Silhana Ledgewalker with powerful Auras like Ethereal Armor and Armadillo Cloak, the deck aims to create an overwhelming threat that is difficult for opponents to stop. The inclusion of cards like All That Glitters and Ancestral Mask further boosts the power of these creatures, allowing the deck to quickly close out games. Additional mana ramp and protection spells help to ensure consistency and resiliency."
