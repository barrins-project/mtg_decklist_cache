The deck is designed to overwhelm opponents with its aggressive strategies while also having some control elements to disrupt enemy plays. With a mix of card draw, token generation, and evasion, it aims to close out games quickly through efficient creature combat."

Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Lórien Revealed and Thorn of the Black Rose provides additional value and card advantage in the late game. The deck's win condition is through tempo advantage and gradual value accrual rather than fast aggression."

Mwonvuli Acid-Moss disrupts the opponent's mana base, and Skred can remove key threats.

It uses control elements like Mnemonic Wall and Moment's Peace to slow down the opponent while utilizing cards like Mulldrifter and Mystical Teachings for card advantage. It also includes some removal and counter spells like Rolling Thunder and Prohibit to deal with threats. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by efficiently using its resources and controlling the game until it can establish dominance with the Urzatron lands."
