The deck focuses on staying ahead in resources and using powerful finishers like Jace, the Perfected Mind and The Wandering Emperor to close out the game once control has been established. This deck aims to outlast and outsmart the opponent with careful resource management and strategic play."

It utilizes a mix of small, evasive creatures like Skrelv, Defector Mite and Jawbone Duelist, alongside powerful anthems like March of Swirling Mist and The Seedcore to pump up the team and push through damage. Additionally, cards like Fading Hope and Bring the Ending help to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Serum Snare provides removal options. The deck aims to close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
