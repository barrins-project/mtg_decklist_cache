            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly and aggressively overwhelm your opponent by playing low-cost creatures and spells to deal damage as quickly as possible. Cards like Goblin Bushwhacker and Burning-Tree Emissary help to flood the board with creatures, while burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Abrade are used to clear the way and deal direct damage to the opponent. The deck also utilizes mana acceleration cards like Lotus Petal and Simian Spirit Guide to quickly ramp up its resources and apply pressure early in the game."
