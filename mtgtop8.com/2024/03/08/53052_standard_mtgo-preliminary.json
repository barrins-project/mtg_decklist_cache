It aims to disrupt opponents' strategies while gaining card advantage with cards like Memory Deluge and Meticulous Archive. March of Otherworldly Light provides a win condition by allowing the player to exile their opponent's deck. The deck also utilizes land destruction with Field of Ruin and Restless Anchorage to disrupt the opponent's mana base. The deck's win condition is to outvalue the opponent with card advantage and eventually lock down the game for a victory."
