The deck aims to establish and maintain control of the game by limiting the opponent's options and gradually taking over the game with powerful late-game threats like Jace, the Perfected Mind and The Wandering Emperor. The mana base is designed to support the control elements of the deck while providing consistency in casting spells. Overall, the deck prioritizes control and manipulation of the game state to secure victory."
