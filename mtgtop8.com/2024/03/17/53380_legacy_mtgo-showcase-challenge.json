It utilizes cards like Entomb, Reanimate, and Animate Dead to achieve this goal. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Daze to protect the combo pieces and control the game. The creatures in the deck, such as Troll of Khazad-d√ªm and Archon of Cruelty, have strong abilities that can quickly swing the game in the player's favor once they hit the battlefield. Overall, this deck aims to outpace and overwhelm the opponent with its combo strategy."
