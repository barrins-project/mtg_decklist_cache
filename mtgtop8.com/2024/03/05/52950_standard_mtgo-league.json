By using cards like Deathcap Glade, Deep-Cavern Bat, and Preacher of the Schism, along with removal spells like Go for the Throat and Cut Down, the deck aims to establish board control while dealing damage efficiently. Cards like Liliana of the Veil and Glissa Sunslayer provide additional value and disruption to the opponent's strategy. The deck also includes lands that support the Golgari color combination, ensuring consistent mana production."
