By discarding cards from your hand to activate Tireless Tribe's ability, you can pump up its power and toughness, then use Inside Out to switch its power and toughness, potentially dealing lethal damage to your opponent in one hit. The deck includes various ways to manipulate your hand and draw cards to find the combo pieces, as well as protection spells to protect your combo from disruption."
