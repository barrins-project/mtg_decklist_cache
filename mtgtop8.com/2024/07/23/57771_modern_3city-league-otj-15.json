Once enough creatures are in the graveyard, the player can cast Living End to return them all to the battlefield, often overwhelming the opponent with a sudden influx of creatures. The deck also includes various control elements to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the strategy revolves around cycling through the deck to set up a powerful graveyard-based combo while managing resources and disrupting the opponent's strategy."
