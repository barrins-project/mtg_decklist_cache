The deck aims to maintain card advantage through card draw and selection spells, while using efficient removal like Skred and Lightning Bolt to handle threats. The addition of creatures like Murmuring Mystic and Tolarian Terror provides a win condition through attacking with tokens or flying creatures. The mana base includes Snow-Covered lands for additional synergy with cards like Skred and access to dual lands for color flexibility."
