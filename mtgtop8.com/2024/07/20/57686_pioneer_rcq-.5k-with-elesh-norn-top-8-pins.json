The deck includes cards that pump up creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Favored Hoplite, along with cards like Defiant Strike and Monstrous Rage to trigger their abilities and deal extra damage. The inclusion of Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion allows for additional mana ramp and flexibility in casting spells. Overall, the key strategy of this deck is to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react defensively."
