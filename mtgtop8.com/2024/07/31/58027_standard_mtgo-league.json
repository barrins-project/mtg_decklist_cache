By controlling the board and applying pressure, the deck can overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory."

With a mix of cheap creatures and efficient removal spells, the deck aims to control the board early on and finish the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Ral, Crackling Wit and disruptive spells like Phantom Interference adds versatility to the deck, allowing for different lines of attack depending on the matchup. The mana base is optimized for consistency and provides access to the necessary colors for the spells in the deck."
