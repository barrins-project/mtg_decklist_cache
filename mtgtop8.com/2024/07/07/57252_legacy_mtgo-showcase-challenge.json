The deck aims to lock the opponent out of the game by utilizing mana acceleration from cards like Chrome Mox and Simian Spirit Guide, and finish the game quickly with powerful creatures and burn spells like Fury and Shatterskull Smashing. The deck's strategy revolves around quick and efficient threats that can end the game before the opponent can stabilize."
