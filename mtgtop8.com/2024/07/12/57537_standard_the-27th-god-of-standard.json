The deck aims to attack quickly and efficiently, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. It also includes various graveyard synergies to take advantage of resources in the graveyard. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Sorin the Mirthless adds another layer of disruption and power to the deck. Overall, the deck focuses on a fast-paced, aggressive strategy with disruptive elements to control the game."

The mana base is centered around a mix of lands that provide different colors to ensure consistent casting of spells. Overall, the strategy of this deck is to establish dominance early and maintain control throughout the game."
