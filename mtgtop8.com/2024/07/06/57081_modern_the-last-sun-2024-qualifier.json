The key component of the deck is The One Ring, which can provide a massive advantage when used correctly. By controlling the opponent's threats and disrupting their game plan, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent, ultimately winning through a combination of card advantage and powerful threats like Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury. The mana base is designed to support the deck's control elements and allow for consistent casting of spells."
