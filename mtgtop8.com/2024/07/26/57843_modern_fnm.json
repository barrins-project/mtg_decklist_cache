It aims to protect its creatures and gain incremental advantage over time, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with a resilient and aggressive strategy. The key concept revolves around using Martyr of Sands to gain a large amount of life in a single turn, while also utilizing Ranger-Captain of Eos to tutor for key creatures. The deck also utilizes the synergy between creatures like Skyclave Apparition and Abiding Grace to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent."
