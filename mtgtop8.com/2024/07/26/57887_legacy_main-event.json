The deck seeks to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze, while also burning them out with Lightning Bolt and Unholy Heat. Mishra's Bauble and Brainstorm provide card selection, while Wasteland disrupts the opponent's mana base. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to seize the initiative and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of disruption and aggression."

            "notes": "The main strategy of the deck is to control the game by using cards like Stifle, Force of Will, and Swords to Plowshares to disrupt your opponent's plays. The deck also aims to stay ahead with card advantage through cards like Curie, Emergent Intelligence and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student. This control archetype also utilizes powerful threats like Phyrexian Dreadnought and Murktide Regent to close out the game quickly once the opponent's resources have been depleted. The inclusion of cards like Dress Down and Soul-Guide Lantern help to disrupt opposing strategies while maintaining card advantage for yourself."
