Wasteland and Ancient Tomb help to disrupt opponent's mana base, while Nulldrifter, Brazen Borrower, and Harbinger of the Seas deal damage and disrupt opponent's plays. Lotus Petal accelerates mana production, allowing for early plays of powerful threats like Hullbreacher and Karn, the Great Creator. Chalice of the Void and Force of Will provide additional disruption, while Day's Undoing refills the hand."
