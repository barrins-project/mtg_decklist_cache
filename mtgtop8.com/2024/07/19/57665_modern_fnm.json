By combining cards that provide food tokens, such as Gilded Goose and Seed of Hope, with powerful creatures like Feasting Troll King and Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar, the deck aims to put constant pressure on the opponent and secure victories through fast, efficient plays. The inclusion of cards like Urza's Saga and Insidious Roots further enhances the deck's ability to consistently generate threats and maintain a strong offense throughout the game."
