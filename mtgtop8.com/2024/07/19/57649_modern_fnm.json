            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly cycle through cards and manipulate the graveyard in order to cast Living End, a powerful sorcery that returns all creatures from the graveyard to the battlefield. By discarding cards like Street Wraith and Architects of Will, you can set up a big Living End play to overwhelm your opponent with a team of creatures. The deck also utilizes cards like Generous Gift and Grief to disrupt your opponent's strategy, while creatures like Waker of Waves and Curator of Mysteries provide additional support and card advantage."
