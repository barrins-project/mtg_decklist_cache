Malevolent Rumble provides damage to clear the way for attacks, while Writhing Chrysalis can create additional threats. Mwonvuli Acid-Moss and Thermokarst disrupt opponents' mana bases, while Wild Growth helps accelerate mana even further. Boarding Party and Generous Ent can provide additional utility and pressure. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and disrupt their mana base."
