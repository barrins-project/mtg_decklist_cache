By using a combination of creature-enhancing enchantments and protection spells, it aims to build a formidable board presence while also ensuring the creatures are difficult to remove. The key strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent through early aggression and efficient use of combat tricks, while also utilizing the lifelink ability of some creatures to gain an advantage in the race to reduce the opponent's life total to zero."
