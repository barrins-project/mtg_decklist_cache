The deck also utilizes cards like Murktide Regent and Questing Druid to generate card advantage and maintain tempo. The mana base is optimized for speed and consistency, with a mix of fetch lands and dual lands to ensure the deck can cast its spells on time. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and disrupt the opponent's game plan to secure victory."
