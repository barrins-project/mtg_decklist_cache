The deck includes creatures like God-Pharaoh's Faithful and Sunscape Familiar to gain life and reduce the cost of spells, as well as Archaeomancer and Murmuring Mystic for value. The Flicker effects like Ephemerate and Ghostly Flicker can be used to repeatedly abuse powerful enter-the-battlefield effects, while cards like Snap and Prohibit help control the board. Finally, Meeting of Minds and Lórien Revealed provide additional card draw to find the combo pieces."
