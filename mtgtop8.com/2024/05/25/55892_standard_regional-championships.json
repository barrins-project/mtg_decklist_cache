It aims to control the game by countering key spells, removing threats, and drawing extra cards with cards like Memory Deluge and Three Steps Ahead. The deck also includes win conditions like Jace, the Perfected Mind and The Wandering Emperor to close out the game once it has gained control. The mana base is designed to support the control strategy with a mix of lands that produce white and blue mana."
