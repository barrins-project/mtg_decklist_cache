The key strategy is to build a strong board presence with creatures like Skrelv, Defector Mite and Venerated Rotpriest, while using control spells like Fading Hope and Serum Snare to disrupt the opponent's plans. March of Swirling Mist can help to boost your creatures' power, while cards like Bring the Ending and Charge of the Mites provide additional removal and damage. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive game plan."

The deck also includes cards that can shut down opponent's strategies and prevent them from developing their board. Additionally, the deck includes powerful finishers like Jace, the Perfected Mind to close out the game once the opponent is in check."
