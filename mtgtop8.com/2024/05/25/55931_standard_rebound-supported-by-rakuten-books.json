With a mix of low-cost creatures and powerful spells like Gleeful Demolition, the deck aims to maintain board presence and close out games quickly. The lands in the deck are optimized for color consistency and to ensure smooth mana curve progression."

The deck utilizes a variety of spells to counter, remove, and manipulate the opponent's resources while drawing cards to maintain a full hand. With a mix of board wipes, counterspells, and card draw, the goal is to outlast the opponent and eventually win through incremental advantage. Utilizing lands like Field of Ruin and Restless Anchorage, the deck aims to control the battlefield and keep the opponent on the back foot until victory is achieved."
