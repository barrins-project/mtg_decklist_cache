The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan, maintain card advantage, and outvalue them in the long game. By leveraging a mix of control elements, card draw, and versatile spells, this deck aims to outmaneuver opponents and establish dominance on the battlefield while depleting their resources. The deck also includes a few win conditions to close out the game once the opponent is sufficiently weakened."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while gaining card advantage and eventually winning through either a large creature like Tishana's Tidebinder or by out-valuing the opponent with cards like Memory Deluge and Three Steps Ahead. The deck also includes some land destruction with Field of Ruin to further disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the key strategy is to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
