By chaining spells with Cascade abilities, cards like Shardless Agent and Violent Outburst allow for explosive turns that can overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Endurance to protect its game plan and disrupt the opponent's strategy. With a mix of tempo spells and efficient creatures, the goal is to maintain momentum and control the pace of the game until victory is achieved."
