With a mix of ramp, removal, and card draw, the goal is to outvalue your opponent and establish dominance on the battlefield. The creatures in the deck provide strong defensive options, while the spells help to disrupt your opponent's game plan. By efficiently using your resources and capitalizing on your opponent's misplays, you can slowly grind out a win through attrition and overwhelming board presence."

The mana base includes a mix of dual lands to ensure smooth mana production for both black and blue spells. Overall, the key strategy is to maintain board presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan through a combination of removal, counterspells, and card advantage."
