It aims to overwhelm the opponent early in the game by constantly pressuring them and forcing them to react to the relentless assault. The strategy relies on efficiently using mana to maximize damage output and seize control of the game before the opponent can stabilize. Additionally, the deck includes cards that provide additional reach or utility to ensure that it can maintain pressure and close out the game swiftly."
