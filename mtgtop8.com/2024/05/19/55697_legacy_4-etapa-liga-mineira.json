The deck also includes disruptive elements like Daze and Force of Will to protect the combo pieces and control the opponent's board state. Wasteland is included to disrupt the opponent's mana base, while Brazen Borrower can provide additional disruption and tempo advantage. Overall, the deck aims to assemble its combo pieces quickly and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."

It also utilizes various disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Lightning Bolt to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Green Sun's Zenith and Once Upon a Time help to find key creatures quickly, while cards like Endurance and Scavenging Ooze provide resilience against graveyard-based strategies. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistency and the inclusion of Grist, the Hunger Tide as a powerful win condition."
