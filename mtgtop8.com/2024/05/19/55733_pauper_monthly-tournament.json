            "notes": "The deck focuses on filling the graveyard with creatures quickly using cards like Satyr Wayfinder and Stinkweed Imp, then reanimating them using cards like Exhume and Dread Return. The goal is to bring out powerful creatures like Lotleth Giant and Troll of Khazad-dûm early in the game to overwhelm the opponent. Gnaw to the Bone helps to recover life while Acorn Harvest provides extra creature tokens. The deck also includes cards like Blanchwood Prowler and Rubblebelt Maverick for additional support. With a mix of reanimation and combo potential, this deck aims to win through overwhelming board presence."
