The deck also includes some lifegain and card draw to help sustain the control strategy. Additionally, it has some graveyard hate in the form of Bojuka Bog and Witch's Cottage to disrupt any graveyard-based strategies the opponent may have. Overall, this deck aims to outlast and outvalue the opponent through a combination of control and attrition."
