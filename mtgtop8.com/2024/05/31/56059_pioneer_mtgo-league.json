It also utilizes support cards like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic for additional ramp and Boseiju, Who Endures for protection. The strategy of the deck is to overwhelm opponents with big creatures and generate value through card draw and additional mana sources. Vivien Reid and Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner provide additional utility and card advantage in the mid to late game."
