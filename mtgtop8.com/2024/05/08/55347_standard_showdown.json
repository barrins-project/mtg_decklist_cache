It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building up its own resources and eventually win through incremental advantage. The deck uses a mix of control elements such as bounce spells, counterspells, and removal to establish board control and protect its win conditions. The key strategy is to efficiently manage resources and dictate the pace of the game, ultimately overpowering the opponent through strategic play and resource management."
