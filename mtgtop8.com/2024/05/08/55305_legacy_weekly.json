Cabal Therapy is used to disrupt the opponent's hand while Careful Study and Otherworldly Gaze help dig for combo pieces. The deck aims to win by either milling out the opponent or by utilizing the graveyard to create a strong board presence. The key strategy is to efficiently use the graveyard as a resource to gain advantage and overwhelm the opponent."
