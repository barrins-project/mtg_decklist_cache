            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to utilize the Dredge mechanic to fill the graveyard with key cards and quickly reanimate or bring them back to the battlefield. By milling cards from the library, the deck aims to trigger cards like Narcomoeba, Prized Amalgam, and Creeping Chill to create a powerful board presence and drain the opponent's life total. Additionally, the deck includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Chalice of the Void to protect its game plan and hinder the opponent's strategies. Finally, cards like Hollow One and Silversmote Ghoul provide additional explosiveness and flexibility to the combo-focused gameplay."
