The deck aims to cheat out big creatures like Griselbrand and Sphinx of the Steel Wind to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats. The deck also includes counterspells like Force of Will and Daze to protect its combo pieces, as well as card selection tools like Brainstorm and Ponder to find the necessary combo pieces. The deck is designed to win the game quickly through explosive plays."

Stoneforge Mystic is used to tutor for powerful equipment pieces like Batterskull, Sword of Feast and Famine, and Umezawa's Jitte to further control the board and gain an advantage. Knight of the Reliquary and Noble Hierarch provide additional value and mana ramp to support the control strategy."

Price of Progress is another key card that punishes opponents for playing nonbasic lands, further increasing the deck's ability to deal damage quickly and efficiently."

This allows the player to swarm the board with creatures, buff them with Joraga Warcaller, and potentially draw more cards with Regal Force. The deck also includes tools like Green Sun's Zenith and Living Wish to search for specific Elves or utility cards to further advance the combo strategy."
