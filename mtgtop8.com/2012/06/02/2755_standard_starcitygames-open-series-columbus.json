By using cards like Dissipate, Mana Leak, and Negate to disrupt the opponent's plays, along with sweepers like Day of Judgment and Terminus, the deck aims to survive long enough to establish a dominant board presence. Sun Titan and Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite are key win conditions that can be brought back from the graveyard with Unburial Rites, while Lingering Souls provides a steady stream of blockers and attackers. Overall, the deck aims to out-value opponents and grind them down to secure a victory."
