The deck also utilizes combo pieces like Sterling Grove and Replenish to search for and recur powerful enchantments like Solitary Confinement and Sigil of the Empty Throne for additional game-winning options. There is also some disruption included with cards like Oblivion Ring and Humility to manage the opponent's threats."
