By utilizing cards like Preeminent Captain and Enlistment Officer to cheat out bigger creatures like Captain of the Watch, the deck aims to establish a strong battlefield presence early on. The inclusion of mana acceleration cards like Chrome Mox and Ancient Tomb helps to speed up the casting of creatures, while disruptive cards like Chalice of the Void and Suppression Field hinder the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to close out games quickly through a swarm of weenie white creatures."
