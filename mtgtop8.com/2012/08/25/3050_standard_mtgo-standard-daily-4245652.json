            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly and aggressively overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of small creatures, known as \"weenies\". Cards like Thatcher Revolt and Gather the Townsfolk help populate the board with multiple creatures, while cards like Signal Pest and Kruin Striker provide additional damage and evasion. Mikaeus, the Lunarch can pump up the team, and Hero of Oxid Ridge can grant haste to help push through damage. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain a relentless assault until victory."

By using cards like Black Sun's Zenith, Curse of Death's Hold, and Mutilate, the deck can keep the opponent's board in check. The artifacts like Batterskull, Wurmcoil Engine, and Trading Post provide additional threats and resilience. The deck also includes ways to recur artifacts with Buried Ruin and Phyrexia's Core, ensuring a steady stream of resources. Overall, the key concept is to outvalue the opponent through efficient control and resource management."
