            "notes": "The main theme of this deck is to consistently apply early pressure on the opponent using cheap and efficient creatures like Delver of Secrets and Geist of Saint Traft, while controlling the board with counterspells like Mana Leak and disruption spells like Vapor Snag and Gut Shot. The deck also utilizes card draw and filtering with cards like Thought Scour and Ponder to maintain a steady stream of threats. The inclusion of equipment like Runechanter's Pike enhances the power of the creatures, creating a powerful aggro strategy with a touch of control elements."
