This allows the player to cast powerful threats such as Karn Liberated, Wurmcoil Engine, and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn ahead of schedule. In addition, the deck includes various control elements such as Relic of Progenitus and Oblivion Stone to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also using card draw and filtering effects like Sylvan Scrying and Prophetic Prism to ensure consistency in finding key pieces of the combo."
