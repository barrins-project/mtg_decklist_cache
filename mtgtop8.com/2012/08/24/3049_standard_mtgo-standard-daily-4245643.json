By using cards like Snapcaster Mage and Restoration Angel to maximize value from spells like Vapor Snag and Mana Leak, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain pressure on the board. Key cards like Blade Splicer and Phantasmal Image provide a strong creature base, while cards like Gideon Jura and Consecrated Sphinx offer additional threats and card advantage. The deck utilizes a combination of aggression and control to secure victory."
