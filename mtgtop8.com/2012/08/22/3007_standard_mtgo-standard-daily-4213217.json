By efficiently using counterspells and removal like Vapor Snag and Gut Shot, the deck aims to protect its threats and maintain tempo advantage. Key cards like Geist of Saint Traft and Snapcaster Mage provide strong win conditions, while utility lands like Moorland Haunt provide additional value. Using aggressive creatures and disruptive spells, the deck aims to quickly close out games before opponents can stabilize."
