            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by using Birthing Pod to continuously search for and play powerful creatures. The deck includes a mix of mana dorks, value creatures, and powerful finishers to outvalue and outlast the opponent. Using cards like Thragtusk and Restoration Angel for value, Huntmaster of the Fells for incremental advantage, and Inferno Titan for a big finish, the deck aims to control the board while eventually overwhelming the opponent with a steady stream of threats."
