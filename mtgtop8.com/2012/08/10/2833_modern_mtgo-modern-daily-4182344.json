It also includes control elements such as Karn Liberated, Oblivion Stone, and Pyroclasm to deal with threats from the opponent. The deck also features card draw and mana fixing with Ancient Stirrings, Chromatic Sphere, and Chromatic Star, as well as deck searching with Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying. Relic of Progenitus provides graveyard hate to disrupt opponent strategies."
