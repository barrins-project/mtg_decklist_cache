Additionally, the deck includes removal spells like Go for the Throat and Tragic Slip to control the board, allowing the zombies to continue their assault. The inclusion of cards like Phyrexian Obliterator adds additional threats to the battlefield, making it difficult for the opponent to handle the constant onslaught of creatures."
