The inclusion of Runechanter's Pike allows for potent late-game threats, while cards like Gitaxian Probe and Thought Scour help maintain card advantage. The balanced mix of creatures, spells, and equipment enables the deck to maintain pressure and control throughout the game."

The deck also includes control elements like Bonfire of the Damned and Karn Liberated to deal with opponent's threats. The mana base is focused on utilizing Kessig Wolf Run and other lands to give creatures additional power, making them harder to deal with. Overall, the deck aims to control the board and overwhelm the opponent with big threats."
