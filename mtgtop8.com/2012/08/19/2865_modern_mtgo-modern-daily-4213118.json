By utilizing the synergy between artifact creatures and equipment, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently. With the ability to quickly build a threatening board presence and deal direct damage with cards like Galvanic Blast, this deck focuses on aggressive plays and capitalizing on the powerful interactions between artifacts and creatures."
