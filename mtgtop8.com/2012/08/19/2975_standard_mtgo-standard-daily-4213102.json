The deck also includes disruptive spells like Mana Leak and Vapor Snag to control the opponent's board. With the help of cards like Snapcaster Mage and Restoration Angel, the deck can recur spells and protect its creatures. The deck's win condition revolves around equipping Runechanter's Pike to a creature and dealing large amounts of damage quickly. Overall, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain that pressure throughout the game."
