The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's hand with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, while also controlling the board with removal spells like Path to Exile and Tidehollow Sculler. Additionally, cards like Lingering Souls and Spectral Procession provide a steady stream of token creatures to keep up the pressure. The deck aims to quickly build a wide board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
