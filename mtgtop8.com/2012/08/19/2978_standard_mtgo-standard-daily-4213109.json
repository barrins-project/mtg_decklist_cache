The deck also includes graveyard hate with Nihil Spellbomb and ways to recur key artifacts with Buried Ruin and Trading Post. The win condition comes from powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Karn Liberated."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly deploying threats and disrupting opponents' plans while maintaining card advantage through card draw and tempo plays. The key strategy is to apply pressure early with efficient creatures like Delver of Secrets and Snapcaster Mage, while using counterspells like Mana Leak and disruption spells like Gitaxian Probe to control the game. The deck also includes Lingering Souls for additional value and Talrand, Sky Summoner for generating flying tokens. The inclusion of Sword of War and Peace provides a strong finisher for the deck's aggressive game plan."
