The deck also includes control elements such as Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Bonfire of the Damned to disrupt the opponent's plans. The goal of the deck is to continually upgrade its creatures and outvalue the opponent by using Birthing Pod."

Removal spells like Doom Blade and Tragic Slip help keep the opponent's creatures in check, while equipment like Lashwrithe and Mortarpod provide additional reach and utility. Sign in Blood and Geth's Verdict offer card draw and disruption, making this deck a relentless force to be reckoned with."
