By utilizing cards like Blight Mamba, Glistener Elf, and Inkmoth Nexus, you can quickly rack up poison counters on your opponent. Cards like Mutagenic Growth, Rancor, and Titanic Growth help to boost your creatures' power and toughness, while cards like Mental Misstep and Ranger's Guile protect them from removal spells. Wild Defiance further enhances your pump spells, making it difficult for your opponent to stop your infectious assault."
