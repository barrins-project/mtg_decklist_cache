The key strategy is to stall the game until the late game where powerful threats like Sun Titan and Wurmcoil Engine can take over. The deck also has the ability to disrupt the opponent's game plan through cards like Curse of Death's Hold and Nihil Spellbomb. By combining disruption, card advantage, and powerful late-game threats, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent."

It utilizes a mixture of creatures with disruptive abilities, like Delver of Secrets and Restoration Angel, powerful removal like Bonfire of the Damned, and card draw to maintain card advantage. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure smooth mana fixing for the three colors of the deck. Overall, the strategy is to apply pressure early and efficiently while disrupting the opponent's game plan with counterspells and removal."
