The deck utilizes board wipes like Day of Judgment and Terminus to clear the field, while also having control elements like Dissipate and Oblivion Ring to deal with key threats. It aims to stall the game until it can cast powerful angels with Entreat the Angels or generate card advantage with Tamiyo, the Moon Sage and Visions of Beyond."

Tezzeret serves as a key card in the strategy, providing card filtering and a win condition with his ultimate ability. The deck also employs various artifact-based removal spells like Black Sun's Zenith and Whipflare to control the board. By utilizing artifacts like Mycosynth Wellspring and Pristine Talisman for ramp and card draw, the deck aims to outvalue opponents and grind out wins through attrition. Trading Post and Solemn Simulacrum offer additional utility and value in the mid to late game."
