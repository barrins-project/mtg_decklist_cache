The key strategy is to combine the synergies between artifact creatures, equipment, and cards like Arcbound Ravager, Steel Overseer, and Cranial Plating to create a fast and aggressive game plan. The deck aims to win through aggressive combat, backed up by efficient removal and card draw to maintain tempo and pressure. Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas also provides additional card advantage and utility for the deck."
