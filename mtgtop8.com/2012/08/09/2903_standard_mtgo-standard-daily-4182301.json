The deck includes strong creatures like Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite, Inferno Titan, and Griselbrand to take advantage of this strategy. The mana base is designed to support this combo playstyle with a mix of dual lands and mana dorks to ramp up to the higher mana cost creatures. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures brought back from the graveyard."
