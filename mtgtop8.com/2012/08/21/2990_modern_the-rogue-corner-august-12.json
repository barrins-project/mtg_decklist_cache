The deck includes a mix of counterspells like Cryptic Command and Remand, as well as utility cards like Guile and Snapcaster Mage. By controlling the board and limiting the opponent's resources, this deck aims to outlast the opponent and ultimately secure a victory through careful decision-making and resource management."
