The deck also includes cards like Shrine of Burning Rage and Grim Lavamancer for additional damage output. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and consistent damage to secure a win before they can stabilize."

The deck aims to establish an early board presence with creatures like Birds of Paradise, Llanowar Elves, and Strangleroot Geist, while also providing disruption with cards like Dismember and Bonfire of the Damned. The inclusion of powerful threats like Huntmaster of the Fells and Thragtusk ensures that the pressure stays on, while cards like Sword of War and Peace and Sword of Feast and Famine provide additional reach and protection."
