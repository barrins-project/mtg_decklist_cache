The deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence with efficient creatures like Delver of Secrets and Geist of Saint Traft, while also utilizing cards like Vapor Snag and Restoration Angel to maintain tempo and protect key threats. The inclusion of card draw and mana fixing spells like Ponder and Gitaxian Probe helps to ensure consistency and keep the pressure on the opponent."
