The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive attack, utilizing cards like Galvanic Blast and Shrapnel Blast for additional reach and removal. The deck also includes mana acceleration in the form of Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to ensure it can quickly get its threats on the board. The use of efficient artifacts and synergy between cards makes it a potent threat in the Modern format."
