The deck includes several cards for card draw and selection, as well as protection spells like Dispel and Spellskite to ensure the combo goes off smoothly. The mana base is designed to support the combo pieces and allow for flexibility in casting spells. The goal is to quickly assemble the combo and win before the opponent can disrupt it."
