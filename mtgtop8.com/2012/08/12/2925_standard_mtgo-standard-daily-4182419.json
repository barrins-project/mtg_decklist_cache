The deck also focuses on controlling the board with disruption spells like Mana Leak and Vapor Snag, while also having card advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Augur of Bolas. The deck aims to close out games quickly by consistently attacking and presenting threats that are difficult for the opponent to deal with efficiently."
