By combining evasion abilities on creatures like Geist of Saint Traft and Delver of Secrets with support from cards like Vapor Snag and Runechanter's Pike, the deck aims to maintain pressure and tempo advantage throughout the game. The inclusion of counterspells like Mana Leak and versatile creatures like Snapcaster Mage provide versatility and disruption against opponent's strategies, while Restoration Angel serves as a value creature with potential for combat tricks."
