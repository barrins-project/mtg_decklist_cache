By utilizing cards like Martyr of Sands and Serra Ascendant to gain life, the deck can quickly grow Ajani's Pridemate and other creatures while maintaining a high life total. The inclusion of Squadron Hawk and Ranger of Eos provides card advantage and helps maintain a strong board presence. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and resilient army of creatures supported by lifegain synergies."
