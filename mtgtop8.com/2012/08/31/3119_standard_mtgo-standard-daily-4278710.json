It focuses on fast, aggressive plays using spells like Vapor Snag and Gut Shot to control the board early on. The deck also utilizes card draw and graveyard interaction with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Thought Scour. By building a board presence with powerful creatures like Geist of Saint Traft and utilizing removal and counterspells, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win the game quickly."
