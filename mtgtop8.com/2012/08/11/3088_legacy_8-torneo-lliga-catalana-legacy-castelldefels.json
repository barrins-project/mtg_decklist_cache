By efficiently using cards like Delver of Secrets, Tarmogoyf, and Nimble Mongoose alongside disruptive spells like Force of Will and Daze, the deck can quickly close out games while countering threats and disrupting opponents' plays. The deck's mana base allows for consistent casting of its spells and the use of Wasteland to disrupt opponents' mana bases. Overall, the deck focuses on tempo and aggression to secure victories in Legacy 1 vs 1 matchups."

Using cards like Aether Vial and Goblin Lackey to bring out creatures for free, along with powerful Goblin lords like Goblin Warchief and Goblin Chieftain to pump up your team, allows for fast and explosive plays. This deck also includes disruptive elements like Stingscourger and Gempalm Incinerator to control the opponent's board while pushing through damage. The inclusion of cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port helps to disrupt the opponent's mana base and slow them down, giving the goblins an advantage in the race."

The deck also uses Green Sun's Zenith to tutor for specific creatures like Gaddock Teeg or Scavenging Ooze, providing flexibility in different matchups. Additionally, the deck utilizes mana acceleration with Noble Hierarch and mana denial with cards like Wasteland to control the pace of the game."

The deck also includes disruptive elements like Thoughtseize and Force of Will to protect the combo. With a focus on powerful creatures like Jin-Gitaxias and Griselbrand, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence and tempo advantage. The deck is built around the synergy between reanimation spells and high-impact creatures to quickly close out games."

The deck also aims to control the board with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Wasteland, all while ensuring card advantage and efficient deck filtering with Ponder, Brainstorm, and fetch lands. The key strategy is to apply early pressure, disrupt the opponent's plays, and maintain card advantage to win the game quickly and efficiently."
