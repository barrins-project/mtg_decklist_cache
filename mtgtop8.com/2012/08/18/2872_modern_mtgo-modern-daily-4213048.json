The deck aims to deal damage early and often, using cards like Lightning Bolt, Searing Blaze, and Goblin Guide to chip away at the opponent's life total. Tarmogoyf serves as a powerful threat that can quickly grow in size, while cards like Rancor and Strangleroot Geist provide additional aggression. Grim Lavamancer helps to control the board and maintain pressure, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. This deck is designed to win the game quickly through aggressive tactics."
