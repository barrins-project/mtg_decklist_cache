The inclusion of Faerie tribal support cards like Scion of Oona and Mistbind Clique further enhances the deck's ability to protect its creatures and push for victory. Additionally, the deck utilizes utility lands like Mutavault and Tectonic Edge to maintain board presence and disrupt opponent's mana base."

Lingering Souls provides additional threats and evasion, while Snapcaster Mage adds versatility by flashing back spells. The deck also includes powerful equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine and Sword of Fire and Ice to close out games quickly. The mana base allows for consistent casting of spells and activating creature lands like Creeping Tar Pit for additional pressure."
