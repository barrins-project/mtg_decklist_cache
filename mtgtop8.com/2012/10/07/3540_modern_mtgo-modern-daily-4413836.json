By utilizing cards like Lightning Helix, Lightning Bolt, and Dismember for removal, as well as Thalia, Guardian of Thraben for disruption, the deck aims to maintain a strong board presence while controlling the opponent's plays. The inclusion of Blood Moon can also disrupt opposing mana bases, giving the deck an advantage. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and efficient removal spells."
