The inclusion of creatures like Hellspark Elemental and Grim Lavamancer adds additional pressure to the opponent, while Searing Blaze and Shard Volley provide both removal and additional damage. The deck is designed to be fast and relentless in its efforts to win the game."

It also includes versatile removal spells like Path to Exile and counterspells like Remand to control the board. Tribal Flames is included as a powerful finisher that can deal significant damage to the opponent. The deck emphasizes tempo and efficiency, aiming to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the multiple colors needed for the deck's spells."
