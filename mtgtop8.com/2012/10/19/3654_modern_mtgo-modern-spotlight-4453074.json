This allows for the efficient casting of creatures like Vengevine and Lotleth Troll while Thalia, Guardian of Thraben slows down the opponent's spells. The deck uses lands that enable both color fixing and sacrificing for additional graveyard value. Overall, the deck focuses on exploiting the graveyard and disrupting the opponent to achieve victory."
