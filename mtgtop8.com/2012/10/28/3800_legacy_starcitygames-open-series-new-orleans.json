Key cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Force of Will, and Terminus help control the board while cards like Sensei's Divining Top and Counterbalance provide card advantage and disruption. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the control strategy with utility lands like Karakas and Wasteland. The deck excels at outmaneuvering opponents and grinding out incremental advantages over the course of the game."
