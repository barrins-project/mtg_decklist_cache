The key is to quickly develop a board presence with cheap artifact creatures like Vault Skirge, Signal Pest, and Ornithopter, and then boost their power with Cranial Plating and other equipment. Additionally, cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum help accelerate the mana curve. The deck also has removal options like Galvanic Blast and Shrapnel Blast to deal with threats. The overall goal is to win the game quickly by attacking relentlessly with a powerful board state."
