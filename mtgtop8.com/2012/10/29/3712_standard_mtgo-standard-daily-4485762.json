Lingering Souls provides additional threats and Thragtusk offers stabilization. Additional removal and utility cards like Dreadbore are included for flexibility. Olivia Voldaren and Craterhoof Behemoth provide alternate win conditions. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and combo potential."
