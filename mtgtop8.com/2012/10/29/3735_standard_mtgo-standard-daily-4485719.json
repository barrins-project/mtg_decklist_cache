It aims to overwhelm the opponent with quick, powerful attacks boosted by cards like Rancor and Selesnya Charm. The inclusion of Thragtusk and Restoration Angel provides some resilience and value in longer games. The mana base supports a smooth curve and allows for the activation of Gavony Township to further enhance the aggression of the deck."
