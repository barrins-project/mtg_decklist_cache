The inclusion of control elements like Mana Leak and Path to Exile helps to maintain board control while Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage provide card advantage and consistency. The mana base is built to support the three colors of the deck, allowing for flexibility in casting spells and maximizing efficiency."
