By gaining life and utilizing anthem effects like Honor of the Pure, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a horde of powerful creatures, such as Ajani's Pridemate and Squadron Hawk. Additionally, the deck includes disruption in the form of Aven Mindcensor and removal spells like Path to Exile to control the game and secure victory through aggression and life gain."
