By efficiently ramping into big threats like Armada Wurm and Thragtusk, the deck aims to overpower the opponent and control the board with cards like Restoration Angel and Angel of Serenity. The inclusion of cards like Farseek and Arbor Elf help ensure consistent mana production, while cards like Centaur Healer provide additional lifegain to stabilize against aggressive strategies. Overall, the deck is designed to aggressively push the opponent while maintaining a strong board presence."
