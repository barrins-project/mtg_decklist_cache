By leveraging cards such as Champion of the Parish, Doomed Traveler, Elite Inquisitor, and Geist of Saint Traft, it aims to establish a threatening board state early in the game. With support from cards like Ajani, Caller of the Pride, Sublime Archangel, and Silverblade Paladin, the deck can give its creatures additional power and evasion to deal a significant amount of damage in a short amount of time."
