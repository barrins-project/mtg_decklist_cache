It aims to control the game by generating value from creatures entering and leaving the battlefield, while also taking advantage of creatures with powerful abilities. The deck includes a mix of removal and creatures with strong enter-the-battlefield effects to outvalue opponents and maintain board control. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and provide access to necessary lands for consistency in casting spells."
