The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with an army of creatures while steadily increasing your life total, leading to a quick victory through combat damage."

This mana is used to cast powerful threats like Karn Liberated, Wurmcoil Engine, and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, while also controlling the game with cards like Pyroclasm and Oblivion Stone. The deck is designed to efficiently find its key pieces with cards like Sylvan Scrying, Expedition Map, and Ancient Stirrings, creating a strong and consistent game plan."
