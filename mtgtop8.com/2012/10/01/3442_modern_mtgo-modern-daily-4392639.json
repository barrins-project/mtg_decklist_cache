The inclusion of Isochron Scepter adds versatility by allowing you to imprint powerful instants like Lightning Helix onto it for repeated use. The mana base is optimized for consistency in casting spells and activating the Scepter. The deck aims to apply constant pressure and control the game tempo to secure a fast victory."
