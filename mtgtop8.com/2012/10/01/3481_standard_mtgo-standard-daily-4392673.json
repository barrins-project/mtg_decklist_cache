It includes cards like Gravecrawler and Geralf's Messenger that can come back from the graveyard multiple times, along with cards like Blood Artist for extra value when creatures die. The mana base includes lands to help ensure the deck can consistently play its threats, while also allowing for some protection from countermagic with Cavern of Souls."
