It also aims to ramp up mana quickly with Farseek and use powerful creatures like Thragtusk, Huntmaster of the Fells, and Olivia Voldaren to dominate the battlefield. The deck also includes Rakdos Keyrune and Kessig Wolf Run to provide additional versatility and finish off opponents. Overall, the strategy revolves around efficient removal, solid creatures, and mana acceleration to maintain control of the game."
