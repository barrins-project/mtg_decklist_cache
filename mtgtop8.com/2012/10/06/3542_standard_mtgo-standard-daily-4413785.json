The deck is built around synergy between cards like Phantasmal Image, Skirsdag High Priest, and Bloodthrone Vampire to create a strong board presence and take advantage of creature sacrifices. Support cards like Geth's Verdict and Tragic Slip help remove opposing threats, while cards like Gravecrawler and Geralf's Messenger provide additional combat damage. The inclusion of Blood Artist also allows for additional damage and life gain. The land base is focused on providing reliable access to black mana for casting the deck's numerous creatures and spells.<br/>\n"

Wild Defiance serves as a powerful tool to protect the creatures and amplify the damage output. Inkmoth Nexus provides additional ways to deal poison counters while also serving as a mana source."
