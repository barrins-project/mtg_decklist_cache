The deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total and finish them off with powerful creatures like Falkenrath Aristocrat and Zealous Conscripts. With a strong focus on aggression and burn spells, this deck looks to overwhelm opponents before they can stabilize their board."

The deck also includes cards like Blood Artist and Bloodthrone Vampire to take advantage of sacrificing creatures for added effects. The deck also includes removal spells like Pillar of Flame and Tragic Slip to deal with threats from the opponent, while also using cards like Sign in Blood for card draw and Bonfire of the Damned for board control. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly with a horde of undead creatures."
