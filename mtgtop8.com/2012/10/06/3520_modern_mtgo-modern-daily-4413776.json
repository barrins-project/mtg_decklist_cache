The key strategy is to play Martyr of Sands to gain a large amount of life, enabling powerful creatures like Serra Ascendant and Ajani's Pridemate to become huge threats. By combining efficient creatures and spells that boost their power, this deck aims to win the game through aggressive combat damage while also gaining and maintaining a high life total."
