The deck also includes protection spells like Apostle's Blessing and Vines of Vastwood to ensure the infect creatures can get through and deal damage. The deck aims to be fast and aggressive, utilizing efficient mana ramp with Noble Hierarch and land fetching with cards like Verdant Catacombs and Misty Rainforest to get the necessary resources quickly."
