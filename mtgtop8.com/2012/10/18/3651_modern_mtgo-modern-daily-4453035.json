This allows the player to cast powerful game-winning threats such as Wurmcoil Engine, Emrakul, and Karn Liberated. The deck also includes tools for control like Pyroclasm and Relic of Progenitus, along with card draw and filtering through cards like Chromatic Star and Ancient Stirrings. The deck's goal is to outvalue the opponent with massive threats and efficient removal while controlling the game."
