By using mana ramp cards like Avacyn's Pilgrim and Arbor Elf, players can drop big threats like Thragtusk and Loxodon Smiter early in the game. Cards like Rancor and Silverblade Paladin can further increase the pressure on the opponent, while cards like Restoration Angel can provide utility and evasion. The deck also features some disruptive elements like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to slow down the opponent's game plan. The goal is to establish a dominant position on the battlefield and close out the game swiftly."

Utilizing tokens from cards like Lingering Souls and Gather the Townsfolk, combined with powerful creatures like Thragtusk and Loxodon Smiter, the deck aims to build a wide board presence and finish off the opponent quickly. Cards like Sorin, Lord of Innistrad and Collective Blessing provide additional support to the swarm of tokens, making it a fast and aggressive strategy."
