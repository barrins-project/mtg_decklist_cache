Snapcaster Mage provides additional flexibility by allowing the player to reuse key spells from the graveyard. The win condition is to eventually overwhelm the opponent with angels from Entreat the Angels or card advantage from Sphinx's Revelation."

The deck aims to maintain board control using cards like Supreme Verdict, Terminus, and Detention Sphere, while generating card advantage with cards like Think Twice and Jace, Architect of Thought. Tamiyo, the Moon Sage and Entreat the Angels provide additional ways to control the game and win late. The deck's mana base is designed to consistently hit the necessary mana to cast its spells while keeping the colors balanced for the deck's requirements."
