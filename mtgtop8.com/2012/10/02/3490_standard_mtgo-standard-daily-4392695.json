Cards such as Delver of Secrets, Geist of Saint Traft, and Restoration Angel provide powerful threats that can quickly turn the tide of the game. The inclusion of cards like Vapor Snag and Thought Scour allows for disruption and card draw, while cards like Runechanter's Pike and Blade Splicer provide additional support and value. The mana base is optimized for consistent casting of spells while also providing options for color fixing."

It includes spells that boost the power of these creatures and protect them from removal, as well as lands that enhance their infect damage potential. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient attacks and ultimately win the game by dealing enough poison counters before the opponent can stabilize."

The addition of counterspells like Mana Leak and tempo plays with Restoration Angel make this deck a versatile and powerful aggressive option in Standard 1 vs 1 format."
