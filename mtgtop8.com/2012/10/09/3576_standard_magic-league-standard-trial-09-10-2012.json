By using cards like Detention Sphere, Terminus, and Supreme Verdict to deal with threats, along with counterspells like Syncopate and Azorius Charm, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and eventually win the game with powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels. Tamiyo, the Moon Sage and Jace, Architect of Thought provide additional card advantage and control options, while Snapcaster Mage adds versatility by allowing you to reuse spells from your graveyard."

Restoration Angel and Angel of Serenity provide added value by either blinking creatures or removing threats from the opponent's side of the board. Gavony Township and Vault of the Archangel offer additional utility and buffs to your creatures, while Chromatic Lantern ensures smooth mana fixing. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of powerful creatures and control the board."
