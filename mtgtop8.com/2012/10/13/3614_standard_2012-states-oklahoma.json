The deck aims to answer threats with cards like Dreadbore, Mizzium Mortars, and Pillar of Flame while also generating card advantage through cards like Forbidden Alchemy and Desolate Lighthouse. Additionally, powerful planeswalkers like Tamiyo, the Moon Sage and Jace, Architect of Thought provide additional value and card advantage.

            "notes": "The deck focuses on building a wide board presence with tokens and then boosting them with anthem effects like Intangible Virtue and Collective Blessing. It also utilizes cards like Trostani, Selesnya's Voice and Thragtusk to gain life and create more tokens. The deck includes planeswalkers like Sorin, Lord of Innistrad and Garruk, Primal Hunter for additional token generation and card advantage. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of powerful token creatures while gaining incremental advantages through lifegain and card draw."
