By utilizing cards like Soul Warden, Soul's Attendant, and Martyr of Sands, the player can quickly gain life and power up cards like Ajani's Pridemate and Serra Ascendant. Additionally, cards like Spectral Procession and Squadron Hawk provide both creatures and additional support. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of lifegain and creature aggression, ultimately creating a powerful board presence."
