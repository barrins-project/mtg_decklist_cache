By controlling the board with cheap zombies like Diregraf Ghoul and Gravecrawler, while also dealing direct damage with cards like Searing Spear and Brimstone Volley, you can pressure your opponent and finish them off with powerful creatures like Falkenrath Aristocrat. The mana base is optimized for quick and consistent plays, while including cards like Blood Artist to gain incremental advantage from sacrificing creatures. Ultimately, this deck aims to win the game quickly and decisively."

By using cards like Jace, Architect of Thought and Detention Sphere to handle threats, along with sweepers like Supreme Verdict and Terminus to reset the board, the deck aims to control the pace of the game. With access to efficient ramp spells like Farseek and Sphinx's Revelation for card draw and life gain, the deck can generate a strong advantage in the late game. Finally, threats like Armada Wurm and Thragtusk provide a solid win condition."
