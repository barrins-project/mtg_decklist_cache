The deck aims to eventually close out the game by either casting powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels and Angel of Serenity, or gaining a significant life advantage with Sphinx's Revelation. The combination of control elements and strong finishers make this deck a formidable force in the Standard 1 vs 1 format."

The deck aims to delay the game until it can cast powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels and Tamiyo, the Moon Sage. By controlling the board and manipulating resources with cards like Jace, Architect of Thought and Sands of Delirium, the deck can outlast opponents and secure victory through incremental advantage and superior late-game threats."
