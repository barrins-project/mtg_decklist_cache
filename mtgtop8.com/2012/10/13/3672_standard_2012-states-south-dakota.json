Using powerful planeswalkers like Tamiyo and Jace, along with board wipes like Terminus and Supreme Verdict, the deck aims to stall the game until it can cast powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Detention Sphere and Azorius Charm allows for flexibility in dealing with different threats. Overall, this deck focuses on staying in control of the game and outlasting the opponent."
