The key idea is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and powerful buff spells, while also having the flexibility to deal with threats through removal and protective creatures. The deck focuses on creating a fast and resilient offense that can quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The Selesnya color combination allows for a mix of efficient creatures and versatile spells to create a consistent and potent aggro strategy."
