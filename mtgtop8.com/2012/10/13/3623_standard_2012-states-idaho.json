By quickly building a board presence and applying pressure, this Aggro - Weenie White deck aims to control the tempo of the game and outpace the opponent before they can establish their own game plan. The inclusion of cards such as Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Azorius Charm helps to disrupt the opponent's strategy while cards like Champion of the Parish and Silverblade Paladin enhance the deck's offensive capabilities. With a mix of flying creatures and powerful combat tricks, this deck aims to go wide and go big to secure victory."

The deck aims to stall the opponent's strategy with cards like Detention Sphere and Supreme Verdict, while also generating card advantage with cards like Jace, Architect of Thought, and Tamiyo, the Moon Sage. The deck also has finishers like Angel of Serenity and Entreat the Angels to close out the game. The key is to disrupt the opponent's plans and outvalue them in the long game."
