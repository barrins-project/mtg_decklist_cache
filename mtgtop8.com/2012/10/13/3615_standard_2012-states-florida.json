            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing graveyard interaction and reanimation spells to bring powerful creatures into play quickly. By combining self-mill effects like Mulch and Grisly Salvage with reanimation spells like Unburial Rites, the deck aims to cheat big threats like Griselbrand, Gisela, and Angel of Serenity into play ahead of schedule. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Liliana of the Veil and removal spells like Dreadbore and Rolling Temblor to control the board while setting up its combo. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures and powerful effects."
