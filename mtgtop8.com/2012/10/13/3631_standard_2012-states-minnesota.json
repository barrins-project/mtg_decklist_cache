Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a flood of creatures and aggressive plays in order to secure a quick victory."

Thalia, Guardian of Thraben disrupts opponents' plans while cards like Loxodon Smiter and Thragtusk provide resilient threats. The deck aims to pressure opponents early on with aggressive creatures like Strangleroot Geist and Arbor Elf, and close out games with big finishers like Armada Wurm and Sublime Archangel. Gavony Township provides a way to further enhance the power of the deck's creatures, making it a formidable force in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
