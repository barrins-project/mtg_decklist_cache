Wild Defiance boosts your creatures and makes removal spells less effective against them. The deck is also packed with pump spells like Titanic Growth and Mutagenic Growth to increase your creature's power and close out the game swiftly. Overall, the key strategy is to win the game by dealing 10 poison counters to your opponent before they can stop you."
