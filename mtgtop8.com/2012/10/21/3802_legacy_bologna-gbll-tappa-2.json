The Stoneblade aspect comes from using Stoneforge Mystic to search for powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Batterskull to generate advantage in combat. The deck aims to disrupt opponents' strategies while slowly building up its own resources to eventually overwhelm them with a combination of efficient threats and card advantage."

The deck also incorporates card advantage and selection with spells like Ponder, Brainstorm, and Sylvan Library. Overall, the strategy is to quickly establish a threatening board presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan."

By using cards such as Faithless Looting, Entomb, Reanimate, and Exhume, the deck aims to put high-impact creatures like Sphinx of the Steel Wind, Iona, Shield of Emeria, and Griselbrand into play early on. It also includes disruption through cards like Thoughtseize and Duress to protect the combo. Overall, the key strategy is to use the graveyard as a resource to deploy powerful threats and overwhelm opponents."
