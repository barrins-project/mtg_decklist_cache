By playing efficient creatures with haste and burn spells that can target both creatures and players, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and win before they have a chance to stabilize. With a low mana curve and a high density of aggressive cards, this deck is designed to be fast and unforgiving, punishing opponents who stumble or take too long to establish their own game plan."
