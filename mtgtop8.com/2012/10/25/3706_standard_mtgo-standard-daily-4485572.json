Using a combination of counterspells, removal, and sweepers such as Supreme Verdict and Terminus, the deck aims to keep the opponent's threats in check. Lingering Souls, Jace, Architect of Thought, and Tamiyo, the Moon Sage provide card advantage and board presence. Sorin, Lord of Innistrad and Vault of the Archangel provide additional value and lifegain. Eventually, the deck looks to finish the game with a big Sphinx's Revelation or by chip damaging with Runechanter's Pike."
