The deck also aims to utilize cards like Snapcaster Mage and Restoration Angel to provide additional value and flexibility, while maintaining card advantage through effects like Ponder and Gitaxian Probe. The inclusion of Runechanter's Pike allows for additional aggression and the ability to close out games quickly."
