The deck also aims to pump up its creatures with Runechanter's Pike and close out the game with aggressive attacks. Snapcaster Mage and Restoration Angel offer additional flexibility and utility in the deck, allowing for extra spell recursion and protection. The mana base is optimized for a smooth curve of spells throughout the game."
