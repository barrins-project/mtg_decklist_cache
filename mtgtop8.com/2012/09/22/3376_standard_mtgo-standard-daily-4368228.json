The deck also features efficient mana acceleration with cards like Llanowar Elves and Birds of Paradise to cast powerful threats like Huntmaster of the Fells and Thragtusk ahead of curve. The inclusion of powerful equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine and Sword of War and Peace provides additional ways to enhance the creatures and push through for lethal damage."
