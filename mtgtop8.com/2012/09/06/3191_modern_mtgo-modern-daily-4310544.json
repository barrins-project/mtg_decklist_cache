            "notes": "This deck focuses on using creatures with infect to quickly deal damage to the opponent, while also utilizing pump spells to enhance the effectiveness of these creatures. The key strategy is to build a board presence of infect creatures like Glistener Elf and Blighted Agent, using protection spells like Vines of Vastwood to keep them safe, and then boosting their power with cards like Might of Old Krosa and Mutagenic Growth to finish off the opponent with poison counters. The mana base is designed to support this aggressive strategy with efficient land fetching and color fixing."
