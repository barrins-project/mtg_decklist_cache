The inclusion of Runechanter's Pike allows for additional damage output, while Snapcaster Mage and Gitaxian Probe provide card advantage and flexibility. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Mana Leak and Mental Misstep to control the opponent's plays. The mana base is optimized for casting spells consistently, with Seachrome Coast and Cavern of Souls providing color fixing."
