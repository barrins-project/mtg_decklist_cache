The deck focuses on bringing back powerful creatures like Sun Titan and Elesh Norn from the graveyard with cards like Unburial Rites and Lingering Souls. The deck also uses card draw and selection tools like Thought Scour and Forbidden Alchemy to find key pieces and maintain card advantage. With the ability to wipe the board with cards like Day of Judgment and protect its creatures with Vault of the Archangel, this deck aims to outlast and outvalue the opponent."
