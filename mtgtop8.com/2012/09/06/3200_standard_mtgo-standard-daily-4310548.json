With cards like Ponder, Thought Scour, and Snapcaster Mage for card draw and versatility, the deck can adapt to different situations and maintain its aggressive strategy. The inclusion of counterspells and removal spells like Negate, Mental Misstep, and Vapor Snag also allows for disruption and protection against opposing threats."
