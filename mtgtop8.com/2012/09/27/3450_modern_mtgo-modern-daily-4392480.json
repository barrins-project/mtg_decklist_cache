The deck then uses Scapeshift to sacrifice lands and search for more Mountains and Valakuts to deal lethal damage in one turn. Additionally, the deck includes control cards like Cryptic Command to protect itself and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The primary win condition is to use Scapeshift to search for multiple Valakuts and Mountains to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent."
