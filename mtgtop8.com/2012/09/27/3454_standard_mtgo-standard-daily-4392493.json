            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle using Zombie creatures. By utilizing cards like Gravecrawler and Geralf's Messenger, along with sacrifice outlets like Skirsdag High Priest and Falkenrath Aristocrat, the deck aims to deal consistent damage and control the board. The inclusion of removal spells and burn spells like Bonfire of the Damned and Go for the Throat adds versatility and ensures the opponent's creatures are kept in check. Ultimately, the goal is to chip away at the opponent's life total and secure a win through relentless aggression."
