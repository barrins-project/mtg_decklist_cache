            "notes": "The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's hand with discard spells before deploying efficient threats like Tarmogoyf, Kitchen Finks, Dark Confidant, and Bloodbraid Elf to apply pressure and close out the game quickly. Removal spells like Lightning Bolt, Terminate, and Maelstrom Pulse provide ways to deal with opposing threats, while cards like Liliana of the Veil and Jund Charm offer additional disruption and flexibility. The mana base of the deck is carefully constructed to support the diverse color requirements of its cards and maximize the efficiency of its plays."
