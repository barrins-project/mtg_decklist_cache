The goal is to swarm the board with creatures like Squadron Hawk and Ajani's Pridemate, overwhelming the opponent with a high life total and powerful attackers. It also includes removal with Path to Exile and disruption with Aven Mindcensor to control the pace of the game and ensure victory through aggressive plays."
