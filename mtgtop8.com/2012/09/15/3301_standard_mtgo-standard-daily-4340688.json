By utilizing cards like Delver of Secrets and Restoration Angel, the deck aims to quickly apply pressure to the opponent while disrupting their game plan with counterspells and removal. The inclusion of cards like Bonfire of the Damned allows for powerful board wipes to swing the game in your favor. The mana base is set up to ensure consistent access to all three colors required for the deck's spells."
