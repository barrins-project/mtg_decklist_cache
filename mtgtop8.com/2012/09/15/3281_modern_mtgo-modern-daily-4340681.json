It aims to create a loop where it can repeatedly bring back artifacts from the graveyard to generate more resources and eventually win the game through a massive Banefire. The key strategy is to utilize cards like Second Sunrise, Faith's Reward, and Krark-Clan Ironworks to continuously recycle artifacts and generate a large amount of mana to fuel the combo. The deck also includes cards like Terrarion and Ichor Wellspring to draw additional cards and keep the combo going."
