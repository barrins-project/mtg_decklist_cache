The creatures in the deck are efficient and powerful, with abilities that can help control the board or deal additional damage. The addition of cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Sword of War and Peace provide additional ways to pump up creatures and push through damage. Overall, this deck aims to establish a fast and powerful board presence to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
