By ramping up mana using cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Llanowar Elves, the deck aims to play threats like Thragtusk, Huntmaster of the Fells, and Strangleroot Geist early on. The inclusion of Swords of War and Peace and Feast and Famine provide additional damage and protection. The mana base is optimized for consistent access to all colors needed for the spells in the deck."
