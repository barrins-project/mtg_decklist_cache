The deck also utilizes efficient card drawing and graveyard interaction with cards like Ponder, Gitaxian Probe, and Snapcaster Mage. Restoration Angel provides additional value and tempo advantage, while Runechanter's Pike can turn any creature into a lethal threat. Overall, the key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently while maintaining card advantage and board presence."
