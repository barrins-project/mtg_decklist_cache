The deck also focuses on card advantage with spells like Gitaxian Probe and Snapcaster Mage, while also having equipment like Sword of War and Peace and Runechanter's Pike to increase the damage output of its creatures. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, evasive creatures and efficient spells."
