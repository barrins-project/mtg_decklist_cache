The deck aims to keep pressure on the opponent with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Burst Lightning, while also having flexible options like Vedalken Shackles and Cryptic Command for further control. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color identity, allowing for a variety of spells to be cast effectively."
