By utilizing efficient creatures like Strangleroot Geist and Huntmaster of the Fells, as well as powerful burn spells like Pillar of Flame and Bonfire of the Damned, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board control. The mana base is optimized for a smooth curve, with plenty of acceleration from Llanowar Elves and Birds of Paradise. With the ability to push damage through with Zealous Conscripts and Hellrider, the deck aims to close out games quickly and decisively."
