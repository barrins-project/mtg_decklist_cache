            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly building up storm count by casting spells that draw cards or produce mana, while also utilizing cards like Pyromancer Ascension and Past in Flames to increase spell effectiveness and recursion. The ultimate goal is to cast Grapeshot with a high storm count to deal a lethal amount of damage to the opponent in a single turn. The deck relies on careful sequencing of spells and mana management to generate the necessary resources for a successful combo finish."
