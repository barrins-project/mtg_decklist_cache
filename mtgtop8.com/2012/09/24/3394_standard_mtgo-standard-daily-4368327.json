            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly putting pressure on the opponent with efficient creatures and cheap spells. It utilizes cards like Delver of Secrets, Snapcaster Mage, and Geist of Saint Traft to quickly reduce the opponent's life total. The deck also includes countermagic and disruption spells to protect its threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of Runechanter's Pike allows for additional damage and a potential win condition. With a mix of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells, the deck aims to establish control of the game early and close out the match swiftly."
