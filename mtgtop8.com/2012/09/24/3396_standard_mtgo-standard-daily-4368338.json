By combining efficient removal spells with creatures that can sacrifice themselves for value, the deck aims to control the battlefield and continuously deal damage to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Blood Artist and Skirsdag High Priest also allows for incremental life gain and the ability to generate additional threats. With a mana base that supports the deck's color requirements, this zombie aggro deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its aggressive and synergistic strategy."

By playing mana accelerators like Llanowar Elves and Birds of Paradise, the deck aims to quickly deploy threats such as Huntmaster of the Fells and Wolfir Silverheart. The inclusion of burn spells like Pillar of Flame and Red Sun's Zenith provide additional reach to finish off opponents. The deck's mana base is carefully constructed to support the aggressive game plan, with cards like Kessig Wolf Run providing additional damage potential."
