Thragtusk, Solemn Simulacrum, Huntmaster of the Fells, and Primeval Titan provide value and stability on the board. Inferno Titan acts as a late-game win condition, while Kessig Wolf Run and Inkmoth Nexus offer additional ways to close out the game. The deck also includes lands that provide life gain and mana fixing for consistency."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly and aggressively attacking the opponent using cheap spells and creatures to deal damage and maintain control of the board. By using cards like Vapor Snag, Runechanter's Pike, and Snapcaster Mage, the deck aims to efficiently remove threats and protect its own creatures while dealing consistent damage. The inclusion of cards like Delver of Secrets and Invisible Stalker provides evasive threats that are difficult for opponents to deal with. The deck seeks to apply pressure early and close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
