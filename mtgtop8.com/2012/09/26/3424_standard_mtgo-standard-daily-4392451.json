Snapcaster Mage allows for the reuse of key spells, and Restoration Angel provides additional value by blinking creatures like Blade Splicer. Runechanter's Pike boosts the power of creatures while Thought Scour and Gitaxian Probe help to dig for important cards. This deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain board control to overwhelm the opponent."
