The inclusion of counterspells like Spellskite and Captain of the Mists provides additional flexibility in dealing with threats, while cards like Solemn Simulacrum and Rune-Scarred Demon offer card advantage and consistency. The deck's win condition is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and disrupt their game plan."
