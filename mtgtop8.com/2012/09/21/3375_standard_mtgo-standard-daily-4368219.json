The deck aims to stall the game using cards like Feeling of Dread and Pristine Talisman, while setting up powerful late-game plays with Entreat the Angels and Tamiyo, the Moon Sage. The deck also includes card draw and manipulation with Ponder, Think Twice, and Temporal Mastery. Overall, the deck focuses on maintaining control of the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with powerful angel tokens and planeswalkers."
