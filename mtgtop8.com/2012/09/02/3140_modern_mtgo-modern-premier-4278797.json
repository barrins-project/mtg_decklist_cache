This allows for casting powerful colorless spells like Karn Liberated and Wurmcoil Engine, while also having access to Emrakul, the Aeons Torn for a game-ending threat. The deck also includes card draw and selection with Expedition Map and Ancient Stirrings, as well as disruption with Pyroclasm and Relic of Progenitus to control the game until the big threats can come down."

Using cards like Second Sunrise and Faith's Reward, the deck can bring back multiple artifacts from the graveyard to generate more mana and card advantage. By utilizing cards like Krark-Clan Ironworks and Lotus Bloom, the deck aims to create a loop of sacrificing and returning artifacts to eventually cast a game-ending Banefire. The deck's strength lies in its ability to create explosive turns and overwhelm opponents with its combo potential."
