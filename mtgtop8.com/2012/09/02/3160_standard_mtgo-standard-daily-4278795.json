By utilizing mana acceleration from cards like Llanowar Elves and Birds of Paradise, the deck can bring out powerful threats early on and overwhelm the opponent. Cards like Hellrider and Zealous Conscripts provide additional reach and finisher potential, while removal spells like Pillar of Flame and Bonfire of the Damned help control the board. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, efficient, and relentless in its attacks."
