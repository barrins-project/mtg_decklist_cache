The deck also utilizes powerful creatures like Huntmaster of the Fells and Inferno Titan to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent. Kessig Wolf Run and Inkmoth Nexus provide additional win conditions by enabling creature pump and infect damage. The deck aims to outvalue opponents and control the flow of the game."
