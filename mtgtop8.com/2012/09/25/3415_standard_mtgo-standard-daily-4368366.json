Each creature poses a threat on its own, but when combined with the support cards, they become even more formidable. The inclusion of protection cards like Oblivion Ring and Fiend Hunter helps to control the opponent's board, allowing the aggressive creatures to attack freely. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of powerful creatures and efficient removal options."

Gut Shot and Mental Misstep can help deal with opposing threats, while Inkmoth Nexus and Cathedral of War provide alternative ways to deal infect damage.
