            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly build a board presence of aggressive zombie creatures while controlling the opponent's resources with removal spells and sacrificing effects. Using cards like Gravecrawler and Geralf's Messenger, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently, while also gaining incremental advantage with Blood Artist triggers. Phyrexian Obliterator serves as a powerful threat that can easily protect the player's life total. The deck is focused on overwhelming the opponent early on and maintaining pressure throughout the game."
