Talrand, Sky Summoner contributes to the aggressive strategy by creating flying tokens, supported by spells like Thought Scour to trigger prowess and draw cards. Runechanter's Pike enhances the power of these creatures, allowing for significant damage to be dealt in a short amount of time. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and relentless offensive strategy."
