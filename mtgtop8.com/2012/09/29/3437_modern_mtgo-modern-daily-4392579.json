The deck also includes cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to tutor for the Urza lands, along with powerful control elements like Karn Liberated, Oblivion Stone, and Relic of Progenitus to disrupt opponents' strategies and maintain board control. Additionally, the deck includes ramp spells like Explore and efficient card selection with Ancient Stirrings to quickly find key pieces of the deck."
