The deck uses cards like Lion's Eye Diamond, Lotus Petal, Rite of Flame, and Dark Ritual to produce mana, while cantrips like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Gitaxian Probe help dig for combo pieces. Burning Wish serves as a versatile tutor to fetch important spells from the sideboard while also triggering storm count. The goal is to storm off and win the game in a single explosive turn."

By utilizing cards like Force of Will, Counterspell, and Counterbalance, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also generating card advantage through cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Snapcaster Mage. The deck also has ways to stabilize the board with cards like Terminus and Swords to Plowshares, as well as win conditions in the form of Entreat the Angels. The deck's consistency is further enhanced by Sensei's Divining Top and can control the board with cards like Engineered Explosives."

This deck aims to utilize the powerful card Omniscience to cast spells for free, while also using Burning Wish to tutor for specific cards from the sideboard. The deck focuses on assembling the combo pieces quickly and efficiently in order to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
