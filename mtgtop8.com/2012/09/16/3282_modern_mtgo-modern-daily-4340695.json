            "notes": "This deck focuses on assembling the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Tower, Power Plant, and Mine) to generate large amounts of mana to cast massive Eldrazi creatures such as Emrakul and Ulamog. It also includes key control elements like Remand, Pyroclasm, and Thirst for Knowledge to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win condition. Through the Breach allows for a sneaky way to cheat out one of the Eldrazi creatures for a game-ending play. Overall, the strategy revolves around controlling the game until it can unleash its powerful threats for a quick victory."
