By boosting their power and resilience with cards like Honor of the Pure and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, as well as protecting them with Grand Abolisher, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence. Ajani, Caller of the Pride provides additional support and synergy with the creature-heavy strategy. With a low mana curve and a focus on efficiency, this deck looks to outpace and outmaneuver opponents in a direct, aggressive manner."
