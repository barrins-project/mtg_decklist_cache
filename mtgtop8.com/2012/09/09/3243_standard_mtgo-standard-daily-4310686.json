Cards like Wild Defiance and Cathedral of War boost the damage output, while spells like Titanic Growth and Rancor provide additional buffs. The deck also includes protection in the form of Apostle's Blessing and Mental Misstep, allowing the player to push through any blockers or removal spells. Overall, the deck aims to win the game by infecting the opponent before they can mount a defense."
