Birthing Pod allows for creature tutoring and can generate value by sacrificing smaller creatures for larger ones. The combination of Blood Artist and sacrifice effects creates a steady stream of life drain for the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient creature-based strategy."
