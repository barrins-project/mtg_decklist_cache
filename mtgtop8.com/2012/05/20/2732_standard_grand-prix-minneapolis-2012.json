By combining small, evasive creatures like Invisible Stalker and Delver of Secrets with burn spells like Pillar of Flame and Incinerate, the deck aims to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. Snapcaster Mage serves as both a creature and a way to reuse powerful spells from the graveyard, while cards like Runechanter's Pike and Devil's Play provide late-game reach and versatility. Overall, the deck aims to be fast and aggressive, overwhelming the opponent before they can mount a defense."

The creatures in the deck are hard to deal with due to hexproof or evasion abilities, allowing them to attack consistently and put pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to quickly close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize, making it a fast and aggressive strategy."
