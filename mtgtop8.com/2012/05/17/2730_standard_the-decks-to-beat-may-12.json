By playing low-cost creatures like Champion of the Parish and Stormblood Berserker, supported by anthems like Honor of the Pure and equipment like Sword of War and Peace, the deck aims to quickly build a wide board presence and deal significant damage early in the game. With the ability to protect its creatures with Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Fiend Hunter, this deck is designed to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out games swiftly."
