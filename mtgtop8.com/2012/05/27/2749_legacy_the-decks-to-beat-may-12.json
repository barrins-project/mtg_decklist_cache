Once your graveyard is full, you can use cards like Dread Return to bring back powerful creatures from the graveyard, triggering Bridge from Below to create zombie tokens. The deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with a large number of creatures and zombie tokens, combining speed and graveyard manipulation to achieve victory."
