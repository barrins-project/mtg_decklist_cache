The inclusion of equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine and Sword of War and Peace provide additional combat power and protection. The deck also features card advantage with Snapcaster Mage and Gitaxian Probe, as well as some graveyard interaction with Moorland Haunt. The mana base ensures consistent casting of spells and creatures."
