The deck also focuses on sacrificing creatures for value, whether it be through triggers from cards like Blood Artist and Diregraf Captain or using effects like Tragic Slip and Mortarpod. The inclusion of Phyrexian Obliterator provides a powerful threat that can quickly end the game if left unchecked. Liliana of the Veil adds disruption and control elements to the strategy."
