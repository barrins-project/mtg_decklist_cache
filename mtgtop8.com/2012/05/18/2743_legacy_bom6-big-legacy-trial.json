The strategy revolves around manipulating the game to cheat out these powerful creatures earlier than normal, overwhelming the opponent with their sheer power and abilities. The deck also includes disruption spells like Force of Will, Spell Pierce, and Daze to protect the combo pieces and ensure they can be successfully put into play. The goal is to win the game quickly through the use of these high-impact creatures."
