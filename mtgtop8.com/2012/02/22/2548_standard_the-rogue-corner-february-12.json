            "notes": "The main idea of this Boros Control deck is to use a combination of removal spells, artifact creatures, and equipment to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Cards like Day of Judgment and Oblivion Ring remove threats from the battlefield, while cards like Glint Hawk Idol and Wurmcoil Engine provide threats of your own. Equipment like Sword of War and Peace and Sword of Feast and Famine can help increase your own creature's power while disrupting your opponent's plans. Overall, this deck aims to establish control of the game and win through attrition."
