Using cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, the deck aims to generate a lot of mana and play multiple threats each turn. With the ability to sacrifice artifacts like Arcbound Ravager for added benefits, this deck is designed to apply pressure early and maintain a dominant board presence throughout the game."
