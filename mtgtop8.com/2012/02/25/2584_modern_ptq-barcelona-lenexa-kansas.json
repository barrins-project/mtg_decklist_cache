Using cards like Steel Overseer to pump up creatures and Shrapnel Blast for direct damage, the deck aims to be aggressive and fast-paced. With cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum for mana acceleration, the deck also aims to have a consistent and quick start to put pressure on the opponent early in the game."
