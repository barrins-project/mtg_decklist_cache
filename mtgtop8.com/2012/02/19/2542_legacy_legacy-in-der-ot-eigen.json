By utilizing efficient creatures like Nimble Mongoose, Delver of Secrets, and Tarmogoyf, along with powerful disruption spells like Daze, Force of Will, and Stifle, this deck aims to control the pace of the game and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays. With a good balance of early game threats and control elements, this deck is designed to keep the opponent on the back foot while setting up for a quick victory."

It also aims to generate value through recursion with cards like Eternal Witness and Sun Titan. The deck looks to control the board with powerful threats like Thrun, the Last Troll and Spiritmonger, while also gaining incremental advantage with cards like Veteran Explorer and Kitchen Finks. The inclusion of Nic Fit allows for the deck to generate additional mana and play its threats ahead of schedule, giving it a significant advantage in the late game."
