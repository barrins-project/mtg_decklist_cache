The key strategy is to play aggressively and efficiently to deal damage as quickly as possible, while also using cards like Arcbound Ravager and Vault Skirge for additional versatility and resilience. The deck's synergy between creatures, artifacts, and lands allows for a fast-paced, aggressive playstyle that can overwhelm opponents before they have a chance to fully develop their own game plan."
