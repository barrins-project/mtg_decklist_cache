The synergy between cards like Steel Overseer, Arcbound Ravager, and Ornithopter allows for explosive plays and the potential for unexpected combos. With a mix of evasion from flyers like Vault Skirge and Inkmoth Nexus, along with direct damage from cards like Galvanic Blast and Shrapnel Blast, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents early in the game before they have a chance to establish their own board presence."
