The deck includes cards like Goblin Guide, Tarmogoyf, and Stormblood Berserker to apply pressure, supported by burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike to close out the game. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Blood Moon and Shrine of Burning Rage provide disruption and additional damage to cement the aggro strategy. The deck aims to end the game as quickly as possible through a combination of creature attacks and direct damage spells."
