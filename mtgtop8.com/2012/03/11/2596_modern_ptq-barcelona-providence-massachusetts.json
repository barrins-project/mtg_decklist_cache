The deck also includes control elements like Spellskite and Dispel to protect the combo pieces, as well as removal like Flame Slash to deal with opposing threats. Card selection through cards like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand helps to find the combo pieces faster. Overall, the deck aims to assemble the combo quickly and protect it long enough to secure victory."
