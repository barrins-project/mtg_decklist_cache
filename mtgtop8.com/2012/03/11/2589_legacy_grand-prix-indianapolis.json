The key strategy is to rapidly fill your graveyard with cards like Stinkweed Imp and Golgari Grave-Troll, triggering abilities such as Bridge from Below and Flayer of the Hatebound. By utilizing cards like Faithless Looting and Careful Study, you can set up your graveyard quickly and overwhelm your opponent with an army of resurrected creatures for a powerful and explosive combo finish."

It also aims to generate advantage with cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Sylvan Library, while controlling the opponent's resources with cards like Gaddock Teeg and Aven Mindcensor. The lands in the deck are carefully selected to provide consistency and utility, with cards like Wasteland and Maze of Ith disrupting the opponent's mana base. Ultimately, the deck aims to pressure the opponent early and disrupt their game plan to secure a victory."
