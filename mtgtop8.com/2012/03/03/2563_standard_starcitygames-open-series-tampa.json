The deck aims to control the game through card advantage and strong removal options like Tragic Slip and Black Sun's Zenith. It also utilizes graveyard recursion with cards like Forbidden Alchemy and Snapcaster Mage to maintain a steady flow of resources. Additionally, cards like Ghost Quarter and Nephalia Drownyard provide utility against troublesome lands or graveyard strategies. Overall, this deck focuses on outlasting opponents and grinding out wins through attrition."

Additionally, cards like Thrun, the Last Troll provide resilience against removal spells, while Galvanic Blast and Slagstorm help to control the board and deal with opposing threats. The deck's powerful threats and removal spells make it difficult for opponents to keep up and ultimately lead to victory through overwhelming force."
