Mother of Runes and Spellskite provide additional protection for key creatures, while cards like Path to Exile and Swords to Plowshares help control the opponent's board. Overall, the strategy is to maintain a strong, consistent offensive presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan."

The key is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures like Sphinx of the Steel Wind and Inkwell Leviathan, while also disrupting their game plan with counterspells like Daze and Force of Will. The deck aims to win the game through a strong tempo advantage and overwhelming board presence."
