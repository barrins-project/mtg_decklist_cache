The deck utilizes cantrips and card draw to find key pieces while maintaining a low mana curve. With careful sequencing and resource management, the UR Storm deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a flurry of spells in a single turn."

The deck's goal is to assemble the pieces of the combo and execute it in a single explosive turn to overwhelm the opponent and secure a victory."
