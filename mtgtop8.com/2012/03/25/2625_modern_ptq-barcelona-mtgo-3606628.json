The deck also includes control elements like Pyroclasm and Oblivion Stone to disrupt the opponent's board state, with Ancient Stirrings and Expedition Map helping to find the necessary pieces for the Tron combo. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big threats and powerful control elements."

To support this strategy, the deck includes cards like Street Wraith and Monstrous Carabid for cycling, as well as cards like Demonic Dread and Violent Outburst to cascade into Living End. Additionally, there are cards like Fulminator Mage and Beast Within to disrupt the opponent's board while setting up for the combo. The deck's goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a sudden influx of creatures and win the game quickly."
