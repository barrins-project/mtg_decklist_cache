Delver of Secrets provides an early threat while Snapcaster Mage offers flexibility by reusing spells from the graveyard. The deck aims to control the tempo of the game using countermagic like Mana Leak and card draw/filtering with cards like Ponder and Gitaxian Probe. Sword of War and Peace provides additional damage and protection. The mana base is streamlined for consistency and Moorland Haunt provides late-game advantage."
