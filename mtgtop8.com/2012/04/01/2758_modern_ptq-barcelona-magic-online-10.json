This mana is then used to cast huge threats like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre. The deck also includes versatile cards like Ancient Stirrings and Expedition Map to help find the necessary pieces, while control elements like Pyroclasm and Oblivion Stone help to keep the opponent's board in check. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with massive threats while controlling the game."
