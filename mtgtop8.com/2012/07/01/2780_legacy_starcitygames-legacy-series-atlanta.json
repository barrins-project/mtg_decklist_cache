By using disruptive creatures like Cursecatcher and Spellstutter Sprite, along with control elements like Force of Will and Daze, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents while maintaining a stable board presence. Aether Vial allows for quick creature deployment, while Standstill can slow down opponents and draw extra cards. The deck's mana base includes Cavern of Souls and Wasteland to support its aggressive strategy."
