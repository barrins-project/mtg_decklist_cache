The deck focuses on ramping up mana with Avacyn's Pilgrim and Birds of Paradise to play powerful threats like Huntmaster of the Fells and Restoration Angel. Gavony Township can further boost the team of creatures, and Bonfire of the Damned provides a versatile board wipe option if needed. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats and resilient creatures."
