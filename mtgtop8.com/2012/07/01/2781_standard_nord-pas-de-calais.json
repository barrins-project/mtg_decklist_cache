The deck also includes cards like Snapcaster Mage to reuse spells from the graveyard and Restoration Angel for additional value. The key strategy is to efficiently use mana and play threats while disrupting the opponent's game plan, ultimately aiming to win the game before the opponent can stabilize or mount a meaningful defense."
