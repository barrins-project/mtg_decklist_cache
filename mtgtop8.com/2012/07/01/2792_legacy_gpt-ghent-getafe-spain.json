The key strategy is to cheat powerful creatures into play early in the game, overwhelming the opponent with threats that are difficult to deal with, such as Griselbrand or Elesh Norn. The deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to respond."

Sulfuric Vortex and Volcanic Fallout help maintain pressure on the opponent while cards like Grim Lavamancer and Goblin Guide provide consistent damage. Price of Progress punishes opponents for playing nonbasic lands, and Fireblast can provide a powerful finisher. The deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total before they can stabilize, utilizing a mix of direct damage and aggressive creatures to secure victory."
