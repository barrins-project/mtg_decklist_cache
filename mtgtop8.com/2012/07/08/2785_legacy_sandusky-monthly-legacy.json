The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a massive board state and either use Mirror Entity to buff all creatures or cycle through the deck with Regal Force to find lethal. The deck also utilizes Green Sun's Zenith to tutor for specific Elves or combo pieces as needed. The deck's strength lies in its ability to combo off quickly and efficiently, overwhelming opponents before they have a chance to react."

It includes cards like Life from the Loam and Exploration to maximize land plays, while also using Raven's Crime and Intuition to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also includes Zuran Orb and Glacial Chasm for protection, alongside cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port for land destruction. Additionally, the deck utilizes Crucible of Worlds and Manabond to gain an advantage by constantly replaying lands from the graveyard. The key strategy is to establish land dominance and control the game through resource management."
