Once on the battlefield, the Goblins are able to generate value through card draw and deal damage efficiently with cards like Goblin Piledriver and Siege-Gang Commander. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Wasteland and Rishadan Port to disrupt opponents' mana base and keep them on the defensive. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast, relentless onslaught of creatures."
