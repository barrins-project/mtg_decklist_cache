By utilizing cards that can pump up creatures like Invisible Stalker and Delver of Secrets, the deck aims to deal damage efficiently and protect its threats. The inclusion of Runechanter's Pike allows for additional damage output and the potential to close out games quickly. Overall, the goal is to maintain a strong offensive presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
