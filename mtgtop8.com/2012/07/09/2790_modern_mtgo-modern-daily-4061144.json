            "notes": "The deck focuses on casting a high number of spells in a single turn to generate mana and eventually finish off the opponent with a large Grapeshot. The key strategy involves using cards like Seething Song, Pyretic Ritual, and Desperate Ritual to generate mana quickly, while also utilizing spells like Manamorphose and Gitaxian Probe to draw through the deck. Past in Flames allows for the recycling of previously cast spells, while cards like Thought Scour and Serum Visions help dig for key combo pieces. Lightning Bolt provides some removal and can also be used to finish off the opponent if needed."
