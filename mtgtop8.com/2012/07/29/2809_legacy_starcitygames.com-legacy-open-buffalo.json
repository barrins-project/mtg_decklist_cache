The deck also utilizes cantrips like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain to dig for combo pieces, along with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze for protection. The inclusion of Burning Wish provides additional access to key combo pieces from the sideboard while Jace, the Mind Sculptor offers card advantage and control elements. The deck aims to win the game by dropping high-impact threats early and overwhelming the opponent."

This allows for explosive plays and combos, especially when combined with cards like Bridge from Below and Dread Return. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent by generating a large number of tokens and utilizing efficient discard outlets like Faithless Looting and Cabal Therapy. The deck also includes cards that provide additional utility and protection, ensuring its viability in various matchups."
