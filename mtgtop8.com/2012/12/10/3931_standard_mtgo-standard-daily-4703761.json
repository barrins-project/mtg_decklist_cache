This combo allows for explosive plays and can overwhelm the opponent with a board full of creatures. The deck also utilizes cards like Chronic Flooding and Izzet Staticaster for control and removal, while Huntmaster of the Fells provides additional value. Overall, the goal is to reanimate multiple creatures quickly and efficiently to outpace the opponent."
