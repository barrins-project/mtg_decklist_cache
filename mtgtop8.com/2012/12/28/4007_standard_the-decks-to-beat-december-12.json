It aims to maintain board presence with powerful creatures like Thragtusk and Restoration Angel while disruption opponent's strategies with cards like Dissipate and Detention Sphere. The goal is to stall the game until the player can overwhelm the opponent with card advantage and efficient threats. The mana base is designed for consistency and allows for a variety of spells to be cast reliably. Overall, the deck thrives on controlling the pace of the game and outvaluing the opponent."

It then uses Unburial Rites to bring back powerful creatures like Angel of Serenity and Craterhoof Behemoth from the graveyard to the battlefield. It also takes advantage of mana acceleration with Arbor Elf and Avacyn's Pilgrim to cast big creatures earlier. The deck also includes some lifegain with Centaur Healer and Thragtusk to help survive until the combo is set up. The key concept is to utilize the graveyard and reanimation spells to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly flooding the board with low-cost creatures, taking advantage of their synergy and abilities to overwhelm the opponent. With a strong emphasis on aggressive plays and pushing damage early on, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence that is difficult for the opponent to deal with effectively. The creatures in the deck are supported by spells like Rally the Peasants to grant them additional power and abilities, making them even more difficult to handle for the opponent. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistent and efficient deployment of threats."
