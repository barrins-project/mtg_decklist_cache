By utilizing cards like Gitaxian Probe, Ponder, and Thought Scour to dig for answers, along with disruption from Mana Leak and Vapor Snag, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with evasive threats and card advantage from Snapcaster Mage. Restoration Angel provides additional value and protection, while Runechanter's Pike acts as a powerful finisher for the deck."
