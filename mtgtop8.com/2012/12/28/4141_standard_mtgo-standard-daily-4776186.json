The key strategy is to aggressively play ramp spells like Farseek to hit land drops and cast powerful threats like Thragtusk, Restoration Angel, and Angel of Serenity. Additionally, burn spells like Searing Spear can provide direct damage or removal while also enabling other aggressive strategies. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient threats and removal, ultimately securing victory through a combination of aggression and board control."
