By playing cards like Delver of Secrets, Nivmagus Elemental, and Snapcaster Mage alongside cheap instants like Lightning Bolt, Gut Shot, and Daze, the deck aims to control the board while building up resources. The deck also includes disruptive spells like Flusterstorm and Gigadrowse to protect its combo pieces. By efficiently manipulating the top of the deck with Brainstorm and Ponder, and using cards like Clout of the Dominus to enhance its creatures, this deck seeks to overwhelm opponents with its powerful synergy and explosive plays."
