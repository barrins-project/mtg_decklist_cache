This is achieved through a combination of powerful creatures like Thragtusk and Restoration Angel, targeted removal spells like Ultimate Price, and versatile spells like Bonfire of the Damned and Rakdos's Return. The deck also utilizes mana acceleration with cards like Farseek and Avacyn's Pilgrim to quickly ramp up to powerful threats like Garruk, Primal Hunter and Huntmaster of the Fells. Overall, the goal is to outvalue and outlast the opponent in a slower, more strategic match."
