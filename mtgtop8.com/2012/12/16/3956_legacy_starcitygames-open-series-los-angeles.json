Force of Will and Daze provide protection and counterspell options. Abrupt Decay handles problematic permanents. Wasteland acts as land destruction. The deck also utilizes the graveyard with cards like Tombstalker, Tarmogoyf, and Deathrite Shaman. Overall, the goal is to apply pressure, disrupt the opponent, and maintain board control for a strong midrange playstyle."

The main creatures in the deck, including Gravecrawler, Deathrite Shaman, and Bloodghast, provide constant pressure and can be sacrificed for additional benefits."
