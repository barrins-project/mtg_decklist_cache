The deck aims to ramp up its mana quickly with Farseek and other ramp spells, then play threats like Thragtusk and Olivia Voldaren to gain board advantage. Nightshade Peddler and Izzet Staticaster provide removal options, while Huntmaster of the Fells generates value over time. The deck also includes cards like Deathrite Shaman and Rakdos's Return to disrupt the opponent's game plan and close out the game."
