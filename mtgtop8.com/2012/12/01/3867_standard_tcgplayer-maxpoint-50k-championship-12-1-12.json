This allows the player to overwhelm their opponent with powerful creatures such as Thragtusk, Angel of Serenity, and Craterhoof Behemoth. Lingering Souls provides additional creature tokens for defense and offense, while cards like Sever the Bloodline and Sigarda, Host of Herons help to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Gavony Township can also be used to pump up the team of creatures for a final push for victory."
