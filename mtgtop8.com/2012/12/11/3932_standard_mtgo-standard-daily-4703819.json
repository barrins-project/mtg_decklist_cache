            "notes": "The key strategy of this deck is to fill the graveyard with powerful creatures using cards like Mulch and Grisly Salvage, and then bring them back into play using the combo of Unburial Rites and Angel of Serenity. Thragtusk and Craterhoof Behemoth serve as the primary reanimation targets, with Restoration Angel providing additional value and Centaur Healer helping to stabilize against aggressive decks. The mana base is built to support the large number of green and white spells, with a splash of black for the reanimation package. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with massive creatures in the mid-to-late game."
