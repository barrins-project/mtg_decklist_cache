It aims to maintain board control by wiping the board with Supreme Verdict and using Detention Sphere to deal with problematic permanents. Lingering Souls provides a steady stream of blockers while also acting as a win condition. The deck also includes card draw in the form of Sphinx's Revelation and Forbidden Alchemy to outvalue the opponent. Overall, the key concept is to stall the game and outvalue the opponent through efficient control and card advantage."
