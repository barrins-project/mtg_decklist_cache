By using sacrifice outlets like Bloodthrone Vampire and Blood Artist, the deck can generate additional value while dealing damage. The deck also includes removal spells like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame to control the board. The mana base includes both lands that produce black and red mana to ensure consistent casting of spells. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and efficient threats."
