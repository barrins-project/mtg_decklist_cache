The deck also focuses on card advantage and life gain with cards like Sphinx's Revelation and Thragtusk. The deck includes efficient creatures like Restoration Angel and Borderland Ranger to help stabilize the board, while also including powerful finishers like Sigarda, Host of Herons and Angel of Serenity. The mana base is constructed to support the three colors of the deck efficiently."
