The deck aims to flood the board quickly with threats like Diregraf Ghoul, Geralf's Messenger, and Gravecrawler. Blood Artist provides additional value by draining life from opponents whenever creatures die. Falkenrath Aristocrat acts as a powerful finisher, while Hellrider boosts the entire team's damage output. The deck includes various removal spells, such as Brimstone Volley and Searing Spear, to clear the way for attacks. The use of black and red mana sources allows for flexibility in casting spells."
