It aims to control the board early with efficient creatures like Rakdos Cackler and Stromkirk Noble, then finish off the opponent with powerful finishers like Thundermaw Hellkite and Falkenrath Aristocrat. The inclusion of burn spells like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame helps to clear blockers and provide additional reach. The deck also utilizes lands like Cavern of Souls and Cathedral of War to ensure its creatures can't be countered and deal maximum damage."
