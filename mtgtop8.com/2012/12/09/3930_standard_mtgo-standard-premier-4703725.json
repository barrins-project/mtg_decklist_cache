Thalia, Guardian of Thraben disrupts opponent's spellcasting, while Restoration Angel provides additional value through blinking creatures. Zealous Conscripts and Fiend Hunter offer versatile removal options, and Garruk Relentless provides card advantage and token production. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early on and maintain pressure throughout the game, using powerful creatures and synergistic cards to secure victory."
