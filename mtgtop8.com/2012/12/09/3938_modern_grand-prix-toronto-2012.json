The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by using cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to strip their hand, while also removing threats with Lightning Bolt and Dismember. Additionally, the deck utilizes creatures like Tarmogoyf, Thundermaw Hellkite, and Bloodbraid Elf to quickly close out the game. The mana base includes a mix of fetchlands and shocklands to ensure consistent color access and to fuel the graveyard abilities of Deathrite Shaman."

The deck also leverages powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to disrupt opponents' resources and generate value. The deck aims to maintain tempo and pressure opponents with aggressive plays while disrupting their game plan, ultimately aiming to outpace and overwhelm them."

With cards like Path to Exile and Detention Sphere for removal, and counterspells like Supreme Verdict and Wall of Omens to control the board, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage with cards like Jace, Architect of Thought and Lingering Souls. Additionally, the deck utilizes mana acceleration with artifacts like Azorius Signet and Talisman of Progress to quickly cast its powerful spells and close out the game with resilient threats like Batterskull and Gideon Jura."
