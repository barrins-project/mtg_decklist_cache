The deck also includes powerful finishers like Hellrider and Thundermaw Hellkite to close out games. Additionally, having cards like Stonewright to pump up creatures and Knight of Infamy to protect against removal spells helps to maintain pressure on the opponent. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to aggressively attack the opponent and quickly end the game."
