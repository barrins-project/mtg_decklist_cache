The inclusion of burn spells like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame helps to deal with opposing creatures or burn the opponent directly. The deck focuses on applying constant pressure and closing out games before the opponent can stabilize."

It combines the efficient early drops with powerful mid-to-late game threats to keep up the pressure and outvalue the opponent. The mana base allows for flexibility in casting spells of different colors, and the inclusion of cards like Thragtusk and Restoration Angel provide both resilience and additional value. The deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize, and to keep up the pressure throughout the match."
