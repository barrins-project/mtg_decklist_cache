The goal is to outvalue the opponent by efficiently dealing with threats and generating card advantage through cards like Supreme Verdict, Detention Sphere, Lingering Souls, and Sphinx's Revelation. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Tamiyo, Sorin, and Jace allows for additional card advantage and flexibility in handling different situations. By managing resources effectively and disrupting the opponent's game plan, this deck aims to secure victory through attrition and strategic decision-making."
