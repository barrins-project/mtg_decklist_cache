Burn at the Stake is a finisher card that can deal massive damage if enough creatures are on the battlefield. The deck also includes counterspells and card draw to maintain control over the game."

Utilizing cards like Knight of Glory, Mayor of Avabruck, and Restoration Angel, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm opponents with a mix of creatures and direct damage spells like Bonfire of the Damned. Gavony Township and Cavern of Souls provide additional support and protection for the creatures, allowing them to quickly build a strong board presence and close out games before the opponent can respond effectively."
