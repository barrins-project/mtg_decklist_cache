The goal is to apply pressure early on and keep the opponent on the back foot, using cards like Bump in the Night, Lightning Bolt, and Goblin Guide to keep up the aggression. The deck aims to end the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize or gain control, utilizing a mix of direct damage spells and fast creatures to overwhelm the opponent."
