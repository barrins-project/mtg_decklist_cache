The inclusion of cards like Traitorous Blood and Mark of Mutiny allows for stealing opponent's creatures to further enhance the attacks. The deck also features some powerful finishers like Thundermaw Hellkite and Falkenrath Aristocrat. The mana base is optimized for a mix of Mountain and Swamp lands, with some dual lands like Dragonskull Summit and Cavern of Souls for consistency."

Geist of Saint Traft and Dungeon Geists provide strong attacking threats, backed up by the versatile Restoration Angel. Thundermaw Hellkite can serve as a finisher to quickly close out the game. The mana base is optimized to support the Jeskai color identity, allowing for consistent casting of spells across all three colors."
