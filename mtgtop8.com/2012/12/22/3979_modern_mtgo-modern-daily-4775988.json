By utilizing cards like Lightning Bolt and Thoughtseize to control the opponent's board while deploying threats like Tarmogoyf and Bloodbraid Elf, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. Additionally, the deck includes versatile removal options like Terminate and Maelstrom Pulse to handle any threats the opponent may present. With a solid mana base and a mix of aggression and disruption, this deck aims to win through a combination of early damage and late-game card advantage."
