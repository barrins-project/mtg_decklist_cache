By utilizing the Scapeshift card in combination with a deck comprised entirely of Forests, the goal is to ramp up mana quickly and then overwhelm the opponent by sacrificing a critical mass of lands to search for and put into play multiple win conditions. This deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win condition for a decisive victory."

The deck also includes utility cards like Relic of Progenitus and Spellskite to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The end goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn or Sundering Titan while maintaining control of the game through various removal and disruption spells."
