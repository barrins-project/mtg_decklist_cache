By utilizing cards like Snapcaster Mage and Restoration Angel to replay powerful spells, as well as cards like Lingering Souls and Runechanter's Pike to create a wide board presence or enhance creatures, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and close out the game quickly. The inclusion of cards like Sphinx's Revelation and Supreme Verdict provides additional options for card advantage and board control."
