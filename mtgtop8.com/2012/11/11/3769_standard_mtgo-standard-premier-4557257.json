By playing aggressive creatures like Champion of the Parish and Mayor of Avabruck early on, and then boosting them with cards like Silverblade Paladin and Sublime Archangel, you can deal a lot of damage quickly. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben also helps slow down your opponent's spells while your creatures continue to pressure them. This deck aims to win fast and decisively through a strong creature-based strategy."
