This allows for powerful combo plays, especially with creatures like Thragtusk, Angel of Serenity, and Griselbrand. The deck also includes some disruption cards like Sever the Bloodline to control the opponent's board, as well as ramp cards like Mulch and Grisly Salvage to help accelerate the reanimation process. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and combo plays."
