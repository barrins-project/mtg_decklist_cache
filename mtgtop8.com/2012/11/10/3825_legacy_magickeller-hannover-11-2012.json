The goal is to disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up your own win condition, such as using Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas or Jace, the Mind Sculptor to outvalue them. With a mix of removal, card draw, and threats, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and secure a victory through superior control of the game."

The goal is to then use this mana to power out Goblin Charbelcher and activate its ability to deal lethal damage to the opponent. Additional cards like Land Grant and Gitaxian Probe help to dig for combo pieces while Empty the Warrens provides an alternative win condition. The deck aims to win the game explosively and efficiently."
