By manipulating extra turns through cards like Time Warp and Temporal Mastery, the deck aims to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells. The inclusion of counterspells like Remand and Spell Snare helps protect the combo pieces. The deck also utilizes card draw and manipulation to consistently find the necessary pieces to execute the combo efficiently."
