By using cards like Unsummon, Thought Scour, and Augur of Bolas to disrupt the opponent's plans and dig for key pieces, combined with creatures like Restoration Angel and Runechanter's Pike to apply pressure and close out the game quickly. The deck also includes some counter spells and card draw options to help maintain tempo and outmaneuver the opponent. Overall, it aims to outpace and outsmart the opponent to secure victory."
