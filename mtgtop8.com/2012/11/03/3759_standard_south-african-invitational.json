This is supported by disruptive spells like Azorius Charm, Detention Sphere, and Feeling of Dread to control the opponent's board and tempo. The inclusion of versatile cards like Snapcaster Mage and Restoration Angel allows for flexibility in gameplay. Additionally, counter spells like Negate, Syncopate, and Essence Scatter provide protection and disruption. The mana base is carefully crafted to ensure smooth mana curve and consistency in casting spells."
