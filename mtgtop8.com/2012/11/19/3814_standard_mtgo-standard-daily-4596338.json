By utilizing cards like Champion of the Parish and Gather the Townsfolk to create a strong board presence early on, and supporting them with powerful creature buffs such as Mikaeus, the Lunarch and Gavony Township, the deck aims to close out the game swiftly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Restoration Angel also help disrupt the opponent's strategy and provide additional versatility in combat."
