Cards like Manamorphose and rituals help to generate mana, while Pyromancer Ascension and Past in Flames allow for spells to be recast from the graveyard. The key goal is to build up a critical mass of spells before finishing off the opponent with Grapeshot or another direct damage spell. The deck aims to combo off quickly and overwhelm the opponent before they can mount a defense."
