By consistently applying pressure and maintaining board control, the deck aims to finish the game swiftly before the opponent can stabilize. The curve is kept low to ensure a steady stream of threats and damage output, while the mana base is streamlined to support the aggressive strategy. Overall, this deck is designed to be fast, relentless, and punishing to opponents who cannot keep up with its pace."

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures like Thragtusk and Restoration Angel, while also having access to powerful finishers like Angel of Serenity and Sigarda, Host of Herons. The inclusion of cards like Garruk, Primal Hunter and Lingering Souls provides card advantage and resilience against removal, allowing the deck to maintain pressure and close out games efficiently."

The key strategy involves using cards like Restoration Angel and Angel of Serenity to combo with powerful creatures like Craterhoof Behemoth for a game-ending attack. Additionally, the deck includes mana accelerators like Avacyn's Pilgrim and Arbor Elf to ramp up towards casting these high-cost creatures quickly. The reanimation aspect of the deck adds a unique twist to traditional creature-based strategies."
