The inclusion of cards like Thundermaw Hellkite and Hellrider provide additional reach and can quickly close out games. The mana base is designed to support the Rakdos color combination and ensure consistent casting of spells."

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a wide board presence and the ability to quickly buff tokens for powerful attacks.
