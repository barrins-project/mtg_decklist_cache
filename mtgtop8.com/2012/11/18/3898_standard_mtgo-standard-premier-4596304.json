By ramping into threats like Thragtusk and Restoration Angel, as well as card advantage engines like Garruk and Tamiyo, the deck aims to generate incremental advantages and eventually overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of board wipes like Supreme Verdict and Terminus provides additional control options, while cards like Lingering Souls and Sphinx's Revelation offer flexibility and card advantage. This deck thrives on efficient removal, card draw, and resilient threats to outlast opponents in a long game."
