This is achieved by buffing up these creatures with pump spells like Might of Old Krosa and Mutagenic Growth, protecting them with Ranger's Guile and Vines of Vastwood, and ensuring unblockability with Inkmoth Nexus. The deck aims to win by utilizing the infect mechanic to bypass traditional life total win conditions and secure victory."

The deck aims to pressure opponents early with aggressive creatures and finish the game quickly with burn spells and evasive threats like Delver of Secrets. By smoothly transitioning between offense and defense, the deck aims to keep opponents on the back foot while closing out the game before they can stabilize. The balance of aggression and control in this deck allows for adaptability to various matchups and strategies."

It aims to control the game early by countering or removing threats with spells like Spell Snare, Spell Pierce, and Mana Leak, while also having the potential to steal or control the opponent's creatures with Vedalken Shackles and Cryptic Command. The deck also includes a mix of efficient creatures like Tarmogoyf and Delver of Secrets, as well as versatile removal and burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Burst Lightning."
