Additionally, Sphinx's Revelation allows the player to draw additional cards and gain life, while cards like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame provide direct damage to close out the game. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggression and control."

The deck also includes burn spells like Searing Spear and Pillar of Flame to control the board and deal damage directly to the opponent. The mana base is streamlined to ensure the deck can consistently curve out and apply pressure."
