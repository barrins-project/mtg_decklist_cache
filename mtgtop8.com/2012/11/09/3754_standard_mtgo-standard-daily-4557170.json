The deck utilizes a variety of removal spells like Ultimate Price and Dreadbore to deal with threats, while also including powerful threats like Thundermaw Hellkite and Thragtusk to pressure opponents. The deck also includes mana ramp spells like Farseek to help cast its higher cost spells, and powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to disrupt opponents' hands. The deck aims to grind out the opponent through attrition and overwhelming them with powerful threats."
