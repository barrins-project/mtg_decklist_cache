By utilizing cards like Mark of Mutiny to steal opponent's creatures and sacrificing them for value with cards like Blood Artist and Bloodthrone Vampire, the deck aims to constantly pressure the opponent's life total. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Falkenrath Aristocrat and Hellrider to close out games quickly. The mana base of Blood Crypt, Cavern of Souls, and Dragonskull Summit ensures smooth mana curve and consistency."
