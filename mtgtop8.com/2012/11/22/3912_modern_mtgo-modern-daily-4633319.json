            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly building a strong board presence with low-cost creatures like Soul's Attendant, Soul Warden, and Serra Ascendant, while utilizing cards like Honor of the Pure to boost their power. The Martyr of Sands serves as a key piece by gaining life and allowing for the early activation of Serra Ascendant. Ranger of Eos helps to search for more creatures, while Aven Mindcensor disrupts opponents' searches. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy centered around gaining life and maintaining board presence."
