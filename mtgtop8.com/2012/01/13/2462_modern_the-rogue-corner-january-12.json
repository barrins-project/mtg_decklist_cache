Cards like Ethersworn Canonist help to control the opponent's spell casting, giving you time to build up your token army. Soul Warden helps gain life as you flood the board with creatures, and cards like Path to Exile and Oblivion Ring provide removal options. The deck includes a mix of token generators, buffs, and control elements to create a fast-paced and aggressive strategy focused on overwhelming the opponent with a horde of creatures."
