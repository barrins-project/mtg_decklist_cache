            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of low-cost creatures, maximizing the value of cards like Champion of the Parish, Doomed Traveler, and Mirran Crusader. By buffing these creatures with cards like Honor of the Pure and Angelic Destiny, as well as protecting them with cards like Grand Abolisher and Fiend Hunter, the deck can maintain a strong offense while preventing the opponent from effectively countering. The inclusion of Gideon's Lawkeeper and Oblivion Ring provide additional utility and control options, making this a versatile and aggressive deck."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on managing the opponent's threats and controlling the game through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and board wipes. It utilizes powerful finishers like Consecrated Sphinx, Elesh Norn, and Grave Titan to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been exhausted. The deck also includes card advantage engines like Think Twice and Forbidden Alchemy to maintain a full hand of options. By efficiently controlling the battlefield and card advantage, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and ultimately emerge victorious."
