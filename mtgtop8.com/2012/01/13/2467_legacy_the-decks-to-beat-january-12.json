It utilizes cards like Goblin Lackey and Aether Vial to cheat goblins into play, while also providing card advantage with Goblin Ringleader. The deck also includes removal in the form of Gempalm Incinerator and Tarfire to deal with opposing threats. The goal is to apply constant pressure and finish off the opponent before they can stabilize or mount a defense. The key strategy is to maintain board presence and maximize the efficiency of goblin synergies."
