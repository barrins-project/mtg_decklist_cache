By using lords like Lord of Atlantis and Merrow Reejerey to pump up the team, combined with disruption spells like Mana Leak and Spell Snare to control the opponent's plays, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. Mutavault and Coralhelm Commander provide additional flexibility and utility, while cards like Vendilion Clique and Cryptic Command offer both disruption and card advantage."
