The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive board presence, utilizing the synergies between artifacts and creature buffs to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The key strategy is to control the board with cards like Kitchen Finks and Melira, Sylvok Outcast, while also disrupting the opponent with cards like Tidehollow Sculler and Inquisition of Kozilek. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by recurring creatures like Eternal Witness and Reveillark, while also having the ability to generate infinite combos with cards like Murderous Redcap and Viscera Seer."
