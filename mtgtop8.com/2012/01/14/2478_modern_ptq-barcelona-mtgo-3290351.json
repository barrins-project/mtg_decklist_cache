            "notes": "The deck focuses on using efficient faeries and counterspells to control the game, while also utilizing the Twin Exarch combo as a win condition. By keeping the opponent's threats in check with countermagic and stealing their creatures with Vedalken Shackles, the deck can buy time to assemble the combo and win the game. Mistbind Clique and Scion of Oona provide additional disruption and pressure, while Mutavault and Faerie Conclave offer creature threats that can also close out games. The deck aims to outmaneuver opponents with quick and versatile plays."
