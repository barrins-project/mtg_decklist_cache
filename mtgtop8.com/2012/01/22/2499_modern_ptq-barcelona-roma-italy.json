The inclusion of Simian Spirit Guide allows for explosive starts and Lightning Bolt provides some removal or reach. The deck aims to win the game in one turn by chaining spells together efficiently."

By casting Pacts that your opponent cannot pay for, they will be unable to fulfill the pact's conditions and lose the game. The deck also includes some card draw and mana acceleration to help set up the combo quickly and efficiently. It focuses on creating a lock that is difficult for opponents to break out of, leading to a swift victory once the combo is established."
