The deck uses cards like Life from the Loam to consistently gain advantage by replaying lands from the graveyard, while also disrupting the opponent's mana base with cards like Wasteland. Additionally, cards like Raven's Crime and Pernicious Deed provide additional control options, allowing the player to manipulate the board state to their advantage. This deck aims to grind out the opponent by denying resources and overwhelming them with powerful land-based threats."
