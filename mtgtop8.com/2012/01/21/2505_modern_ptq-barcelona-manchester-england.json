The deck aims to control the game with countermagic and removal while dealing chip damage with evasive creatures like Vendilion Clique and Creeping Tar Pit. The inclusion of tempo cards like Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage allows for flexibility in game strategy. The Swords provide additional utility and resilience. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements while maximizing efficiency."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on playing cheap artifacts and creatures quickly to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy. Its key strength lies in the synergy between artifacts and creatures, using cards like Arcbound Ravager and Cranial Plating to boost creature power and deal massive damage. With a high number of zero-cost creatures like Ornithopter and Memnite, the deck can quickly deploy threats and close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The deck also has reach with burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Shrapnel Blast to finish off opponents."
