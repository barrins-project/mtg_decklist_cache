By disrupting the opponent's hand with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, and countering their spells with Mana Leak and Cryptic Command, the deck aims to clear the way for efficient beatdowns from creatures like Delver of Secrets and Vendilion Clique. The inclusion of Sword of Feast and Famine adds another threat and provides additional disruption with its abilities. Ultimately, this deck seeks to outmaneuver and overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive and disruptive strategy."
