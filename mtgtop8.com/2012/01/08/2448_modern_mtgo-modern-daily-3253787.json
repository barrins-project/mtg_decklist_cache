By using Birthing Pod and Chord of Calling, players can search for specific creatures to either disrupt their opponent's strategy or enhance their own. The inclusion of Melira, Sylvok Outcast and Kitchen Finks allows for infinite life gain combos, while cards like Eternal Witness and Reveillark provide recursion and value. The toolbox nature of the deck gives it versatility and adaptability in various matchups. The key strategy is to efficiently combo off while controlling the board."

By using cards such as Coralhelm Commander, Lord of Atlantis, and Merrow Reejerey to buff up and support the Merfolk creatures, as well as control spells like Mana Leak, Spell Pierce, and Vapor Snag to disrupt the opponent's game plan, this deck aims to establish early dominance and maintain pressure throughout the game. The inclusion of Mutavault provides additional versatility and resilience to the deck."
