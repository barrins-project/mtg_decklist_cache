By efficiently getting massive creatures like Sphinx of the Steel Wind and Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite onto the battlefield, the deck can overwhelm opponents with huge threats early in the game. The deck also includes disruption with cards like Force of Will and Thoughtseize to protect its game plan and control the opponent's resources."
