It also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Baleful Mastery to deal with opposing creatures. The deck aims to control the game until it can win with a powerful finisher like Shark Typhoon or creature lands like Hall of Storm Giants."

It aims to pressure the opponent early with creatures like Spawn of Mayhem, Rankle, Master of Pranks, and Knight of the Ebon Legion while disrupting their game plan with cards like Fatal Push and Thoughtseize. The deck also utilizes cards like Mutavault and Scrapheap Scrounger for additional threats and resilience. Castle Locthwain provides card advantage while Graveyard Trespasser and Murderous Rider offer flexibility in dealing with various threats. The deck's strategy revolves around maintaining relentless pressure and disrupting the opponent's game plan."
