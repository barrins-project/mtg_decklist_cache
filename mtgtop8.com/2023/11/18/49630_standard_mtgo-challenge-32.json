            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to maintain control over the game by disrupting the opponent's strategy and maximizing card advantage. It achieves this by utilizing cards like Negate, Make Disappear, Get Lost, and Consider to counter or remove threats from the opponent's side of the board. Additionally, it utilizes card draw effects like Sleight of Hand, Chart a Course, and Helping Hand to ensure a steady stream of resources. The win condition of this deck is to utilize creatures like Picklock Prankster, Monastery Mentor, and Haughty Djinn to establish a dominant board presence and quickly close out the game."
