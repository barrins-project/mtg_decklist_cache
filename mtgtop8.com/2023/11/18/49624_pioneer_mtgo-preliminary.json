This is achieved through various cards that allow for land manipulation and card draw, such as Sylvan Scrying and Pore Over the Pages. By assembling the Lotus Field along with other combo pieces like Discontinuity and Omniscience, the player can generate an overwhelming advantage in terms of resources and spells. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Dark Petition and Emergent Ultimatum to search for specific combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's strategy."

The deck also includes additional cards that can deal damage or disrupt the opponent, such as Lightning Axe, Spikefield Hazard, and Picklock Prankster. The inclusion of Treasure Cruise and Temporal Trespass helps the player maintain card advantage and potentially gain extra turns, further solidifying the deck's aggressive strategy."

The deck focuses on using spells like Impulse','','');\"&gt;<a href=\"#\">Fiery Impulse</a> and Spikefield Hazard to control the board and deal with any threats, while also utilizing card draw spells like Dig Through Time and Impulse to maintain resources.
