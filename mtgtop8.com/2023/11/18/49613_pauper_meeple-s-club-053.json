It includes counterspells like Spell Pierce, Force Spike, and Counterspell to disrupt the opponent's plans. Additionally, it features bounce spells like Boomerang to temporarily remove threats and Deep Analysis for additional card advantage. The deck utilizes Snow-Covered Islands to enable card interactions with Lórien Revealed."
