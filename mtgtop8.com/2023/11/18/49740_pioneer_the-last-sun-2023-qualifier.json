The deck features a mix of creatures that provide both offense and defense, such as Bonecrusher Giant and Pugnacious Hammerskull. It also includes cards like Esika's Chariot and The Huntsman's Redemption to generate additional creatures and maintain a strong board. Additionally, the deck utilizes mana acceleration through cards like Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves. The inclusion of Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion adds consistency and extra mana generation to the deck."
