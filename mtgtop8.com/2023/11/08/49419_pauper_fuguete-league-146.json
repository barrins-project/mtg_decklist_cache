The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of creatures that quickly become strong threats due to the various enchantments and equipment attached to them. The deck also includes protection spells to keep the creatures safe from removal or damage-based spells. With a heavy focus on early aggression and creature enhancement, the deck aims to quickly defeat the opponent before they can establish a strong defense."
