The deck aims to draw extra cards with Deep Analysis and Thought Scour, improving its card selection with Brainstorm and Ponder. It further disrupts the opponent's graveyard strategy with Crawl from the Cellar. The creatures Fallaji Archaeologist, Cryptic Serpent, and Tolarian Terror provide win conditions. The deck's mana base consists of Islands and lands that can tap for both black and blue mana."
