The deck achieves this by utilizing powerful Merfolk creatures like Lord of Atlantis, Master of the Pearl Trident, and True-Name Nemesis to quickly deal damage. The inclusion of cards like Brazen Borrower and Svyelun of Sea and Sky provide additional versatility and control options. The deck also incorporates disruptive elements such as Tide Shaper and Vodalian Hexcatcher to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base includes cards like Cavern of Souls, Mutavault, and Wasteland to ensure consistent and efficient mana production."
