The deck includes cards such as Bloodbraid Elf, Shardless Agent, and Fury to cascade into other spells and gain additional value. It also features control elements like Solitude, Teferi, Time Raveler, and Supreme Verdict to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to gradually gain advantage and outvalue the opponent while maintaining control of the board."
