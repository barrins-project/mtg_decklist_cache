It focuses on playing low-cost creatures that can attack early, such as Lunarch Veteran and Zephyr Sentinel, supported by cards like Resolute Reinforcements and Recruitment Officer to replenish the hand and maintain a steady stream of threats. The deck also utilizes some control elements with cards like Make Disappear and Fortified Beachhead to disrupt the opponent's strategy. It aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and maintain advantage throughout the game."
