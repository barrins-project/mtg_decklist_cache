The deck focuses on disruption and control, utilizing cards like Sudden Edict and Chalice of the Void to disrupt the opponent's game plan. It also has a strong late-game presence with powerful creatures like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Archfiend of the Dross. The deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total and control the board through a combination of aggression and disruption."

It uses cards like Chrome Mox, Lion's Eye Diamond, and Lotus Petal to generate fast mana, while Brainstorm and Ponder help with card selection and digging for key pieces. The deck also utilizes cards like Cabal Ritual and Dark Ritual to generate even more mana. The key combo pieces are Ad Nauseam and Gaea's Will, which allow the player to draw and play a significant portion of their deck in one turn, culminating in a powerful Tendrils of Agony for lethal damage."

The deck aims to deal consistent damage through burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Price of Progress, while also utilizing card manipulation tools like Brainstorm and Ponder to ensure consistent draws. The inclusion of Mishra's Bauble helps generate card advantage and provide additional information about the opponent's deck. The deck also has some land disruption with Wasteland to hinder the opponent's mana development."

The deck also utilizes disruptive spells like Force of Will and Daze to protect its board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck includes efficient removal spells like Unholy Heat and Lightning Bolt to clear the way for its creatures. The deck's mana base consists of fetchlands and dual lands to ensure consistent access to all necessary colors of mana. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure, disrupt the opponent's strategy, and maintain a strong board presence."
