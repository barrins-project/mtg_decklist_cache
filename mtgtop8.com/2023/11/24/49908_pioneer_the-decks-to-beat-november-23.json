The deck focuses on early aggression, utilizing cards like Knight-Errant of Eos, Thraben Inspector, and Ornithopter to establish a strong board presence. Additionally, Thalia, Guardian of Thraben disrupts the opponent's spells, while Venerated Loxodon and Warden of the Inner Sky provide anthem effects to boost the power and toughness of the entire team. The inclusion of Gleeful Demolition allows for targeted permanent removal, further cementing the deck's aggressive strategy."

            "notes": "The key concept of this UW Control deck in Pioneer 1 vs 1 format is to establish control of the game by utilizing counterspells, removal, and card advantage. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Dovin's Veto and Temporary Lockdown, while also having card filtering options with Dig Through Time and Castle Vantress. The deck also has a win condition through March of Otherworldly Light and Shark Typhoon. Overall, the deck focuses on slowing down the opponent, denying their resources, and closing out the game with efficient threats."
