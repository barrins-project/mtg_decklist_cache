The main win condition is to assemble the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Mine, Urza's Power Plant, and Urza's Tower) to generate a large amount of mana. This mana is then used to cast powerful threats such as Karn Liberated, Karn, the Great Creator, and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The deck also utilizes control elements like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus to manage the opponent's graveyard and board state, while also using search cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to ensure consistency."

Teferi, Time Raveler provides additional control and disruption, while Up the Beanstalk accelerates mana for explosive plays. The deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent through the efficient use of Cascade."
