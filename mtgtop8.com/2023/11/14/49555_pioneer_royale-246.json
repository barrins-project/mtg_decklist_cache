This is achieved by combining early mana acceleration with strong threats like Bonecrusher Giant and Reckless Stormseeker. The inclusion of companions adds additional flexibility and consistency to the deck. The deck also features some removal spells like Obliterating Bolt and The Akroan War to control the opponent's board. Overall, the deck aims to dominate the board early on and deal significant damage to the opponent before they can stabilize or mount a successful defense."

The deck uses low-cost creatures like Ornithopter, Thraben Inspector, Voldaren Epicure, and Resolute Reinforcements to quickly flood the battlefield. Cards like Regal Bunnicorn, Giant Killer, Knight-Errant of Eos, and Venerated Loxodon provide additional utility and power. The deck also includes disruption with Gleeful Demolition and resilient lands with Legion's Landing and Den of the Bugbear. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the aggressive gameplan with efficient lands like Battlefield Forge, Sacred Foundry, Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire, Shefet Dunes, Needleverge Pathway, Mountain, and Plains."
