The deck aims to quickly deal damage to the opponent by utilizing cheap and efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Voldaren Epicure, along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast. The deck also utilizes artifact cards like Implement of Combustion and Experimental Synthesizer to trigger additional damage or provide card advantage. The key strategy is to keep the pressure on the opponent and finish the game before they have a chance to stabilize."

By utilizing cards like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement, the deck aims to generate a large amount of mana. This mana is then used to cast impactful spells, such as Freed from the Real, which can be attached to a wall and untap it repeatedly. This allows for infinite mana and potentially infinite casts of spells. The deck also includes support cards like Quirion Ranger and Saruli Caretaker to help with the combo. Additionally, Lead the Stampede and Winding Way ensure the deck can consistently find the necessary pieces for the combo."
