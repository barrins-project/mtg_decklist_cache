The deck includes low-cost creatures like Delver of Secrets and Dragon's Rage Channeler, which can quickly apply pressure to opponents. It also utilizes disruption and removal spells like Brainstorm, Daze, and Force of Will to counter and control the opponent's plays. The deck aims to control the board early on and deal consistent damage with efficient spells like Lightning Bolt. The mana base is constructed to provide the necessary colors while utilizing Wasteland for land destruction."
