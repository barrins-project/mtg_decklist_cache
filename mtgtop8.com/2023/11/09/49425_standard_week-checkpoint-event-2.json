Cards like Knockout Blow, Fading Hope, and Make Disappear provide targeted removal options, while Temporary Lockdown and Soul Partition lock down the opponent's board and limit their options. Urza's Rebuff and Sunfall offer counterspell protection. The deck also has card draw and filtering options with Jace, the Perfected Mind and Memory Deluge. The land base includes lands like Field of Ruin and Adarkar Wastes to also disrupt the opponent's mana."
