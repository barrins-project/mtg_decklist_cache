This is supported by a strong burn package of Lightning Bolt, Lava Dart, Chain Lightning, and Skewer the Critics to deal direct damage. The deck also utilizes cards like End the Festivities and Wrenn's Resolve to control the board and protect its creatures. The goal is to maintain a fast and relentless assault, utilizing cards like Reckless Impulse to constantly replenish the hand and keep up the pressure. The Autonomous Furnace provides additional damage and the mana base consists of 17 Mountains to ensure consistent aggression."

By flickering these creatures, you can gain life, return instants and sorceries from your graveyard to your hand, and draw cards. This deck also includes various control elements like Counterspell and Snap to protect your combo and disrupt your opponent. The deck includes card draw and manipulation spells like Ponder and Preordain to help find your combo pieces. Additionally, it utilizes lands like Azorius Chancery to generate additional value."
