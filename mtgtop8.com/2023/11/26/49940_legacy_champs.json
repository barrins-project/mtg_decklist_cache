Chalice of the Void acts as a disruptive element, preventing opponents from casting low-cost spells. Ancient Tomb, Cavern of Souls, and City of Traitors provide extra mana sources. Karakas offers a powerful utility effect. Lastly, it includes a small splash of red for access to Touch the Spirit Realm and a basic Mountain for flexibility."

The key concept revolves around using cards like Pithing Needle and The One Ring to shut down opponent's key cards or abilities. It utilizes a mixture of mana acceleration, such as Mox Opal and Lotus Petal, and artifact manipulation, such as Sculpting Steel and Manifold Key. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Tangle Wire and Sphere of Resistance to slow down the opponent's game plan. The land base supports the artifact theme with cards like Urza's Saga and Ancient Tomb."

It utilizes creatures like Knight of the Reliquary, Gaddock Teeg, and Questing Beast to dominate the battlefield and deal damage. The deck also includes disruptive elements such as Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Plague Engineer to hinder the opponent's strategies. Additionally, it has a strong mana base with powerful lands like Gaea's Cradle and Karakas to support its aggressive gameplay. Overall, the deck aims to outpace and overpower the opponent through efficient creature-based aggression."
