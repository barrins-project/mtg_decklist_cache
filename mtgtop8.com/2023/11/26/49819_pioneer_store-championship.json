It also aims to control the board with targeted removal like Fatal Push and Go for the Throat. The deck's win condition is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures like Reckoner Bankbuster, Sheoldred, the Apocalypse, Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger, Graveyard Trespasser, and Bloodtithe Harvester. The synergy between these cards and their ability to control the game flow through disruption and aggression make this deck a force to be reckoned with in Pioneer 1 vs 1."

The key concept of this deck is to rapidly overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient creatures and disruptive spells. Playing cards like Collected Company, Supreme Phantom, and Spell Queller allow the deck to quickly flood the board with powerful Spirits while also countering the opponent's spells. The inclusion of Mausoleum Wanderer and Rattlechains provide additional disruption, making it difficult for the opponent to effectively deal with the aggressive onslaught. Overall, the key concept is to use Spirits to apply early pressure and maintain control of the game."
