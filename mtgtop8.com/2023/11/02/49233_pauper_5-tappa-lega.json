By utilizing ramp spells like Wild Growth, Utopia Sprawl, and Llanowar Visionary, the deck aims to quickly deploy powerful creatures such as Avenging Hunter, Boarding Party, and Annoyed Altisaur. This is supported by removal spells like Skred and Thermokarst to clear the way for attacks. The inclusion of Mwonvuli Acid-Moss disrupts the opponent's mana base, providing an advantage for the aggro strategy. Sarulf's Packmate and Generous Ent provide card draw to maintain the deck's aggression."
