By including cards such as Llanowar Elves, Elvish Mystic, and Wolfwillow Haven, the deck aims to ramp up mana quickly, allowing for the activation of Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx. This Devotion then enables powerful cards like Old-Growth Troll and Cavalier of Thorns to dominate the battlefield. Additionally, the deck incorporates cards like Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner and Karn, the Great Creator to provide card draw and additional utility. Overall, the deck focuses on maximizing Green Devotion to overwhelm opponents."
