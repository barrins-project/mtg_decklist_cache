It utilizes a mix of removal spells like Snuff Out and Fatal Push, along with hand disruption through Thoughtseize. The deck also aims to bring back powerful creatures from the graveyard with cards like Reanimate and Grist, the Hunger Tide. It includes efficient beaters like Tarmogoyf and Orcish Bowmasters to apply consistent pressure, with support from Minsc &amp; Boo, Timeless Heroes and Troll of Khazad-d√ªm. The mana base consists of fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistent access to multiple colors."
