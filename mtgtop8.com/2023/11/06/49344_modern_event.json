It focuses on using creatures with haste, such as Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt, to quickly reduce the opponent's life total. The deck also includes cards like Skullcrack and Boros Charm to prevent the opponent from gaining life or stabilizing the board. It utilizes land destruction spells like Searing Blaze to control the opponent's creatures while dealing damage. The inclusion of cards like Roiling Vortex and Sunbaked Canyon ensure a continuous source of damage throughout the game."
