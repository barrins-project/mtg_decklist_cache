The deck focuses on playing low-cost creatures like Dennick, Pious Apprentice and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to quickly overwhelm the opponent. It also includes control elements like Go for the Throat to deal with opposing threats. The deck includes a mix of different land types to ensure consistent mana base, allowing for smooth gameplay. The inclusion of Lord Skitter, Sewer King and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse suggests a slight focus on graveyard recursion to maintain a strong board presence."

Supporting this strategy are cards like Glissa Sunslayer, Blossoming Tortoise, and Mosswood Dreadknight to provide a strong board presence. Removal spells like Go for the Throat and Cut Down help deal with opposing threats, while Duress can disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes a couple of planeswalkers, Liliana of the Veil and Nissa, Ascended Animist, to provide additional value and utility. The land base consists of a mix of swamps, forests, and dual lands to ensure consistent mana production."
