By utilizing cards like Elvish Spirit Guide and Land Grant, the deck aims to generate mana quickly and search for specific combo pieces like Laboratory Maniac or Autochthon Wurm. The deck also includes protection spells like Veil of Summer and Pact of Negation to ensure the combo goes off successfully. Additionally, the inclusion of Chancellor of the Tangle and Carpet of Flowers adds extra mana acceleration and ramp."
