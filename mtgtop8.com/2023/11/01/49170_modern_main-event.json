Additionally, the deck includes spells like Thoughtseize, Grief, and Dauthi Voidwalker to disrupt the opponent's hand and graveyard, disrupting their strategy. The inclusion of Feign Death and Not Dead After All adds resilience and the ability to recur creatures from the graveyard."

The deck also has access to versatile cards like Cryptic Command and Archmage's Charm to adapt to different situations. It aims to keep the opponent on the back foot and gradually take control of the game until it reaches a winning position."
