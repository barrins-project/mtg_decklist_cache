The main strategy involves playing low-cost creatures like Jukai Naturalist and Weaver of Harmony to quickly develop a strong board presence. The deck also focuses on generating card advantage with cards like Spirited Companion and Generous Visitor. Michiko's Reign of Truth helps control the opponent's hand size and disrupt their strategy. The inclusion of removal spells like Seal from Existence and Ossification helps deal with threats on the opponent's side of the field. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive creatures and efficient card advantage."

The key strategy is to efficiently deploy cheap creatures like Spellbook Vendor, Recruitment Officer, and Hopeful Initiate to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Adeline, Resplendent Cathar help to disrupt the opponent's plans and slow them down. Cards like Ossification and Fateful Absence provide removal options, while the inclusion of Mishra's Foundry and Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire offer additional utility. Overall, the deck aims to maintain a strong board presence and outpace the opponent through aggressive plays."
