This loop is achieved by using cards such as Shield Sphere, Axebane Guardian, and Overgrown Battlement to generate large amounts of mana, which can then be used with Freed from the Real to untap the creatures and repeat the process. This allows the player to generate an infinite amount of mana, which can be used to cast powerful spells or activate abilities for a game-winning combo."
