The deck includes cards like Ghostly Flicker, Archaeomancer, and Mulldrifter, which allow you to repeatedly bounce and replay powerful creatures and spells. This enables you to draw additional cards, counter opposing spells, and create a strong board presence. The deck also includes cards like Sunscape Familiar and God-Pharaoh's Faithful to reduce mana costs and gain life, respectively. By utilizing the flicker mechanic effectively, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with card advantage and controlling plays."
