The deck heavily relies on faeries and ninjas, which not only offer efficient bodies but also incentivize card draw and disruption. By combining efficient threats with countermagic and bounce effects, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with tempo advantage, quickly depleting their life total. The deck's strength lies in its ability to maintain a steady flow of threats while suppressing the opponent's game plan through disruption and tempo manipulation."
