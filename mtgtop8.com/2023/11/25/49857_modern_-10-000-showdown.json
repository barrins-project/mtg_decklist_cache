The deck aims to keep the opponent's threats in check with cards like Spell Pierce and Prismatic Ending while also generating card advantage with Wrenn and Six and Teferi, Time Raveler. The deck utilizes its mana efficiently with ramp spells like Up the Beanstalk and Leyline Binding to play powerful threats such as Omnath, Locus of Creation and Solitude. Additionally, the deck has a land toolbox with cards like Endurance and can fetch specific lands with Flooded Strand and Misty Rainforest."

The inclusion of Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and Not Dead After All provides additional threats and resilience. Removal spells like Terminate and Lightning Bolt help clear the way for attackers, while Undying Evil and Molten Collapse offer surprise combat tricks.

This allows the player to control the board while dealing damage with creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Orcish Bowmasters. Additionally, the deck has removal spells like Terminate and Lightning Bolt to deal with threats quickly. The mana base is designed to provide the necessary colors for casting spells efficiently."
