It utilizes low-cost creatures such as Young Wolf and Skarrgan Pit-Skulk to quickly establish board presence and apply pressure. Cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Mutagenic Growth allow for explosive starts and increased creature power. The deck also includes removal spells like Ram Through and Vines of Vastwood for additional versatility and to remove potential blockers. With an emphasis on speed and efficiency, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
