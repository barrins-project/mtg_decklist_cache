The deck achieves this by combining aggressive, low-cost creatures like Ledger Shredder and Picklock Prankster with efficient removal spells such as Lightning Axe and Fiery Impulse. The deck also includes card draw spells like Opt and Consider, along with Treasure Cruise, to maintain a consistent flow of cards and fuel the Phoenix's recursion ability. The inclusion of counterspells like Spell Pierce and disruptive lands like Jwari Disruption adds some control elements to protect the game plan."
