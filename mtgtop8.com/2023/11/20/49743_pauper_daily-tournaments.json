This allows the player to quickly build a strong board presence with powerful creatures like Timberwatch Elf and Elvish Vanguard. Additionally, the deck includes card draw and creature search effects like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way to maintain card advantage and find key pieces for the strategy."

The deck also takes advantage of cards like Militia Bugler and Raffine's Informant to draw additional cards and maintain card advantage. Prismatic Strands provides protection for your creatures, while Guardians' Pledge buffs your entire team. The deck has a strong token theme with cards like Battle Screech, which helps to flood the board with creatures. Finally, the deck includes removal spells like Journey to Nowhere to deal with opposing threats."
