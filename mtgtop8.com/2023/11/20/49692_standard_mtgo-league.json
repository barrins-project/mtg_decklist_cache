The deck focuses on using efficient and powerful cards like Deathcap Glade, Glissa Sunslayer, and Mosswood Dreadknight to put pressure on the opponent. It also includes disruption elements like Duress and Go for the Throat to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Liliana of the Veil provides card advantage and interaction, while cards like Nissa, Ascended Animist and Virtue of Persistence offer additional value and resilience. Overall, the deck aims to apply relentless pressure and maintain board control to emerge victorious."
