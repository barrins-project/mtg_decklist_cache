The deck focuses on using cards like Crop Rotation, Exploration, and Life from the Loam to search for and play powerful lands like Dark Depths and Urza's Saga. These lands provide various advantages, such as creating powerful creatures or generating additional resources. Additionally, the deck includes removal spells like Punishing Fire to deal with threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The goal is to establish a strong board presence and maintain control of the game by leveraging the power of lands."
