The deck focuses on quickly building a board presence and utilizing cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Adeline, Resplendent Cathar to boost the power of its creatures. It also includes a few protection spells like Brave the Elements to keep its creatures alive against removal. The inclusion of Mutavault, Shefet Dunes, and Castle Ardenvale provide additional utility and ways to pump up the team. Overall, the deck aims to maintain aggression and pressure throughout the game."
