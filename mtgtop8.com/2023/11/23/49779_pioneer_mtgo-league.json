Thieves' Guild Enforcer and Soaring Thought-Thief are the main creatures that benefit from the mill and card-discard effects, while Nighthawk Scavenger provides a strong flying threat. The deck also includes some utility lands like Castle Locthwain and Agadeem's Awakening to maximize its resources.
