The deck aims for early game advantage by utilizing efficient card draw spells like Brainstorm, Consider, Thought Scour, and Ponder to maintain a consistent flow of threats and answers. The deck combines disruption and protection with Counterspell, Snap, and Spell Pierce to control the opponent's actions, while also utilizing LÃ³rien Revealed and Deep Analysis for additional card advantage. The deck relies heavily on the Island to cast its spells and maintain the necessary mana."
