The deck uses lands like Simic Growth Chamber and Thriving Isle to ramp up its mana production and ensure consistent card draw. Overall, the deck focuses on control and combo strategies to outlast and defeat the opponent."

It aims to quickly establish a strong board presence with cards like Goliath Paladin and Troll of Khazad-dûm while disrupting the opponent's strategy with removal spells like Snuff Out and Cast Down. The deck also includes value cards like Ephemerate and Hopeless Nightmare to provide card advantage and powerful effects. It utilizes a mix of basic lands and dual lands to ensure consistent mana access for its spells."
