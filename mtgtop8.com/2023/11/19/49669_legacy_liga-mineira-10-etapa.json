The deck utilizes various mana acceleration cards such as Lotus Petal and Chrome Mox to ramp up its resources early on. It also includes key goblin creatures like Goblin Chieftain, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Muxus, Goblin Grandee to boost the power and effectiveness of the goblin army. The inclusion of cards like Battle Cry Goblin and the unidentified \"______ Goblin\" suggest that the deck focuses on maximizing the damage output and the synergies between goblin creatures. The land base consisting of Ancient Tomb, City of Traitors, and Cavern of Souls further aid in mana production and ensuring the early deployment of goblin hordes."
