The deck aims to stall and disrupt the opponent's plans through cards like Counterspell and Journey to Nowhere. It also incorporates creatures like Sacred Cat and Squadron Hawk to provide board presence and defense. The Gate cards, such as Citadel Gate and Azorius Guildgate, are used to enhance the deck's synergy and enable strategic mana usage. The deck relies on smart card selection and careful planning to outlast and outplay the opponent."

The deck focuses on low-cost creatures and efficient card draw to maintain a steady stream of threats. It also includes a mix of removal spells and combat tricks to control the board. The inclusion of equipment enhances the power of the creatures, making them more difficult to deal with. The deck is built around the synergy of white weenie creatures and spells, creating a cohesive game plan that aims to quickly and efficiently defeat the opponent."
