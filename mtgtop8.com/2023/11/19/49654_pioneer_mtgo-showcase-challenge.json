The key concept is to use low-cost spells like Sleight of Hand, Lightning Axe, Fiery Impulse, and Opt to fuel graveyard recursion and enable the constant revival of Arclight Phoenix. The deck also focuses on card draw and finding the necessary spells to cast with Pieces of the Puzzle and Consider. It utilizes a mix of counterplay with Jwari Disruption and Prismari Command, along with the potential for big turns with Temporal Trespass and Galvanic Iteration. The inclusion of Hall of Storm Giants and Otawara, Soaring City provides additional utility and options for the deck."

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of cheap creatures, such as Thraben Inspector and Ornithopter, and powerful buffs like Venerated Loxodon. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben disrupts the opponent's spells, while Giant Killer provides removal. Resolute Reinforcements and Knight-Errant of Eos support the aggressive strategy by generating additional creatures. The deck also includes some utility lands like Shefet Dunes and Den of the Bugbear. Overall, the focus is on generating a strong board presence and applying continuous pressure."
