By cycling cards like Street Wraith and Architects of Will, the deck can quickly set up for a Living End, which brings all the creatures back onto the battlefield. The deck also utilizes cards like Grief and Force of Negation to disrupt opponent's strategies while setting up its own combo. With cards like Waker of Waves and Curator of Mysteries, the deck can also generate card advantage and maintain control of the game."
