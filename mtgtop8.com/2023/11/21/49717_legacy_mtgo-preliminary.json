It utilizes Thought Scour and Ponder to filter through the deck and find necessary cards. The deck's threats, Questing Druid, Murktide Regent, and Dragon's Rage Channeler, are resilient and can quickly close out the game. The land base is built to provide the necessary colors and support for the strategy, including Wasteland for additional disruption."

It utilizes cheap and efficient spells like Lightning Bolt and Daze to control the game early on and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck relies on strong cantrips such as Brainstorm and Ponder to find key cards and maintain card advantage. It also has powerful threats like Delver of Secrets, Dragon's Rage Channeler, and Murktide Regent to quickly close out the game. The deck utilizes a mix of fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistent mana production. It also utilizes Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's mana base."
