The deck also focuses on card advantage and card selection with Impulse and Memory Deluge. Teferi, Hero of Dominaria provides additional control and card advantage. The deck includes a few win conditions with Shark Typhoon and The Wandering Emperor, and also has some land utility with Castle Vantress and Hall of Storm Giants. The mana base consists of a mix of dual lands and utility lands."
