The inclusion of Indoctrination Attendant and Okiba-Gang Shinobi allows for additional disruption and card advantage. Additionally, Inspiring Overseer and Glint Hawk provide a strong offensive presence, while cards like Omen of the Dead and Thraben Inspector offer flexibility and card selection. The mana base is built to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent mana development."

This mana is then used to play multiple Elves per turn, allowing the player to quickly develop a strong board presence. The deck also includes cards like Timberwatch Elf and Elvish Vanguard, which can pump up the power and toughness of the entire Elf army, making them even more formidable. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and overrun the opponent with a flood of Elves."
