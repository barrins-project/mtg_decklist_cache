The deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Narset, Parter of Veils to generate card advantage and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck takes advantage of its companion, Yorion, Sky Nomad, to create value by flickering permanents with ETB effects. It also includes various utility lands (Castle Ardenvale, Castle Vantress, Field of Ruin) to provide additional options and disruption. Overall, the deck aims to maintain control of the game and outvalue the opponent."
