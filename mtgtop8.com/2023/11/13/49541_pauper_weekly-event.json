The deck includes cards like Glistener Elf and Blighted Agent that have infect, a mechanic that deals damage in the form of -1/-1 counters. This enables the player to quickly deplete the opponent's life total. The deck also includes pump spells like Mutagenic Growth and Vines of Vastwood to increase the power and toughness of creatures, making them even more threatening. The deck also includes a small number of lands to ensure a quick start."
