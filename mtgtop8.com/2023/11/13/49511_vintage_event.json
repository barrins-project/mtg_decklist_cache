            "notes": "This deck is built around the concept of utilizing aggressive creatures, known as Hatebears, to disrupt the opponent's strategy while applying pressure. The deck runs cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Archon of Emeria to slow down the opponent's spells, while also utilizing cards like Brutal Cathar and Cathar Commando to provide efficient threats. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Magus of the Moon to punish opponents who rely heavily on non-basic lands. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive game plan while also including some utility lands for disruption, such as Strip Mine and Wasteland."
