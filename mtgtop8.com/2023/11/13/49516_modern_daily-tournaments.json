The key idea is to quickly apply pressure on the opponent through a combination of creatures and spells that disrupt their game plan. Key cards like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger, Dauthi Voidwalker, Grief, and Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer are used to disrupt the opponent's hand or board state while dealing damage. The deck also includes removal spells like Terminate and Lightning Bolt to handle threats and keep the opponent on the back foot. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy with a mix of lands that produce black and red mana efficiently."
