This is accomplished through cards like Hedron Crab and Archive Trap to mill the opponent's library, Surgical Extraction to remove key cards from the opponent's graveyard, and Fractured Sanity and Tasha's Hideous Laughter to mill the opponent even further. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Drown in the Loch and Fatal Push to control the opponent's board and protect itself."
