The key concept is to generate value and card advantage through artifact synergies. The deck aims to flood the battlefield with artifact creatures like Sai, Master Thopterist and Emry, Lurker of the Loch and use their abilities to generate more creatures. The deck also uses powerful artifacts like Mishra's Bauble, Chalice of the Void, and Urza's Saga to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck focuses on quickly building a strong board presence and overwhelming the opponent."

This combo involves using cards like Nomads en-Kor and Cephalid Illusionist to mill the entire library and bring out Narcomoebas from the graveyard. Using Dread Return, the deck can then bring out Thassa's Oracle to win the game. The deck also includes disruption and protection elements like Force of Will and Cabal Therapy to counter opponents' strategies. The inclusion of Aether Vial helps with mana efficiency and the deck's consistency. Overall, the key concept is to quickly and efficiently assemble the combo pieces and win the game."
