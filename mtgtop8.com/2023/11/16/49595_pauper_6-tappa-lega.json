The deck focuses on accelerating mana with cards like Arbor Elf, Utopia Sprawl, and Wild Growth, allowing for faster plays. It also includes powerful creatures like Annoyed Altisaur, Avenging Hunter, and Generous Ent to deal damage quickly. The deck also has some removal spells like Skred and Mwonvuli Acid-Moss to control the opponent's game plan. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient aggressive playstyle."
