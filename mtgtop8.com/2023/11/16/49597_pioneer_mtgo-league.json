The main strategy revolves around quickly deploying low-cost creatures like Rattlechains, Mausoleum Wanderer, and Supreme Phantom to put pressure on the opponent. These spirits are complemented by powerful enchantments like Curious Obsession and Ascendant Spirit, which provide card draw and additional strength. The inclusion of cards like Shacklegeist and Brazen Borrower offers disruption and removal options. The deck also utilizes the snow-themed card Faceless Haven for additional creature power and utility. Lastly, a few counterspells like Spell Pierce provide some control elements."

By using Transmogrify, the deck aims to transform its own creatures into powerful threats such as Esika's Chariot or Fable of the Mirror-Breaker. The deck also includes various pathways and lands to ensure smooth mana production. Additional cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push help with disruption and removal, while Atraxa, Grand Unifier and Volcanic Spite offer alternate win conditions. Overall, the key idea is to use Transmogrify and Lukka's abilities to transform creatures into game-winning threats."

The deck also includes cards like Dreadhorde Arcanist and Tenth District Legionnaire to provide additional threats. The land cards and cards like Sejiri Shelter and Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance provide additional utility and protection. The goal of the deck is to create a fast and resilient board presence to overwhelm opponents and deal damage quickly."
