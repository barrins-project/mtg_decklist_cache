Utilizing mana acceleration from cards like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic allows for explosive starts and the ability to drop game-changing threats like Embercleave and Skysovereign, Consul Flagship. The deck also includes utility lands like Mutavault and Lair of the Hydra to provide additional versatility and reach. By combining aggressive creatures with powerful equipment and vehicles, this deck aims to apply relentless pressure and dominate the battlefield."

It aims to flood the board with cheap creatures like Hopeful Initiate and Adeline, Resplendent Cathar, supported by cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Luminarch Aspirant to boost their power. Brave the Elements provides protection and evasion, while Castle Ardenvale and Mutavault offer additional creature production. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Knight-Errant of Eos provide disruption and card advantage, making it difficult for opponents to stabilize."
