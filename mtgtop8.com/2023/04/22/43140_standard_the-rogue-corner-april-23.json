It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering key spells and removing threats from the board. Teferi, Temporal Pilgrim provides additional card advantage and control options. The deck also includes a mix of bounce spells and counterspells to further assert control over the battlefield. This mono blue control deck relies on careful decision-making and timing to outmaneuver opponents and secure victory."
