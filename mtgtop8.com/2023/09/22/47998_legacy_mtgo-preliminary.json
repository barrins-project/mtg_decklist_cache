The deck focuses on playing low-cost goblin creatures, such as Goblin Lackey, Mogg War Marshal, and Battle Cry Goblin, to quickly build a strong board presence. Cards like Goblin Warchief and Rundvelt Hordemaster provide additional benefits and make the goblins more powerful. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Chrome Mox to accelerate the mana and allow for explosive turns. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with an army of goblins and deal significant damage early in the game."
