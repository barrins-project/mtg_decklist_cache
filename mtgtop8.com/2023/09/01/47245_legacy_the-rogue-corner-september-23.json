The inclusion of Thassa's Oracle and Paradigm Shift allows the deck to potentially win the game by exiling its own library. Tempo and disruption are the primary strategies, with the combo serving as a backup win condition."

It also has various cards for tempo and disruption (Submerge, Daze, Vanishment) to maintain control of the board.

The deck includes cards like Brainstorm and Veil of Summer to provide card advantage and protection, and Burning Wish to search for key combo pieces or answers. The main win condition of the deck is to cast Mind's Desire, allowing the player to potentially play multiple spells from their deck and generate a powerful combo."
