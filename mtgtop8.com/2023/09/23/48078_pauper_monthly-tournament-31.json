The deck aims to slow down the opponent and disrupt their game plan by countering their spells and removing their threats. Additionally, the deck utilizes the Gates mechanic to gain value and generate card advantage. The deck also has a reanimation strategy with Dread Return and Lotleth Giant, allowing it to bring back powerful creatures from the graveyard to further its control and disruption. Overall, the key concept is to control the game and outlast the opponent's resources."
