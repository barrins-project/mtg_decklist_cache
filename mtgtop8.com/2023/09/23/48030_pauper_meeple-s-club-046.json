            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent quickly with small, low-cost white creatures known as \"weenies\". These weenies are supported by various spells, such as Guardians' Pledge and Recommission, to boost their power and protect them from removal spells. The deck also includes cards like Journey to Nowhere and Prismatic Strands to control the opponent's board and buy time for the weenies to deal damage. The deck aims to maintain a steady flow of creatures and use them to chip away at the opponent's life total until victory is achieved."
