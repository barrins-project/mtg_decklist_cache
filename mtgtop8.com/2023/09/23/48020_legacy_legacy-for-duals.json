            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to use the combo of Painter's Servant and Grindstone to mill out the opponent's entire deck in a single turn. This is accomplished by using cards like Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer to repeatedly tutor and play these combo pieces. The deck also utilizes disruptive elements like Pyroblast and Red Elemental Blast to protect the combo and prevent the opponent from interfering. Additionally, it includes cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Lotus Petal to generate extra mana for explosive plays. Overall, the deck aims to quickly assemble and execute the Painter-Grindstone combo to win the game."
