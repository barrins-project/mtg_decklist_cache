The deck achieves this by including low-cost, efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to eliminate threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also incorporates hand disruption cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize to further disrupt the opponent's strategies. Additionally, the deck includes powerful creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Dreadhorde Arcanist to deal consistent damage and generate card advantage."
