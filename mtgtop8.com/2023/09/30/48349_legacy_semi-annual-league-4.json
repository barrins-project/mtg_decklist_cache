It also heavily relies on discard spells like Cabal Therapy, Thoughtseize, and Duress to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The goal is to quickly assemble a combination of cards that allow the player to cast a powerful spell like Tendrils of Agony, which deals damage to the opponent based on the number of spells played that turn. The deck utilizes cards like Ad Nauseam and Infernal Tutor to search for and find the necessary pieces for the combo."

This is followed by casting Thassa's Oracle or activating Teferi, Time Raveler's -3 ability to win the game by having no cards in the library. The deck also includes control elements like Force of Will and Teferi to protect the combo."

It utilizes powerful counterspells like Force of Will and Force of Negation to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes card selection tools like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Narset, Parter of Veils to ensure consistency. Removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Prismatic Ending deal with troublesome creatures and threats. The deck's win condition is to outvalue the opponent by generating card advantage with Teferi, Time Raveler and Snapcaster Mage, while also utilizing Urza's Saga to create powerful artifact tokens."
