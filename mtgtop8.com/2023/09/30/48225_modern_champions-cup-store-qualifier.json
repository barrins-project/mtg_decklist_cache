It aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total while also disrupting their game plan through hand disruption and graveyard interaction. The deck combines strong early-game threats like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Grief with disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Dauthi Voidwalker to disrupt the opponent's hand and deny them resources. Additionally, the deck includes removal spells like Terminate and Lightning Bolt to deal with problematic creatures and ensure the opponent's board remains under control."
