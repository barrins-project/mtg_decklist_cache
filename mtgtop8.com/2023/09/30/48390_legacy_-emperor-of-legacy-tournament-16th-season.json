The deck also focuses on aggressive creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster, Bonecrusher Giant, and Laelia, the Blade Reforged to apply pressure and close out the game quickly. It utilizes acceleration with cards such as Simian Spirit Guide and Chrome Mox, while also having removal options with cards like Fury, Dead / Gone, and Shatterskull Smashing. The deck is supported by a land base consisting of Mountains, City of Traitors, Ancient Tomb, and Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance."
