The deck utilizes low-cost creatures like Yotian Frontliner and Knight-Errant of Eos to establish an early board presence, while also having access to removal spells like Gleeful Demolition and Monstrous Rage to deal with opposing threats. Resolute Reinforcements provides a powerful mid-game boost, while cards like Stoke the Flames and Regal Bunnicorn offer additional burn damage to finish off the opponent. The deck's mana base includes a mix of Plains, Mountains, and dual lands to ensure consistent and smooth mana flow."

Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Adeline, Resplendent Cathar provide additional benefits for having a high creature count, while Surge of Salvation and Ossification offer ways to boost the power and resilience of the creatures. The deck also includes a few disruptive elements, such as Intrepid Adversary and Steel Seraph, to further disrupt the opponent's strategy. The overall goal is to establish early board presence and maintain pressure throughout the game."

This is achieved through a combination of counterspells like Syncopate, Negate, and Dissipate, and removal spells like Make Disappear and March of Otherworldly Light. Teferi, Temporal Pilgrim provides additional control and card advantage, while Memory Deluge allows for efficient card draw and selection. The deck also includes a few utility lands like Blast Zone and Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire for added flexibility."
