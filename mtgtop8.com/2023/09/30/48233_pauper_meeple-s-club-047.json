The deck focuses on playing efficient creatures like Delver of Secrets, Cryptic Serpent, and Tolarian Terror, supplemented by a suite of instants and sorceries to control the game. This includes countermagic in the form of Force Spike, Spell Pierce, and Counterspell, as well as card draw and manipulation with Brainstorm, Thought Scour, Consider, and Deep Analysis. LÃ³rien Revealed serves as a finisher and provides additional card advantage. The deck's power lies in its ability to swiftly apply pressure while disrupting the opponent's plans."
