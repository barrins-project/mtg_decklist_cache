The goal is to assemble the necessary pieces to win the game, such as Thassa's Oracle or The One Ring, and then mill your entire library to win the game on the spot. The deck also incorporates powerful cards like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Emry, Lurker of the Loch to generate early advantage and provide options for recurring important cards. Additionally, there are some disruptive elements like Lightning Bolt and Teferi, Time Raveler to interact with the opponent's game plan."

The deck also includes cards like Thoughtcast and Up the Beanstalk to draw additional cards and ramp up mana.
