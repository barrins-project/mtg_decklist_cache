By playing Amulet of Vigor, the lands enter the battlefield untapped, allowing for explosive ramp and the ability to generate large amounts of mana. The key card in the deck is Primeval Titan, which can search for specific lands like Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and The One Ring. Once these lands are in play, the deck can combo off and deal large amounts of damage to the opponent. The deck also has toolbox creatures like Dryad of the Ilysian Grove and Cultivator Colossus for additional utility."

It aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and disruptive spells while maintaining card advantage through cascade effects. The deck includes a mix of bounce spells, counter spells, and creature removal to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. It also includes powerful cascade targets like Murktide Regent and Crashing Footfalls to quickly apply pressure and generate additional creatures. The mana base is optimized to ensure consistent access to the necessary colors of mana."
