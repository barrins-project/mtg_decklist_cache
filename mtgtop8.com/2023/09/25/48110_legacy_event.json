            "notes": "The key concept of this Bant Control deck is to maintain control over the game by utilizing counterspells and removal spells to hinder the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to consistently disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Force of Will, Daze, and Prismatic Ending, while also providing card advantage and manipulation through Brainstorm and Ponder. Teferi, Time Raveler serves as a versatile tool for controlling the opponent's instant spells and bouncing problematic permanents. The deck also features Temporal Mastery for additional time manipulation and Murktide Regent as a powerful win condition. Overall, the deck focuses on control elements to outlast and outmaneuver opponents."
