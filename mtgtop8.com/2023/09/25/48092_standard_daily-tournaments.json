With cards like Infernal Grasp, Cut Down, and Tear Asunder, the deck has a plethora of removal options to handle opposing threats. The deck also has some card advantage and recursion options with Squee, Dig Up, and Mirrex. Overall, the key idea is to maintain control of the game and overpower the opponent with strong creatures."

The deck focuses on maximizing the efficiency of white creatures by including cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Adeline, Resplendent Cathar, which benefit from the low mana curve. Cards like Hopeful Initiate and Recruitment Officer provide additional creature support, while Ossification and Virtue of Loyalty boost the strength and resilience of the creatures. The deck also includes some removal options like Elspeth's Smite and Cheeky House-Mouse to maintain board control. The mana base consists mainly of Plains with a few utility lands."
