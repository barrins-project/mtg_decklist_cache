The deck aims to take advantage of the affinity mechanic, reducing the cost of artifact spells based on the number of artifacts in play, to overwhelm the opponent with efficient and cheap creatures. The inclusion of Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion provides additional mana acceleration while the land base and card selection focus on ensuring consistent and early aggression. The deck also incorporates a few control elements with cards like Cranial Plating and Shadowspear to enhance combat abilities and disrupt the opponent's strategy."
