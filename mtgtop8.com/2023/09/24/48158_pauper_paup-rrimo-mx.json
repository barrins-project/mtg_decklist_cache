The deck also includes various counterspells, like Counterspell and Force Spike, to disrupt the opponent's plays. Additionally, there are spells like Mutagenic Growth and Snap to provide tempo advantages. The deck aims to quickly establish dominance on the board while keeping the opponent on the back foot, ultimately overwhelming them with creatures and maintaining control through counter magic."
