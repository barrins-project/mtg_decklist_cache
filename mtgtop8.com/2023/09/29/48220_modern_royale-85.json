Additionally, cards like Mishra's Bauble, Preordain, and Thoughtseize help filter through the deck and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also contains some removal spells like Lightning Bolt, Fatal Push, and Dismember to deal with opposing threats."

The deck includes cards that provide pump effects, such as \"Might of Old Krosa\", \"Mutagenic Growth\", and \"Scale Up\", to increase the power and toughness of the Infect creatures. Additionally, the deck includes protection spells like \"Blossoming Defense\" and \"Vines of Vastwood\" to keep the Infect creatures alive and unblockable. The deck also utilizes the Inkmoth Nexus land card to provide an alternate win condition through its animated ability."

The deck also includes disruption elements like Fatal Push and Drown in the Loch to control the opponent's board, and Surgical Extraction to remove key cards from the opponent's graveyard. The goal is to mill the opponent's library completely, leading them to lose the game."
