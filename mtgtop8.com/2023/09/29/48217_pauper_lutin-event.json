This deck focuses on using cheap and efficient enchantments like Abundant Growth, Ethereal Armor, and Armadillo Cloak to enhance Gladecover Scout, Slippery Bogle, and Silhana Ledgewalker. The goal is to create a creature with massive power and toughness, using abilities like Ancestral Mask and Rancor to further increase its strength. The deck also includes some mana acceleration with Utopia Sprawl and Khalni Garden for additional creatures, providing a fast and aggressive playstyle."
