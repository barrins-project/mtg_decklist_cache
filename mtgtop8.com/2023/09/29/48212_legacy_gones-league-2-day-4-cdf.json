The deck also includes various counterspells like Force of Will and Daze to protect your combo, and can generate additional card advantage with Brainstorm and Ponder. The goal is to set up a lethal Dread Return, using the graveyard and creatures like Narcomoeba to win the game."

The deck focuses on using efficient spells like Lightning Bolt and Daze to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also utilizing creatures like Dragon's Rage Channeler and Murktide Regent to quickly close out the game. The inclusion of Force of Will and Force of Negation provides additional protection and disruption. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Mishra's Bauble and Ponder to ensure consistent card selection and advantage."

The deck aims to maintain initiative by playing cards like Fable of the Mirror-Breaker, Forth Eorlingas!, and Touch the Spirit Realm, allowing for continuous pressure on the opponent. It also includes elements of resource acceleration with cards like Ancient Tomb and Chrome Mox, while having access to strong removal options such as Solitude. Karakas and The One Ring provide additional utility and late-game power to seal the victory."
