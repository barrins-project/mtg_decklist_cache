The Faerie Seer, Spellstutter Sprite, Scion of Oona, and Mistbind Clique provide a strong faerie presence on the battlefield to apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck uses a variety of spells like Fatal Push, Mana Leak, Cryptic Command, and Thoughtseize to control the board and counter the opponent's key plays. Bitterblossom provides a continuous stream of faeries, while the land base allows for flexibility and consistency in casting spells."

Additionally, the deck includes pump spells, like Might of Old Krosa and Mutagenic Growth, to increase the power and toughness of the infect creatures. The land base consists of Inkmoth Nexus, Verdant Catacombs, and various dual lands to provide consistent mana for the combo."
