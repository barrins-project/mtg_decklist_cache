            "notes": "The central idea of this deck involves using aggressive and burn-based strategies to quickly deal damage to the opponent. It focuses on minimizing the cost of spells by relying on free cast abilities like Fireblast and reducing the opponent's life total with cards like Price of Progress. The deck includes a high number of direct damage spells such as Lava Spike, Rift Bolt, Lightning Bolt, and Chain Lightning to continuously chip away at the opponent's life total. Additionally, it utilizes efficient and evasive creatures like Goblin Guide, Eidolon of the Great Revel, Monastery Swiftspear, and Skewer the Critics to apply consistent pressure. Roiling Vortex is included to hinder the opponent's ability to gain life and punish them for not paying attention to their life total."
