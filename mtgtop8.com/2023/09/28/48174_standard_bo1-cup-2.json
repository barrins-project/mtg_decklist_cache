Removal spells like Depopulate and Make Disappear help deal with opposing creatures or permanents.

Additionally, the deck includes lands that provide additional utility, such as Boseiju, Who Endures and Mishra's Foundry."

The deck focuses on aggressive gameplay by utilizing cards such as Sunfall, Annex Sentry, Coppercoat Vanguard, and Phyrexian Vindicator to quickly establish a strong presence on the board. It also includes cards like Elspeth Resplendent and Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines to provide additional support and power to the weenies. The deck contains some disruption and removal spells, such as Planar Disruption and Seal from Existence, to clear the way for the weenies to attack. Overall, the deck aims to win through fast, aggressive tactics."
