The deck focuses on fast creature drops with cards like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Blast-Runner, and Voldaren Epicure. It also utilizes burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, and Lava Dart to control the board and deal direct damage to the opponent. The deck includes cards like Experimental Synthesizer, Lotus Petal, and Kuldotha Rebirth to generate mana and efficiently cast multiple spells in a turn. Overall, the key idea is to apply relentless pressure and finish the game quickly."

Counterspell, Spellstutter Sprite, and Spell Pierce help to control the opponent's plays and disrupt their strategies. The inclusion of Mutagenic Growth adds an element of surprise and can enhance the deck's aggressive potential. Additionally, Of One Mind and Smoke Shroud provide additional tools for card draw and creature enhancement. The deck's mana base is centered around Islands, allowing for consistent casting of spells."
