The main idea is to quickly establish control over the game by casting early threats like Goblin Rabblemaster and Legion Warboss. The deck also utilizes disruptive effects such as Blood Moon and Magus of the Moon to hinder opponents' mana bases. By combining these aggressive creatures with artifacts like Chalice of the Void and Trinisphere, the deck aims to create a hostile board state and limit the opponent's options. Additionally, the deck includes a strong mana base with Ancient Tomb and City of Traitors to support its aggressive strategy."
