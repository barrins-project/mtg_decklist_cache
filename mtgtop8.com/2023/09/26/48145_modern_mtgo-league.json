This allows the player to cast powerful spells, such as Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Emrakul, the Promised End. The deck also includes several counterspells like Condescend and Spell Burst, along with card draw and removal spells like Repeal and Fire / Ice. Karn, the Great Creator and Expedition Map help with consistency and accessing specific cards. The deck also has a few utility lands like Academy Ruins and Blast Zone."

The inclusion of Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion adds additional value and an extra source of mana. The deck aims to win through early aggression and efficient spellcasting."

The key idea is to use cards like Persist and Ephemerate to bring back creatures from the graveyard, while also using cards like Faithful Mending and Collective Brutality for card advantage and disruption. The deck includes creature cards with strong abilities such as Archon of Cruelty and Grief, which can quickly turn the game in your favor. The deck also includes some control elements with cards like Teferi, Time Raveler to keep the opponent's strategies in check. The mana base is designed to support both white and black cards efficiently."
