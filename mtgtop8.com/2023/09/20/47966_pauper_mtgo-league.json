The goal is to generate as much mana as possible with cards like Manamorphose and Reckless Impulse, while also casting cheap spells like Needle Drop, replacing them with card draw. Cards like Guttersnipe and Goblin Anarchomancer deal damage whenever a spell is cast, while Goblin Matron acts as a tutor for the necessary pieces. The deck also includes some lands for mana fixing and consistency. Overall, the strategy revolves around efficiently casting spells to burn the opponent's life total."

Brainstorm and Ponder allow for card selection and setting up the desired draws. Augur of Bolas helps to refill the hand by searching for instants and sorceries. The deck also includes a few creatures, such as Azure Fleet Admiral and Crimson Fleet Commodore, to apply pressure and close out the game. The inclusion of snow-covered lands enables the use of Skred to its fullest potential. Lórien Revealed provides an advantage by revealing the opponent's hand."
