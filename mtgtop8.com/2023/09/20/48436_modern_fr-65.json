The deck relies on utilizing cards like Teferi, Time Raveler, Gut Shot, and Eladamri's Call to set up and search for crucial combo pieces. The deck also includes cards like Aether Vial and Imperial Recruiter to quickly tutor and put the necessary combo pieces into play. Additionally, the deck includes protection and disruption elements like Blacksmith's Skill, Ephemeral Shields, and Thoughtseize to ensure the combo can be executed successfully. The deck's mana base is carefully constructed to provide the necessary colors and fix the mana efficiently."
