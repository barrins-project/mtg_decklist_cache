            "notes": "The deck focuses on aggressively using the Death's Shadow creatures to quickly reduce your own life total and increase their power. This is achieved through cards like Grief and Reanimate, while also using disruptive cards like Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to deal with threats on the opponent's side. Overall, the goal is to apply pressure early on and finish the game quickly with powerful and efficient creatures."

By activating Nomads en-Kor's ability to redirect damage to Cephalid Illusionist, the deck can mill its entire library. This triggers Narcomoeba to enter the battlefield, allowing for the casting of Dread Return to reanimate Thassa's Oracle and win the game. The deck includes various counterspells to protect the combo, along with cards like Urza's Saga and Mystic Sanctuary to facilitate consistent drawing and recursion."
