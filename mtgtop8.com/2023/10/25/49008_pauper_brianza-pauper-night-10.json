It features a combination of low-power creatures such as Typhoid Rats and Crypt Rats to disrupt opponents, while also using Avenging Hunter and Troll of Khazad-d√ªm as threats. The deck also includes removal spells like Cast Down and Chainer's Edict to deal with opposing threats. Exhume is used to bring back powerful creatures from the graveyard, and the deck also includes some card draw and life gain elements to maintain resources and survivability."

By using cards like Counterspell, Spell Pierce, and Unexpected Fangs, the deck can effectively shut down the opponent's actions and protect its own key cards. With access to powerful draw spells like Brainstorm, Consider, and Thought Scour, the deck can consistently find the necessary answers. The win condition is provided by the powerful creatures Gurmag Angler, Cryptic Serpent, and Tolarian Terror, which can be played at a reduced cost due to the deck's ability to fill its graveyard. The deck's land base, comprised of Islands, Ice Tunnel, and Contaminated Aquifer, ensures consistent mana access."
