The deck includes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to control the board and manipulate the opponent's hand. Temporal Mastery and Time Warp provide extra turns to further cement control over the game. Counterspells like Logic Knot and Leyline Binding keep opponent's threats in check, while cards like Terminus and Solitude help deal with any remaining threats. The deck also utilizes ramp cards like Up the Beanstalk for additional mana acceleration."
