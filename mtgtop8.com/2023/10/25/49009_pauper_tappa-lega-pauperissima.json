The deck focuses on using control elements and removal spells to keep the opponent's creatures in check while utilizing the Gates to generate extra mana and fix the mana base. This allows the deck to play a variety of powerful spells and creatures while maintaining a solid defense. The deck also includes cards that provide lifegain and card draw, further enhancing its control gameplan. Overall, the deck aims to stall the game and out-value the opponent with its efficient use of Gates and control elements."

It focuses on stalling the opponent's actions and minimizing their threats with various counterspells and removal spells, such as Journey to Nowhere. The deck also includes creatures like Dawnbringer Cleric and Sacred Cat to provide additional defense and gain advantage from Prismatic Strands. It aims to establish a reliable defense through the use of Gates and create a safe environment to win the game."
