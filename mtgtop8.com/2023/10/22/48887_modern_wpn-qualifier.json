It also utilizes powerful creatures like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Troll of Khazad-dûm to pressure the opponent. The deck takes advantage of land interaction with Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth and Field of Ruin to further disrupt the opponent's mana base."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on an aggressive strategy by overwhelming the opponent with cascading spells. The key concept is to utilize the Cascade mechanic by including cards like Shardless Agent and Violent Outburst to cascade into powerful spells like Crashing Footfalls. The deck also incorporates control elements with cards like Subtlety and Mystical Dispute to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Murktide Regent and Questing Beast provides additional threats and versatility. The mana base is optimized to support the key spells and ensure consistent casting."
