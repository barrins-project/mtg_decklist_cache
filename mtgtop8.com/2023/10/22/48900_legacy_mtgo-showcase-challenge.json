It utilizes Aether Vial and Stoneforge Mystic to quickly tutor and deploy powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte, Batterskull, and Kaldra Compleat. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Spirit of the Labyrinth hinder the opponent's spells and draw abilities. Rishadan Port and Wasteland further disrupt the opponent's mana base. The inclusion of Recruiter of the Guard provides additional consistency and flexibility in searching for key creatures. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure while hindering the opponent's resources."

The aggressive creatures, such as Orcish Bowmasters, Troll of Khazad-dûm and Murktide Regent, provide a fast clock and a constant threat to the opponent's life total. The inclusion of targeted removal spells like Fatal Push and Brazen Borrower helps to maintain board dominance."

It also aims to quickly apply pressure with efficient creatures such as Goblin Rabblemaster and Legion Warboss. The deck maximizes its own mana production with City of Traitors, Ancient Tomb, and Chrome Mox, allowing it to deploy threats faster than opponents can handle. The inclusion of cards like Shatterskull Smashing and Fury provides additional removal and reach to close out games."
