The deck utilizes cards like Spinning Darkness, Defile, Cast Down, and Chainer's Edict to remove threats from the opponent's side. It also includes cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Deadly Dispute to disrupt the opponent's graveyard and draw engine. The deck aims to generate card advantage with cards like Reckoner's Bargain and Lembas while also deploying threats like Thorn of the Black Rose and Crypt Rats to close out the game."

The deck also includes ways to generate additional creature tokens, such as Battle Screech and Raffine's Informant. Prismatic Strands and Guardians' Pledge offer protection and additional combat strength. Journey to Nowhere serves as removal for opposing threats. The deck has a strong focus on white mana sources and utilizes Idyllic Grange for additional utility."
