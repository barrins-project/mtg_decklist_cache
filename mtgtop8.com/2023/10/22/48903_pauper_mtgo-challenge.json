It also includes a mix of removal spells like Snuff Out and Devour Flesh to deal with threats, and board control tools like Bojuka Bog. The deck's mana base focuses on a combination of Islands and Swamps with supporting lands like Contaminated Aquifer."

By repeatedly flickering creatures like Mulldrifter and Archaeomancer, the deck can draw extra cards, replay spells from the graveyard, and control the board state. The deck also includes a selection of control spells like Snap and Prohibit to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Sunscape Familiar and God-Pharaoh's Faithful provide additional defensive capabilities and help to lower the overall mana cost of the deck."
