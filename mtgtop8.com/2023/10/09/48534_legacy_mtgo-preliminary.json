It utilizes lands as a primary resource, with cards like Wasteland, Mox Diamond, and Exploration to generate mana advantage. The deck also uses Crop Rotation and Expedition Map to tutor for specific lands, maximizing its control options. Additionally, the deck includes disruptive elements like Pithing Needle and Swords to Plowshares to disrupt the opponent's plans. The win condition of this deck is to create a powerful land-based threat, such as Dark Depths or Thespian's Stage, while managing the opponent's threats and resources with cards like Maze of Ith and The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale."
