By flickering creatures like Sunscape Familiar, Archaeomancer, and Mulldrifter, the deck can draw extra cards, counter spells, and gain life with God-Pharaoh's Faithful. Additionally, Sage's Row Denizen and Murmuring Mystic provide additional value by creating tokens every time a creature enters the battlefield. The aim is to control the game state and overwhelm the opponent with card advantage and repetitive effects."
