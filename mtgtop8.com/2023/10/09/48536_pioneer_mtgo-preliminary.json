It includes cards like Sleight of Hand, Pieces of the Puzzle, and Consider to dig through the deck and find the necessary cards. It also utilizes spells such as Fiery Impulse, Lightning Axe, and Spikefield Hazard to clear the opponent's threats. The inclusion of Temporal Trespass, Treasure Cruise, and Galvanic Iteration allows for powerful late-game plays. The deck also includes additional lands like Hall of Storm Giants and Otawara, Soaring City to support its strategy."
