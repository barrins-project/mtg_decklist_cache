The deck focuses on playing multiple cheap creatures each turn, taking advantage of abilities such as Knight-Errant of Eos's token creation and Recruitment Officer's ability to retrieve creatures from the graveyard. The deck also includes disruptive cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to slow down the opponent. Additionally, there are a few combat tricks and removal spells like Ossification and Brutal Cathar to solidify the deck's aggressive strategy."
