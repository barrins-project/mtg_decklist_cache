It focuses on playing efficient and disruptive creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Dauthi Voidwalker, while also utilizing cards like Fury and Grief to deal with threats. The deck also has a strong graveyard interaction with Orcish Bowmasters and Feign Death, allowing for additional disruption and card advantage. Thoughtseize and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker provide additional disruption and hand control, while the removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Terminate help maintain board control. The mana base is designed to support a mix of red and black spells."

The deck aims to assemble the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Tower, Urza's Power Plant, and Urza's Mine) in order to generate a large amount of mana. This mana is then used to cast powerful threats such as Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Wurmcoil Engine. The deck also includes cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Oblivion Stone to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, there are cards like Sylvan Scrying and Ancient Stirrings to help find the necessary lands and artifacts."
