The deck also includes removal spells like Gleeful Demolition to deal with opposing threats. The inclusion of Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion ensures consistency and provides a valuable mana sink in the late game. Overall, the deck aims to be fast and aggressive, overwhelming the opponent with a flurry of creatures and efficient combat tricks."
