The key concept revolves around utilizing cards like Ignoble Hierarch, Wall of Roots, and Orcish Bowmasters to generate mana and accelerate the game. The deck then utilizes Eldritch Evolution and Chord of Calling to search for and bring out key creatures like Grist, the Hunger Tide, Sheoldred, the Apocalypse, and Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons. Additionally, cards like Blood Artist and Yawgmoth, Thran Physician provide ways to drain and control the opponent's life total. This deck aims to outvalue the opponent through its creature toolbox and combo potential."
