This deck also utilizes cards like Jeska's Will, Galvanic Relay, and Reckless Impulse to draw and filter through the deck to find key combo pieces. The combo is then executed by using Burning Wish to search up specific cards from the sideboard, such as Bonus Round and Wrenn's Resolve, to generate infinite spells and deal a massive amount of damage."
