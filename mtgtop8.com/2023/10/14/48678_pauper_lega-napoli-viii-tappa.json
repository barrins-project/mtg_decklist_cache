Once the Urzatron is assembled, the deck aims to control the game through cards like Candy Trail, Deadly Dispute, and Golem Foundry. It also has the ability to generate additional value through sacrificing artifacts using Ashnod's Altar and Makeshift Munitions. Additionally, the deck includes Weather the Storm as a way to gain life and stabilize against aggressive strategies."

The inclusion of cards like Deep Analysis and Thought Scour allows for card advantage and graveyard interaction. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of tempo, disruption, and efficient creatures."
