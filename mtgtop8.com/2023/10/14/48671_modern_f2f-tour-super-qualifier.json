It aims to quickly ramp up its mana through Arboreal Grazer, Dryad of the Ilysian Grove, and Azusa, Lost but Seeking, and then abuse Primeval Titan's ability to search for specific lands. This allows the deck to assemble powerful land combinations like Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and The One Ring, dealing large amounts of damage. Additionally, the deck includes various utility lands and cards like Summoner's Pact and Urza's Saga to further support its combo strategy."

This is achieved through the use of cards like Street Wraith, Thoughtseize, and Drown in the Loch to both lower your life total and disrupt your opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck utilizes efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember to control the board while putting pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Murktide Regent and Orcish Bowmasters provides additional threats and synergy with the deck's strategy."
