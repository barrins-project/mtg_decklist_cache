The deck includes a mix of powerful artifacts such as Mishra's Bauble, Lotus Petal, and Mox Opal, which allow for quick mana acceleration and card advantage. The inclusion of Urza's Saga and Urza's Bauble synergizes well with Emry, Lurker of the Loch, allowing for additional card recursion and value. The deck also utilizes counterspells like Metallic Rebuke and Force of Will to protect its threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the key concept is to quickly assemble a board state of powerful artifacts and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays."

It utilizes spells like Terminus and Swords to Plowshares to disrupt the opponent's creatures, while cards like Force of Will and Force of Negation allow for instant disruption of the opponent's spells. Additionally, the deck utilizes card draw and manipulation tools like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Teferi, Time Raveler to maintain card advantage and ensure consistency. The inclusion of Leyline Binding and The One Ring provides additional control elements, while Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath offers additional value and resilience. The deck also features a land base that supports multiple colors of mana for maximum flexibility."
