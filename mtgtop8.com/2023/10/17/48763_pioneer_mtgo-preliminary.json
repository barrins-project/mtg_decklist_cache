The deck includes cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner to provide additional value and support. Storm the Festival is used as a powerful late-game card to generate a strong advantage."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on a combo strategy using Retraction Helix. The key idea is to generate mana quickly with cards like Llanowar Elves, Elvish Mystic, and Sylvan Caryatid, while also ramping with cards like Paradise Druid. The deck includes various lands that tap for different colors of mana, allowing for flexibility in casting spells. The combo involves using Retraction Helix to bounce artifacts, triggering abilities and creating a loop with cards like Mox Amber, Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy, and Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast. The deck also includes other powerful cards like Yorion, Sky Nomad and Karn, the Great Creator for added versatility and control."
