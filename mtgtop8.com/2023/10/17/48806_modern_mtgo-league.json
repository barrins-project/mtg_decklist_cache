The key concept of this deck is to use cards like Mutagenic Growth, Lightning Bolt, and Lava Dart to clear the opponent's creatures and protect your own, while also taking advantage of cards like Expressive Iteration and Mishra's Bauble to dig through the deck and find additional resources. The creatures chosen, such as Sprite Dragon, Monastery Swiftspear, and Dragon's Rage Channeler, provide additional value by growing in power as the game progresses."
