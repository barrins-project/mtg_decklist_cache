The deck also includes removal spells like Obliterating Bolt and The Akroan War to control the opponent's board. Additionally, it has some card advantage and utility with cards like Esika's Chariot and Skysovereign, Consul Flagship. Overall, the key concept is to apply constant pressure and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."

Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Thalia's Lieutenant provide disruption and pump up the team, while Luminarch Aspirant and Usher of the Fallen help generate more tokens. Elite Spellbinder disrupts the opponent's hand, while Skyclave Apparition removes threats. Adeline, Resplendent Cathar and Intrepid Adversary provide additional aggression and Chaplain of Alms provides lifegain. The deck aims to quickly establish a board presence and maintain pressure throughout the game."
