The deck aims to apply constant pressure with creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Orcish Bowmasters, while disrupting the opponent's plans with cards like Dauthi Voidwalker and Thoughtseize. It also incorporates some control elements with cards like Terminate and Undying Evil to deal with threats efficiently. The inclusion of Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger adds an additional late-game threat. The deck is further supported by a land base that provides a steady stream of mana and some disruption with Blood Moon."
