By sacrificing creatures like Skirk Prospector and Putrid Goblin, the deck can generate extra mana through abilities like Dark Ritual and First Day of Class. This allows for explosive turns and the potential to combo off. Additionally, cards like Deadly Dispute and Ichor Wellspring provide additional card advantage by sacrificing creatures and artifacts, while Unearth allows for recurring key goblin creatures. The deck also includes disruption with Duress and utilizes the artifact lands for mana efficiency."
