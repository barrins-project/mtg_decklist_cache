The deck also uses sacrifice outlets like Makeshift Munitions and Skirk Prospector to fuel additional card draw and damage. The inclusion of First Day of Class provides added value and helps facilitate the deck's combo potential. Additionally, the deck includes disruption elements like Duress and Nihil Spellbomb to disrupt opponents' strategies."

The deck uses various control cards such as Suffocating Fumes, Chainer's Edict, and Command Performance to slow down the opponent's game plan. It also utilizes card draw and card advantage with Ichor Wellspring and Golden Egg. The deck has a subtheme of sacrificing artifacts and creatures, utilizing cards like Makeshift Munitions and Deadly Dispute. The gates in the deck, such as Citadel Gate and Basilisk Gate, provide additional utility and flexibility. The deck aims to maintain control and outlast the opponent through resource management and strategic decision-making."

The deck focuses on playing walls such as Axebane Guardian, Overgrown Battlement, and Shield-Wall Sentinel to generate mana, while also including cards like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way to draw more cards and find combo pieces. The combo involves using Freed from the Real or Galvanic Alchemist to untap a wall repeatedly and generate infinite mana, which can then be used to win the game with cards like Bloodrite Invoker or Reaping the Graves."
