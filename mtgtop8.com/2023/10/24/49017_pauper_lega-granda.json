It focuses on quickly dealing damage to the opponent by utilizing cheap and efficient burn spells like Chain Lightning and Lightning Bolt. The deck also utilizes creatures with haste like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Bushwhacker to further pressure the opponent. To support this aggressive strategy, the deck includes cards like Reckless Impulse, Kuldotha Rebirth, and Implement of Combustion to generate additional cards or create more threats on the board. The deck also runs mostly Mountain lands for consistent mana production."
