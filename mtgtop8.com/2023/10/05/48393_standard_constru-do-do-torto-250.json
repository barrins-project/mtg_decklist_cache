Key elements include using cards like Zephyr Sentinel, Knight-Errant of Eos, Recruitment Officer, and Lunarch Veteran to quickly build a strong board presence. Additionally, the deck includes disruption elements with cards like Make Disappear and Protect the Negotiators to control the opponent's actions. The land choices of Seachrome Coast, Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire, and Otawara, Soaring City support the deck's aggressive strategy."

The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of efficient creatures, removal spells, and land destruction. Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire provides protection, while the mana base includes Plains, Razorverge Thicket, Secluded Courtyard, and Shattered Sanctum for consistency and color requirements. The Seedcore may serve as a powerful finisher or a way to generate card advantage."
