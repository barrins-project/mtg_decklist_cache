Additionally, cards like Resolute Reinforcements and Valiant Veteran provide combat tricks and buffs to your creatures, further enhancing their effectiveness.

Additionally, the inclusion of memory manipulation effects like Memory Deluge and Siphon Insight allows you to dig through your deck and find the cards you need. The deck also has some powerful late-game threats like The Wandering Emperor and Sheoldred's Edict to close out the game."
