The deck aims to accelerate its game plan by playing multiple lands per turn and tutoring for key lands like Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion. It also includes cards like Arboreal Grazer and Dryad of the Ilysian Grove to further enable land plays. The deck can generate explosive turns and overwhelm opponents with a combination of land-based shenanigans and powerful creatures like Cultivator Colossus."

The deck achieves this by running a combination of cycling creatures like Street Wraith and Architects of Will, along with cascade spells like Violent Outburst, which enable the player to cast Living End for free. The deck also includes various disruptive elements like Force of Negation and Grief to gain an advantage over the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to quickly cycle through cards and disrupt the opponent's strategy, ultimately overwhelming them with powerful creatures."
