It emphasizes graveyard interaction and removal spells to control the board. The deck includes powerful creatures like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Graveyard Trespasser to dominate the battlefield, while also utilizing cards like Virus Beetle and The End to slowly wear down the opponent's resources. It also includes a mix of hand disruption and removal spells like Go for the Throat and Cut Down to further disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes some planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Vraska, Betrayal's Sting to generate additional advantage. Overall, the deck looks to grind out the opponent and control the game through disruption and resource denial."
