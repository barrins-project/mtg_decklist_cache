The deck also includes a mix of removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Leyline Binding to deal with threats, as well as a few powerful win conditions like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Triumph of Saint Katherine. The mana base is designed to provide access to a variety of colors to support the deck's diverse card pool."

It also utilizes discard effects like Faithless Looting and Thoughtseize to further manipulate the graveyard and disrupt the opponent's hand. The deck runs a suite of fast mana in Lotus Petal and efficient fetch lands to ensure consistent and explosive plays. Overall, the key concept is to reanimate high-impact creatures from the graveyard to gain a powerful advantage."
