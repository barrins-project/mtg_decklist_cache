The deck also includes disruptive elements with cards like Giant Killer and Gleeful Demolition to handle opposing threats. Additionally, the deck incorporates a companion, Jegantha, the Wellspring, to provide an additional mana bonus. The deck focuses on aggressive early game plays and maximizing the efficiency of its creatures to overwhelm opponents and secure victories."
