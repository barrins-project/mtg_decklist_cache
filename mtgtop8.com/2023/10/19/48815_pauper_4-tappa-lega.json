This is achieved through cards like Counterspell, Skred, and Lightning Bolt. The deck aims to maintain card advantage and ensure a smooth draw by using cards like Ponder, Thought Scour, and Brainstorm. Additionally, the deck includes creatures like Cryptic Serpent and Tolarian Terror as win conditions. The deck also utilizes land manipulation with Ash Barrens and Snow-Covered lands to fix mana and maximize its potential."
