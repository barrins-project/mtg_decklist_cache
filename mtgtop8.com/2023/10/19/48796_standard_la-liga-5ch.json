The deck focuses on long-term sustainability with cards like Teferi, Temporal Pilgrim and Jace, the Perfected Mind, while also having a win condition through The Eternal Wanderer and The Wandering Emperor. It achieves this by utilizing a mana base that provides both white and blue mana sources."

The deck aims to control the board with cards like Cut Down, Tear Asunder, and Sheoldred's Edict to clear the way for its aggressive creatures. It also utilizes ramp with Up the Beanstalk and Invasion of Zendikar to accelerate its mana and play big threats like Vorinclex and Glissa Sunslayer. Overall, the deck combines efficient removal, ramp, and powerful threats to overwhelm the opponent and win quickly."
