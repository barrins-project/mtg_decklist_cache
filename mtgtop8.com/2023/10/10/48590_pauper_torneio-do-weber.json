It aims to maintain a consistent stream of aggression by utilizing cards like Blood Fountain to gain life and keep the pressure on. Removal spells like Defile and Cast Down help control the opponent's board while cards like Sign in Blood allow for card draw and additional damage. The deck also includes evasion and lifegain elements with Vampire's Kiss and Alms of the Vein. The mana base consists of 16 Swamps and Vault of Whispers to provide consistent black mana for casting spells."
