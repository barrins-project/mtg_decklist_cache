The inclusion of Treasure Cruise and Temporal Trespass provides additional card advantage and potential game-ending plays. The deck also includes some utility lands and counterspells for versatility and protection."

The deck also features a disruptive element with cards like Thing in the Ice and Izzet Charm, which can help control the opponent's board and disrupt their game plan. Overall, the key concept revolves around aggressively utilizing spell recursion and card draw to overwhelm the opponent."

The deck also includes card advantage tools like Light Up the Stage and Kumano Faces Kakkazan to maintain a steady stream of resources. It aims to control the board, deal consistent damage, and finish off the opponent swiftly."
