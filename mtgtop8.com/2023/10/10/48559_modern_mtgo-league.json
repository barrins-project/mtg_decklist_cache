It also has removal spells like Supreme Verdict and Prismatic Ending to deal with threats on the board.

Angel's Grace is used in combination with the combo to ensure that the player cannot lose the game that turn. The deck also includes cards like Thoughtseize and Pact of Negation to disrupt the opponent's strategy and protect the combo."
