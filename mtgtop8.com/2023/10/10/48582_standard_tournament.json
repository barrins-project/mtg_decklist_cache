This is accomplished through cards like Go for the Throat, Make Disappear, Cut Down, and Gix's Command. The deck also focuses on card advantage and resource management with cards like Invasion of Amonkhet, Teachings of the Kirin, and Gruff Triplets. The deck's win condition revolves around powerful creatures like Wrenn and Realmbreaker, Ertai Resurrected, Sheoldred, the Apocalypse, and Mosswood Dreadknight. The mana base provides a mix of colored sources to support the deck's multi-colored spells."
