The deck also uses cards like Arboreal Grazer, Dryad of the Ilysian Grove, and Explore to quickly develop the mana base and enable explosive turns. The deck includes utility lands like Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Vesuva to deal damage and copy powerful lands respectively. Overall, the deck focuses on ramping and quickly assembling its win conditions."
