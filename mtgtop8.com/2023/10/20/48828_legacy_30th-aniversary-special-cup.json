Additionally, the deck is equipped with card selection and filtering spells like Ponder, Brainstorm, and Mishra's Bauble to maintain consistency and find relevant cards. The inclusion of disruptive elements like Force of Will, Daze, and Lightning Bolt ensures the deck can interact with the opponent and control the game."
