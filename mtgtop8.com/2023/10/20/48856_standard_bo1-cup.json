The deck also includes some graveyard recursion with Feldon, Ronom Excavator and Squee, Dubious Monarch. The deck is built to maintain a consistent offensive presence and overwhelm the opponent with relentless aggression."

The deck also includes land destruction with Realmbreaker, the Invasion Tree and Field of Ruin. Overall, the key concept is to control the game state and outvalue the opponent."
