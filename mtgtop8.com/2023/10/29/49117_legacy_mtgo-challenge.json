This allows the player to cast Doomsday, which allows them to stack their deck in a specific order that will result in a win condition. They then use cards like Thoughtseize and Veil of Summer to protect their combo and disrupt their opponent's plans. Finally, they can finish the game with the help of Thassa's Oracle, which ensures a victory if the combo is successfully executed."

The key concept revolves around utilizing a combination of discard spells (Thoughtseize) and countermagic (Force of Will) to disrupt your opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Buried Alive and Ledger Shredder to enable graveyards shenanigans and bring back Arclight Phoenix from the graveyard. The deck also features efficient cantrip spells like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain to dig through the deck and find the necessary pieces for a powerful and explosive game plan."

The deck also aims to disrupt opponents' strategies by using Defense Grid and Karn's ability to shut down their artifacts. It also includes card draw and recursion effects with Echo of Eons and Once Upon a Time. The deck combines elements of combo and control to create a unique and powerful strategy in Legacy 1 vs 1 format."
