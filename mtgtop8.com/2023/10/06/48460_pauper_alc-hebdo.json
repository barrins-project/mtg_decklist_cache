The deck also includes graveyard recursion with cards like Unearth to bring back creatures for additional value. The inclusion of cards like Nimblewright Schematic and Deadly Dispute allows for card draw and additional creature generation. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and disrupt the opponent's strategies."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to create a fast and aggressive Mono Black Aggro archetype in the Pauper 1 vs 1 format. The key strategy revolves around using low-cost creatures like Cuombajj Witches, Chittering Rats, and Liliana's Specter to disrupt the opponent's hand and board, while also dealing damage. The deck also includes efficient removal spells like Cast Down and Chainer's Edict to control the board. Additionally, Gray Merchant of Asphodel is included to provide a powerful finisher, and the inclusion of Witch's Cottage helps with creature recursion."
