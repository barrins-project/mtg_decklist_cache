The deck aims to quickly put pressure on the opponent's life total by playing low-cost creatures such as Strict Proctor, Archon of Emeria, and Giver of Runes. The equipment cards, including Sword of Fire and Ice, Batterskull, and Kaldra Compleat, further enhance the creatures' abilities and allow for effective combat. This deck also includes various tools for disruption and protection, such as Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, Ephemerate, and Solitude. The mana base is optimized with land cards like Eiganjo Castle, Flagstones of Trokair, and Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire. Additionally, Blast Zone serves as a versatile removal option. Overall, the deck focuses on a fast-paced, aggressive strategy while also providing some versatility and protection."

The deck focuses on disruption and removal with cards like Thoughtseize, Fatal Push, and Karn, the Great Creator. It also utilizes the powerful land Cabal Coffers to generate extra mana and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth to turn all lands into Swamps. The deck has a subtheme of graveyard manipulation with cards like Cling to Dust and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse. Overall, it aims to deny the opponent's resources and dominate the game."
