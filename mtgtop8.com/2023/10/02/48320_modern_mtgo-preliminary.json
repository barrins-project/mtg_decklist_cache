The deck also includes control elements like [[Fatal Push]], [[Drown in the Loch]], and [[Field of Ruin]] to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The goal is to establish a strong mill engine with the crabs and then use cards like [[Fractured Sanity]] and [[Tasha's Hideous Laughter]] to accelerate the mill process. Additionally, [[Jace, the Mind Sculptor]] provides versatile card advantage and control options."

The deck also includes control elements with cards like Force of Negation and Mystical Dispute to protect its board position and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck synergizes the Cascade mechanic with aggressive creatures and control elements for a fast-paced and versatile playstyle."

It heavily utilizes countermagic to disrupt opponents' strategies and protect its own threats. The combo of Mishra's Bauble and Expressive Iteration provides card advantage and deck manipulation. Key creatures include Dragon's Rage Channeler and Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer, which can grow in power and provide additional card advantage. Unholy Heat and Lightning Bolt serve as efficient removal spells. The inclusion of lands like Steam Vents and Scalding Tarn allows for flexibility in casting spells of both red and blue colors."
