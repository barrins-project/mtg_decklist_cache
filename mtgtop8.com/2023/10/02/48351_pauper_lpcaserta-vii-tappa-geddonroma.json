This mana is then used to cast multiple spells in a single turn, allowing for powerful combo plays. The deck includes cards that search for more creatures and provide card advantage, ensuring a consistent flow of resources. The walls also provide a defensive wall to protect the player while they set up their combo. Overall, the key concept revolves around utilizing walls and generating mana to execute powerful combo plays."
