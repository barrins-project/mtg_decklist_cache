This deck then aims to use that mana to cast high-impact spells, such as Burning Wish, Galvanic Relay, and Bonus Round, to establish a powerful advantage or win the game. The deck also incorporates cards like Reckless Impulse and Wrenn's Resolve to dig through the deck and protect its combo pieces, while utilizing the legendary creature Birgi, God of Storytelling for additional card advantage and explosive turns. This deck is designed to overwhelm the opponent with its fast mana generation and powerful spells."

The deck focuses on using Goblin Lackey and Rundvelt Hordemaster to cheat in powerful Goblins like Goblin Piledriver and Muxus, Goblin Grandee. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Thorn of Amethyst to slow down the opponent. The deck aims to maximize the Goblin synergies by utilizing cards like Goblin Matron and Goblin Warchief to further enhance the Goblin army. Overall, the deck aims to quickly establish a dominant board presence and deal significant damage."

            "notes": "This deck's main concept is to utilize the Death's Shadow creature to its fullest potential. It aims to quickly reduce its own life total in order to make Death's Shadow a powerful threat on the battlefield. The deck includes various cards that help with life reduction, such as Thoughtseize, Dismember, and Snuff Out. It also features disruptive elements like Brainstorm, Force of Will, and Daze to control the opponent's actions. The inclusion of Grief and Troll of Khazad-dûm provides additional disruptive and aggressive options. Overall, the key goal is to have a low life total while maintaining board control and pressuring the opponent."
