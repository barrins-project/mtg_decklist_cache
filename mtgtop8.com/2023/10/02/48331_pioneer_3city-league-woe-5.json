The deck also aims to utilize the abilities of Adeline, Resplendent Cathar and Coppercoat Vanguard to deal damage to the opponent. It includes various protection cards like Brave the Elements and Ossification to protect its creatures and prevent removal. The deck has a strong focus on white mana sources with cards like Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire and Castle Ardenvale, and includes a mix of creatures and non-creature spells to maintain a balanced strategy."
