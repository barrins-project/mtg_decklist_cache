The deck utilizes creatures like Overgrown Battlement, Axebane Guardian, and Quirion Ranger to generate large amounts of mana and untap creatures. This allows for the casting of powerful spells like Freed from the Real and Third Path Savant to create infinite mana or other game-winning effects. The deck also includes cards like Winding Way and Lead the Stampede to help find the combo pieces efficiently. Overall, the goal is to set up a powerful combo using walls and generate mana to overwhelm the opponent."
