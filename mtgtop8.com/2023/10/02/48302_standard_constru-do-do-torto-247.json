Thalia, Guardian of Thraben provides disruption by making noncreature spells more difficult to cast for the opponent's deck. Ossification helps to protect and strengthen your creatures, while cards like Virtue of Loyalty and Intrepid Adversary provide additional combat benefits. The deck is primarily centered around white creatures and Plains mana sources."
