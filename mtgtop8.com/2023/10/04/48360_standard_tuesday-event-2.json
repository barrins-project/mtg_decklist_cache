The deck aims to outlast the opponent by forcing them to discard cards, prevent them from casting spells, and remove their threats from the battlefield. It also includes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Perfected Mind to generate card advantage and win the game. The deck's mana base is designed to provide a stable source of mana for casting spells and includes utility lands for additional disruption."
