This allows for fast and aggressive plays, overwhelming the opponent with a large board presence. The deck also utilizes various cards that generate card draw and artifact recursion to ensure a steady stream of resources. Additionally, there are some removal spells included to deal with threats from the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to win through aggressive artifact-based strategies."
