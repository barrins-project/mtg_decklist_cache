The deck focuses on removing threats with cards like Lightning Bolt and Skred, countering spells with Counterspell and Dispel, and generating card advantage through Mulldrifter and Archaeomancer. Additionally, the deck utilizes land destruction with Cleansing Wildfire to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the deck aims to maintain control of the game and outvalue the opponent while gradually building towards a win condition."
