The deck is designed to quickly deal damage to the opponent's life total using low-cost and efficient spells like Rift Bolt, Searing Blaze, Lightning Bolt, and Boros Charm. The creatures, Goblin Guide, Eidolon of the Great Revel, and Monastery Swiftspear, are all heavily focused on dealing additional damage and putting pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes a few utility cards like Exquisite Firecraft and Roiling Vortex to counter control strategies. The mana base is optimized for speed and consistency with various fetch lands and dual lands."
