The deck relies on cards like Minsc &amp; Boo, Fable of the Mirror-Breaker, and Fury to quickly deal damage to the opponent. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Chalice of the Void and Magus of the Moon to disrupt the opponent's strategy and limit their options. Additionally, the deck aims to ramp up mana quickly using cards like Chrome Mox, Elvish Spirit Guide, and Simian Spirit Guide to provide an advantage in the early game."
