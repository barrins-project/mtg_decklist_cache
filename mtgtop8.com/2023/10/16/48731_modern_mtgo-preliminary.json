The deck utilizes a combination of aggressive creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Orcish Bowmasters to quickly deal damage, while also using cards like Thoughtseize and Dauthi Voidwalker to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, the deck is equipped with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Terminate to deal with threats. The goal is to maintain board presence, control the opponent's resources, and steadily chip away at their life total to secure a victory."
