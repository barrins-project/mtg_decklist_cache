The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Duress, while also utilizing powerful creatures like Bonecrusher Giant and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger to deal consistent damage. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse to gain value and generate card advantage. This deck seeks to quickly overwhelm the opponent and maintain board control through a combination of creatures and removal."
