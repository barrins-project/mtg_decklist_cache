To further increase card draw and consistency, the deck includes cards like Thoughtcast and Of One Mind. The final touch is the inclusion of All That Glitters, which boosts the power and toughness of creatures based on the number of artifacts on the battlefield."

The deck also focuses on enhancing the power and toughness of these creatures with spells like Might of Old Krosa, Mutagenic Growth, and Embiggen. In addition, the deck includes protective spells like Snakeskin Veil and Vines of Vastwood to keep the creatures safe from removal spells. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, unblockable, and highly buffed creatures."
