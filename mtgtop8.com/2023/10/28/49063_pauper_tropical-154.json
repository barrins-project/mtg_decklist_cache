The deck focuses on generating card advantage through the use of creatures with draw abilities, such as Faerie Seer and Ninja of the Deep Hours, combined with spells that provide card draw, like Snap and Of One Mind. By utilizing cheap creatures and efficient counter spells like Spellstutter Sprite and Counterspell, the deck aims to control the board while continually attacking the opponent's life total. The use of island cards ensures consistent mana generation for the deck's strategy."
