The presence of Vizier of Tumbling Sands and Twiddle allows for additional untap effects to further facilitate the combo. The deck aims to assemble the combo pieces quickly, generate infinite mana, and win through various means such as Thassa's Oracle."

The deck focuses on ramping quickly with cards like Arboreal Grazer and Dryad of the Ilysian Grove, and then utilizing Primeval Titan to search for powerful lands like Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion. The deck also includes some utility lands like Cavern of Souls and Boseiju, Who Endures to protect key spells and creatures."
