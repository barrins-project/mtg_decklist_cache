It aims to quickly and efficiently remove threats with cards like Terminate and Lightning Bolt while also utilizing hand disruption with Thoughtseize and Grief. The deck also focuses on creating card advantage through cards like Not Dead After All and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker. It utilizes powerful creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Dauthi Voidwalker to maintain board presence and apply constant pressure. The mana base includes both fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistent access to all colors of mana."
