It utilizes Stoneforge Mystic to search for key equipment such as Sword of the Meek and Shadowspear to enhance its creatures. Urza, Lord High Artificer acts as a powerful engine, generating value through creating artifact tokens and tapping artifacts for mana. Thopter Foundry and Urza's Saga complement each other, allowing for the creation and sacrifice of artifact tokens to gain life and card advantage. Metallic Rebuke and Esper Sentinel provide disruption and card advantage, while Portable Hole offers removal options."
