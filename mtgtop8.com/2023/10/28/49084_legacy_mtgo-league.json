It utilizes mana acceleration with cards like Lotus Petal and Ancient Tomb to cast high-cost creatures early on. The deck heavily relies on the prison effect of Chalice of the Void to restrict the opponent's spellcasting. Archon of Emeria further disrupts the opponent by limiting their spells and land drops. Solitude provides removal while cards like Touch the Spirit Realm and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker offer additional utility. The deck also includes creatures like Seasoned Dungeoneer and Anointed Peacekeeper for defense and card advantage."
