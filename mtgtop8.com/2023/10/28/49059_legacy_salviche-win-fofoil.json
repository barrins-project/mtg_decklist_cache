The deck utilizes a combination of spells like Brainstorm, Daze, Force of Will, and counterspells to protect its threats while also disrupting the opponent's gameplan. The creatures in the deck, such as Grief, Troll of Khazad-dûm, and Murktide Regent, provide both aggressiveness and resilience, allowing the deck to maintain constant pressure. Additionally, the deck utilizes fetchlands and powerful card draw spells like Ponder and Brainstorm to ensure consistent card advantage and mana fixing."
