The deck focuses on low-cost creatures like Thraben Inspector and Ornithopter to establish an early presence, while cards like Venerated Loxodon and Resolute Reinforcements provide a boost to the entire team. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben disrupts the opponent's game plan, while cards like Gleeful Demolition provide removal and Legion's Landing generates additional value over time. The deck also includes a few utility lands to support its aggressive strategy."

The deck also includes card draw and evasion with Curious Obsession and Shacklegeist. The inclusion of Katilda, Dawnhart Martyr and Invasion of Gobakhan provides additional utility and potential advantage.
