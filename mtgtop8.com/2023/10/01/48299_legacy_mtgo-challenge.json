It focuses on quickly filling the graveyard with cards like Stinkweed Imp, Golgari Grave-Troll, and Careful Study to fuel abilities and triggers from Bridge from Below, Ichorid, and Narcomoeba. The deck also includes cards like Cephalid Coliseum and Otherworldly Gaze to further enable graveyard shenanigans. The aim is to set up a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creatures, spells, and graveyard recursion. Force of Will provides protection and disruption while Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis and Dread Return offer powerful finishers."

Defense Grid helps protect the combo while Karn, the Great Creator can search for key artifacts, and Inventors' Fair provides additional card advantage. The deck also includes cards like Echo of Eons for additional card draw and The One Ring for additional power. The goal is to create a dominating board presence and overwhelm the opponent with powerful artifacts."
