The deck includes a mix of creatures and spells, with Crashing Footfalls providing additional creature tokens, and Shardless Agent and Subtlety cascading into more impactful cards. The deck also utilizes land manipulation with Gemstone Caverns and Boseiju, Who Endures to ensure the success of its cascade strategy."

This allows for efficient aggression by buffing creatures like Arcbound Ravager, Patchwork Automaton, Hangarback Walker, and Walking Ballista. The deck also has ways to generate additional mana with Gemstone Caverns and Springleaf Drum, as well as ways to protect your creatures with Shadowspear. Overall, the key concept is to take advantage of the synergy between +1/+1 counters and artifacts to create a strong and aggressive board presence."
