The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by using cards like Dauthi Voidwalker, Opposition Agent, and Thoughtseize to strip their hand and deny resources. It also utilizes Leyline of the Void and Urza's Saga to shut down graveyard-based strategies. The combo finish involves using Helm of Obedience with a target card in the opponent's library to exile their entire library. The deck also has efficient ramp and mana fixing with Chrome Mox and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth."
