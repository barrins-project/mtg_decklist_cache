It utilizes a combination of removal spells, discard spells, and creatures with abilities that generate value upon entering or leaving the battlefield. The deck aims to take control of the game by disrupting the opponent's strategy and resources, while also having a plan for maintaining card advantage through cards like Ichor Wellspring and Reckoner's Bargain. The land choices, including Golgari Rot Farm and Khalni Garden, provide additional value and options for generating advantage."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's gameplan by countering their spells and removing their threats from the board. The deck also focuses on card draw and selection to maintain a full hand and find the necessary answers to the opponent's threats. It embraces the synergy between UR (red and blue) cards to generate value and maintain control of the game."
