The deck aims to control the battlefield by utilizing powerful creatures like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Glissa Sunslayer, while also utilizing removal spells like Go for the Throat and Cut Down to deal with threats from the opponent. Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and card advantage, while cards like Virtue of Persistence and Blossoming Tortoise help to stabilize and protect the player's life total. Overall, the deck focuses on a fast and aggressive strategy coupled with disruption and removal."
