Brainstorm is also used to dig for combo pieces and manipulate the top of the deck. The deck aims to create a storm of spell casts to generate a massive amount of damage and win the game."

It uses cards like Crop Rotation and Green Sun's Zenith to search for and play these key lands. The deck also includes cards like Knight of the Reliquary and Elvish Reclaimer to help find and protect these lands. It has removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Prismatic Ending to control the board, and some utility cards like Sylvan Library and Mox Diamond for card advantage and mana acceleration."
