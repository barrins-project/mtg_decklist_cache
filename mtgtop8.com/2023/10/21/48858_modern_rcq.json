The deck also includes cards like Roiling Vortex and Searing Blaze to disrupt and control the opponent's board state. Boros Charm, Lightning Helix, and Skullcrack provide additional burn options and utility. The deck has a streamlined mana base with fetch lands and dual lands to maximize consistency and speed."
