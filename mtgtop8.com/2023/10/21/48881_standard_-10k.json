It also utilizes cards like Leyline Binding and Sunfall to further restrict the opponent's options. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Topiary Stomper and Herd Migration to generate additional resources and maintain board presence. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and out-value the opponent."

The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy and preventing them from executing their game plan. The key cards in the deck, such as The Celestus, Shadow Prophecy, and Depopulate, are used to neutralize threats and gain card advantage. Additionally, the deck includes an array of powerful creatures like Atraxa, Grand Unifier, Archangel of Wrath, and Topiary Stomper, which can both control the board and deal damage to the opponent. The deck also includes a mix of lands to ensure proper mana distribution and stability."
