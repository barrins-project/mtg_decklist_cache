The deck relies on cards like Springleaf Drum and Myr Enforcer to produce additional mana to play and equip more artifacts, while cards like All That Glitters and Of One Mind enhance the power and efficiency of the creatures. The inclusion of Metallic Rebuke and Thoughtcast provide card draw and counterspell options for protection and maintaining resources. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive onslaught of artifact creatures."
