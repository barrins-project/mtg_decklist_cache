It employs a mix of powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and win conditions like Shark Typhoon. The deck aims to maintain control of the board while generating card advantage and ultimately outvalue the opponent."

This allows the deck to chain together a series of spells, which can be recurred with Past in Flames, to eventually cast a massive Grapeshot for lethal damage. The deck also includes card selection and card advantage with Preordain, Consider, Gifts Ungiven, and Remand to facilitate its combo and protect itself from disruption."
