The deck aims to quickly assemble a boardstate with powerful artifacts such as Chalice of the Void, Mishra's Bauble, Lotus Petal, and Urza's Bauble to disrupt the opponent's strategy. It also employs counter magic with Metallic Rebuke and Force of Will to protect its own artifacts. Emry, Lurker of the Loch is a crucial card that allows for recursion and further card advantage. The deck's land base includes Urza's Saga, Ancient Tomb, and Seat of the Synod for additional artifact synergy and mana acceleration."

The deck aims to quickly establish control over the game through powerful creatures like Delver of Secrets, Murktide Regent, and Dragon's Rage Channeler, while utilizing Wasteland and other tools to disrupt the opponent's mana base. This aggressive strategy is further supported by the deck's use of counter spells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce, as well as card selection and manipulation with Ponder, Brainstorm, and Mishra's Bauble."

It aims to establish a dominant board presence through creatures such as Elvish Reclaimer, Fiend Artisan, and Grist, the Hunger Tide. It also utilizes cards like Natural Order and Green Sun's Zenith to fetch powerful creatures like Craterhoof Behemoth and Atraxa, Grand Unifier. The deck's mana acceleration is supported by cards like Gaea's Cradle and Noble Hierarch, allowing for explosive plays and efficient mana usage. Ultimately, the key concept is to maintain control of the game and overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures."

It utilizes cards like Crop Rotation, Crucible of Worlds, and Life from the Loam to consistently search for and retrieve powerful lands. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Sphere of Resistance and Maze of Ith to hinder the opponent's strategies. It can generate additional advantage with cards like Urza's Saga and Exploration. Additionally, the deck has a win condition in the form of Dark Depths, which can be combined with Thespian's Stage to create a powerful creature."
