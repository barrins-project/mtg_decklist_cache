The deck also focuses on generating value over time with cards like Horned Loch-Whale and March of Otherworldly Light. It utilizes a variety of lands to provide flexibility and mana efficiency. The overall strategy is to stall the opponent and gradually gain advantage until the player can establish a dominating position and win the game."

The deck also includes cards like Virtue of Loyalty and Ossification to grant additional power and toughness to its creatures, making them even more threatening. Additionally, Hallowed Haunting and Wedding Announcement provide tokens for added aggression. The deck includes a mix of lands to ensure consistent mana production. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, aggressive creatures and maintain a strong board state."

The deck focuses on flooding the board with small creatures like Gingerbrute, Hotshot Mechanic, and Yotian Frontliner, which can be further buffed with spells like Michiko's Reign of Truth and Plated Onslaught. The inclusion of cards like Swooping Lookout and Knight-Errant of Eos adds both evasion and utility to the deck. The deck also utilizes Skrelv, Defector Mite and Glass Casket for removal options. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of threats while maintaining a strong board presence."
