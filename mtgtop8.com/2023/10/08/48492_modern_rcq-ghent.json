Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Dragon's Rage Channeler provide a strong and fast start, while Orcish Bowmasters offers additional damage and removal. The deck utilizes spells like Lightning Bolt, Unholy Heat, and Counterspell to control the board and protect its creatures. Mishra's Bauble and Expressive Iteration provide card advantage and filtering. With a balanced manabase and a mix of disruptive and aggressive spells, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win the game through relentless aggression and efficient spells."
