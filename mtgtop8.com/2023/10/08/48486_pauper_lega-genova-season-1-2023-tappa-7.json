This mana is then used to cast combo pieces like Annoyed Altisaur, Avenging Hunter, and Tuktuk Rubblefort. The deck also includes cards like Boarding Party and Lead the Stampede to help draw into combo pieces faster. The deck aims to establish a high defense with walls and then overwhelm the opponent with powerful combo creatures."
