This is combined with a strong control aspect through spells like Force Spike, Spell Pierce, and Counterspell to disrupt opponent's plans. The deck also utilizes card draw and deck manipulation through Brainstorm, Thought Scour, Ponder, and Deep Analysis to ensure consistency and find key cards. Overall, the deck aims to maintain tempo and control the board while dealing damage steadily to the opponent."
