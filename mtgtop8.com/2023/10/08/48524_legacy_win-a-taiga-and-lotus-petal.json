The deck aims to control the opponent's actions by using Chalice of the Void to limit their spell options, while also utilizing Cavern of Souls to ensure that the deck's creatures can't be countered. The deck also includes various acceleration cards like Chrome Mox and Lotus Petal to quickly establish a mana advantage.

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly and efficiently bring out powerful cards, such as Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, through the use of Show and Tell. This allows the player to cheat these big threats into play without paying their high mana costs. The deck utilizes cards like Cunning Wish and Veil of Summer to protect and search for key pieces of the combo. The deck also includes counterspells like Force of Will to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck focuses on exploiting the Show and Tell mechanic to quickly overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures."
