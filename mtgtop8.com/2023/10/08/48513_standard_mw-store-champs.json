The deck relies on cards like Dissipate, Sunfall, and Syncopate to counter spells, and cards like Make Disappear, Soul Partition, and Temporary Lockdown to remove creatures. Memory Deluge and Quick Study help generate card advantage, while Elspeth's Smite can eliminate problematic creatures. The deck also includes key creatures like The Wandering Emperor and Horned Loch-Whale for additional control and threats. The mana base is designed to provide the necessary colors and support for the deck's strategy."
