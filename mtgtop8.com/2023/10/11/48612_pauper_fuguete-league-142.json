The deck utilizes a combination of removal spells like Cast Down, Suffocating Fumes, and Unmake to deal with the opponent's creatures, along with cards like Castigate and Omen of the Dead to disrupt their hand and graveyard. Meanwhile, creatures like Hopeless Nightmare, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, and Vampire Sovereign provide a consistent source of damage and life gain. The deck also features card advantage and value with Ephemerate, Lembas, and Kor Skyfisher."
