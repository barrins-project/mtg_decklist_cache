The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of small but powerful creatures, such as Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, Adeline, Resplendent Cathar, and Hopeful Initiate. The deck also includes support cards like Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire and Anointed Peacekeeper to protect your creatures. Additionally, Recruitment Officer and Mishra's Foundry help with card advantage and generating additional creatures. Ossification provides a way to strengthen your creatures over time, while Virtue of Loyalty boosts their power. The deck also includes a few utility cards like Extraction Specialist, Skrelv, Defector Mite, and Spellbook Vendor."
