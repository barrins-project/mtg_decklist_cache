It aims to establish early board presence using low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Voldaren Epicure, while also utilizing cards like Goblin Bushwhacker and Kuldotha Rebirth to generate additional creature tokens. The deck also includes a range of burn spells like Chain Lightning, Galvanic Blast, and Lightning Bolt to deal direct damage to the opponent or remove threatening creatures. The artifacts, such as Implement of Combustion and Experimental Synthesizer, provide additional card draw and utility."
