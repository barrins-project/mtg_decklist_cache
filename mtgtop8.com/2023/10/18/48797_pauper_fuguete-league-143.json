These creatures are supported by a combination of protection, evasion, and power boost enchantments to enhance their effectiveness on the battlefield. Additionally, the deck includes a few defensive cards to protect key creatures and maintain board presence. With a focus on white weenie creatures, enchantments, and defensive spells, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and efficient combat abilities."
