This mana is then used to cast powerful creatures like Primeval Titan and Cultivator Colossus. The deck also utilizes land synergies, such as the interaction between Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Dryad of the Ilysian Grove, to deal large amounts of damage to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Urza's Saga and The One Ring provide additional value and versatility to the deck."
