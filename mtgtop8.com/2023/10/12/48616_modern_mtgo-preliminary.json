The deck also utilizes Inkmoth Nexus and Walking Ballista for additional damage potential. The inclusion of Urza's Saga and Gemstone Caverns provide additional ramp and utility. The deck has some land destruction protection with Boseiju, Who Endures and a bit of lifegain with Shadowspear. Overall, the strategy revolves around maximizing the effectiveness of +1/+1 counters to overwhelm opponents with aggressive creatures."

This is achieved through a combination of efficient creatures like Territorial Kavu and Orcish Bowmasters, a mix of versatile removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Murderous Cut, and the use of cards like Grief and Fury to disrupt opponents' strategies and gain an advantage. The deck also utilizes Leyline Binding to further control the game and protect its own creatures, while Up the Beanstalk provides ramp and mana fixing."
