It achieves this through a combination of removal spells, graveyard hate, and creature recursion. The deck also utilizes token generation and life gain to stabilize the board and ensure its own survival. The inclusion of disruptive creatures like Gurmag Angler and Sweettooth Witch adds additional control elements. Overall, the deck aims to outlast and outvalue its opponent, slowly grinding them down while maintaining a strong board presence."
