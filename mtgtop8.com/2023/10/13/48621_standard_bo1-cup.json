The key concept is to maintain a constant stream of threats on the board to pressure the opponent and to have access to a variety of burn spells for direct damage. The deck also includes some recursion elements with cards like Feldon and Squee, allowing for additional value and resilience. The overall goal is to apply continuous pressure and burn the opponent down before they can effectively respond."
