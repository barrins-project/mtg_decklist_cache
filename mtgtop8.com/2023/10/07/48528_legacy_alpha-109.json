The deck also includes counterspells like Force of Will and Pact of Negation to protect the combo.

The deck utilizes Death's Shadow as its primary win condition, taking advantage of its ability to grow in power as the player's life total decreases. It also includes cards like Thoughtseize and Daze to disrupt the opponent's strategy and protect key pieces of the deck. Overall, the key concept of the deck is to apply pressure early while maintaining control over the game."
