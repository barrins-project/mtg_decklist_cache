The One Ring and Pithing Needle are used as control elements to shut down opponent's strategies. Additionally, cards like Crop Rotation and Expedition Map help to search for key lands and assemble the necessary pieces for the deck's combos."

This is achieved by using Painter's Servant to change all cards' colors to a specific color, then activating Grindstone to mill the opponent until two cards with the chosen color are revealed. The deck includes various cards to protect and support this combo, such as Ethersworn Canonist to restrict the opponent's spells, Mother of Runes for protection, and Ingenious Smith to manipulate the top card of the library."
