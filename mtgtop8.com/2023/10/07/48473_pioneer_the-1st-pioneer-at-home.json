The deck utilizes low-cost creatures like Ornithopter, Thraben Inspector, and Legion Loyalist to establish early board presence. Other creatures such as Voldaren Epicure and Regal Bunnicorn provide additional aggression and combat options. Resolute Reinforcements and Embercleave act as powerful finishers to quickly close out games. The deck also includes removal and disruption in the form of Gleeful Demolition. The mana base is focused on providing consistent access to both white and red mana sources for optimal card play."
