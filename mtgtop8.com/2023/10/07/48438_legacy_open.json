            "notes": "The main focus of this Legacy Aggro Dragon Stompy deck is to disrupt the opponent's mana base while employing aggressive creatures to quickly reduce their life total. Key cards include Ancient Tomb, Blood Moon, and Magus of the Moon, which lock opponents out of specific colors of mana, making it difficult for them to cast their most powerful spells. Additionally, Chalice of the Void and Trinisphere further hinder opponents by increasing the cost of their spells. The deck's aggressive creatures such as Goblin Rabblemaster and Fury allow for quick damage output, while Shatterskull Smashing provides additional reach."
