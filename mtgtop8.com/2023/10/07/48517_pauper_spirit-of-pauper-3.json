Combined with creatures like Frogmite, Myr Enforcer, and Ornithopter, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure throughout the game. The deck also includes counterspells like Metallic Rebuke and card draw spells like Thoughtcast to support its aggressive strategy."
