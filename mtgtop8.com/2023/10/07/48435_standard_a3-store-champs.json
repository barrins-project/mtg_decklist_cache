The deck focuses on aggressive strategies, using cheap creatures like Coppercoat Vanguard and Recruitment Officer to quickly establish a threatening board presence. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben adds disruption to slow down the opponent's plans. Additionally, the deck includes support cards like Ossification and Virtue of Loyalty to provide resiliency and protection for its creatures. The inclusion of Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire and Mishra's Foundry provides additional utility and mana fixing."
