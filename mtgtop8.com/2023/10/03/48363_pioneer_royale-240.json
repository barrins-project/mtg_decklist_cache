The deck includes low-cost creatures like Ornithopter, Voldaren Epicure, and Thraben Inspector to establish an early board presence. Resolute Reinforcements and Venerated Loxodon provide a way to pump up the team and generate advantage. The deck also includes removal options like Gleeful Demolition and Giant Killer to deal with threats. The mana base is designed to support aggressive gameplay with cards like Battlefield Forge and Inspiring Vantage."
