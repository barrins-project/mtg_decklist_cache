The goal is to ramp up mana quickly using cards like Sakura-Tribe Elder and Search for Tomorrow, while also fetching necessary lands with Farseek. Primeval Titan acts as a powerful threat and can search for Valakut and other lands. The deck aims to play multiple lands in a turn and then use Scapeshift to sacrifice them all, dealing massive damage with Valakut's ability. The inclusion of Dryad of the Ilysian Grove and Hour of Promise further enhances the land synergy."

The goal is to quickly build a board presence with multiple creatures with large numbers of counters, overwhelming your opponent with their size and power. Additionally, the deck includes some land choices and utility cards to support its aggressive strategy and protect its creatures."
