The deck focuses on generating wide board presence and efficiently utilizing mana by including several low-cost creatures such as Snubhorn Sentry, Knight-Errant of Eos, and Thraben Inspector. The inclusion of Venerated Loxodon and Regal Leosaur allows for strong combat tricks and pump effects, while Clarion Spirit and Resolute Reinforcements provide additional token generation. The presence of removal spells like Gleeful Demolition also ensures the deck can disrupt opposing strategies."
