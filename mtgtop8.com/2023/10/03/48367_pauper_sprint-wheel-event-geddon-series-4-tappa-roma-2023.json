It also incorporates cards like Kuldotha Rebirth and Wrenn's Resolve to generate additional creatures and protect them. Finally, the deck includes cards like Goblin Bushwhacker and Monastery Swiftspear to maximize damage output and finish the game quickly. The deck's efficient mana base, utilizing mainly Mountains and Great Furnaces, ensures smooth, fast gameplay."
