This allows for powerful land interactions and the ability to generate a significant amount of mana. The goal is to quickly assemble a board state with multiple powerful lands and overwhelm the opponent with the deck's combination of land-based abilities."

The combo aspect of the deck is further enhanced by cards like Tasha's Hideous Laughter and Surgical Extraction, which can exile large portions of the opponent's deck. Overall, the deck aims to deplete the opponent's library quickly and ultimately win through mill."

            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to assemble a powerful, fast combo using the \"Hammer Time\" strategy. The deck focuses on equipping creatures with powerful equipment like Colossus Hammer and Shadowspear to create huge threats on the battlefield. It also utilizes cards like Puresteel Paladin and Stoneforge Mystic to search for and play these equipment cards efficiently. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of high-power creatures and necessary equipment, while also having access to cards like Surge of Salvation and Emeria's Call for additional value and protection."
