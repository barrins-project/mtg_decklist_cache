This mana is then used to play powerful threats like Karn Liberated, Karn, the Great Creator, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The deck also includes tools for card selection and filtering (Chromatic Sphere, Ancient Stirrings) as well as removal and disruption (Dismember, Oblivion Stone). Overall, the goal is to establish a dominant board presence while slowing down and disrupting the opponent's game plan."
