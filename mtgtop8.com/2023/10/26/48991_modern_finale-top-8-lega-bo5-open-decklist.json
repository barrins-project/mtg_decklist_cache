It focuses on putting pressure on opponents early on with cards like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Orcish Bowmasters, while also disrupting their plans with Thoughtseize and Grief. The deck also incorporates cards like Dauthi Voidwalker and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker to stall and control the opponent's resources. Additionally, it includes removal spells like Terminate and Lightning Bolt to deal with threats. The mana base is built to provide consistent access to both red and black mana sources."
