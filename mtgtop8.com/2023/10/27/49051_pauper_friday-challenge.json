The deck utilizes pump spells such as Might of Old Krosa and Vines of Vastwood to enhance the power and toughness of these creatures. It also incorporates card draw and manipulation with Ponder and Brainstorm to maintain a steady flow of resources. Additionally, the deck includes Saiba Cryptomancer and Embiggen to further boost the creatures' abilities. The land base consists of both Islands and Forests, with Ash Barrens and Thornwood Falls providing color fixing and additional mana sources."
