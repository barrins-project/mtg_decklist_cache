The deck focuses on playing low-cost creatures and spells that can quickly build up a board presence and deal damage to the opponent. Cards like March of Burgeoning Life, Fading Hope, and Distorted Curiosity provide additional value and card advantage. The deck also includes some evasion and protection elements with Combat Research and Security Bypass. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of early aggression and powerful synergies between creatures and spells."
