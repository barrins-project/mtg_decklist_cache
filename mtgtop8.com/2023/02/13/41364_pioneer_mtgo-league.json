Additional sacrifice outlets like Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and Deadly Dispute provide more opportunities to trigger beneficial effects. The inclusion of cards like Claim the Firstborn and Fatal Push helps disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining pressure on the battlefield. Ultimately, the deck's goal is to overwhelm the opponent with sacrificial synergies and efficient removal."
