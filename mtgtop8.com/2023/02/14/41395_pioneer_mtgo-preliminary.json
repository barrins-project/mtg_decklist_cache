Cards like Claim the Firstborn and Fatal Push help control the board while Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and The Meathook Massacre provide additional payoff for sacrificing creatures. The mana base is designed to provide the necessary colors for the deck's spells while also supporting aggressive plays."

By utilizing cards like Collected Company and Kayla's Reconstruction, the deck can flood the board with powerful creatures like Righteous Valkyrie, Youthful Valkyrie, and Skyclave Apparition. The life gain synergy provided by Giada, Font of Hope, Resplendent Angel, and Bishop of Wings helps to stabilize the player's life total while maintaining pressure on the opponent. With a mix of creatures, spells, and lands that provide utility and consistency, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggression and resilience."
