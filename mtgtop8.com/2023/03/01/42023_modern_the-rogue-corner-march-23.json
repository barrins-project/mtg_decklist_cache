The deck utilizes a combination of aggressive creatures such as Bonecrusher Giant and Frost Titan, along with powerful support spells like Invasion of the Giants and Lightning Bolt. It aims to establish early board presence and maintain pressure throughout the game. The deck also includes some utility cards like Coalition Relic for mana acceleration and disruption. Overall, the strategy revolves around playing large, impactful creatures and utilizing their abilities to dominate the battlefield."
