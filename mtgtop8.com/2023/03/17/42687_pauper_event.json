The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's plans through counterspells and removal spells like Snuff Out and Agony Warp. The deck also aims to generate card advantage with cards like Deep Analysis and Thought Scour. The win condition is primarily through the large creature Gurmag Angler, which can be cast for a reduced cost using the graveyard-filling effects of cards like Mental Note and Tolarian Terror. The deck also includes some lifegain options with Unexpected Fangs to help sustain and prolong the game."
