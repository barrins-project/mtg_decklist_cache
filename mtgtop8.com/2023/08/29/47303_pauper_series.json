The deck features a mix of creatures for defensive purposes, such as Guardian of the Guildpact and Sacred Cat, as well as some gate-specific creatures like Squadron Hawk and Inspiring Overseer. Open the Gates is used to search for specific gates, while Lórien Revealed provides card advantage. Journey to Nowhere and Planar Disruption offer removal options."

The deck is built around a combination of control elements, such as Counterspell and Journey to Nowhere, along with cards that can draw extra cards or filter the hand, like Brainstorm and Preordain. The Gate cards provide additional mana consistency, allowing for efficient casting of spells. Overall, the deck aims to maintain control of the board while gradually outvaluing the opponent through card advantage and superior resource management."
