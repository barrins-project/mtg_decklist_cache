The deck aims to control the opponent's actions by countering their spells and removing their creatures, while also generating card advantage through spells like Brainstorm, Thought Scour, and Mental Note. It also utilizes powerful creatures like Cryptic Serpent and Gurmag Angler to apply pressure and close out games. Additionally, the deck includes some life gain with Unexpected Fangs to help stabilize against aggressive opponents. The land base is focused on generating blue mana with a splash of black."

The deck focuses on using cheap spells like Preordain, Lightning Bolt, and Skred to control the board and remove threats. Delver of Secrets and Tolarian Terror are the main creatures that can deal consistent damage to the opponent, while Murmuring Mystic provides additional creature generation. The deck also includes counterspells like Counterspell and Dispel to protect your own creatures and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure and maintain control in order to win the game efficiently."
