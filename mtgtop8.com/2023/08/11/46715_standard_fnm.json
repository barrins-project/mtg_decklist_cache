The deck focuses on playing aggressive creatures like Venerated Rotpriest, Jawbone Duelist, Crawling Chorus, and Skrelv, Defector Mite to attack the opponent's life total. It also includes powerful spells like Invasion of Ikoria, Bring the Ending, and Prologue to Phyresis to control the board and deal with any threats. The deck aims to maintain a strong board presence and apply constant pressure to defeat the opponent quickly."
