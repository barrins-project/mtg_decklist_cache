The deck focuses on utilizing cards like Endurance, Fury, and Greater Gargadon to hinder the opponent's plans and maintain board presence. It also includes Green Sun's Zenith and Once Upon a Time to search for specific creatures when needed. The deck further leverages cards like Titania, Protector of Argoth and Veteran Explorer to gain an advantage in resource generation. Overall, this deck aims to outlast the opponent and dismantle their game plan through careful control and resource management."
