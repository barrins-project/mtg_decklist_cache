The deck also includes cards like Flood of Tears and Make Disappear to disrupt the opponent's board. The inclusion of cards like Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner and Leyline of Anticipation suggests a focus on mana acceleration and flash (the ability to play spells at instant speed). Overall, this deck aims to quickly establish a strong board presence and maintain control of the game through efficient plays and disruptive tactics."
