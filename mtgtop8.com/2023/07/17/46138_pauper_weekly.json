The deck utilizes cheap creatures like Glint Hawk, Kor Skyfisher, and Thraben Inspector to constantly pressure the opponent while also having access to Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast to deal additional damage. The deck also includes cards like Makeshift Munitions and Boros Garrison to optimize mana efficiency and card draw with cards like Ichor Wellspring. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm and quickly defeat the opponent by maintaining a relentless assault."
