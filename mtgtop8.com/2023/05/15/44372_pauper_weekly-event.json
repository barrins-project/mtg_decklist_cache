It aims to generate value through sacrificing creatures with abilities like Carrion Feeder and Mortician Beetle, while also fueling card draw with Village Rites. It includes removal spells like Defile and Deadly Dispute to control the opponent's board. The deck also includes cards like Nested Shambler and Gixian Infiltrator to create a resilient and evasive threat. Overall, the key concept is to create a fast and consistent aggressive strategy with Mono Black creatures."
