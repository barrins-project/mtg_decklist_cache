The deck also utilizes cards like Dawnbringer Cleric and Stonehorn Dignitary for defense and disruption. Cleansing Wildfire and Journey to Nowhere are included to deal with problematic lands and creatures. The deck aims to maintain board presence and apply a steady stream of damage to overwhelm the opponent and secure victories."
