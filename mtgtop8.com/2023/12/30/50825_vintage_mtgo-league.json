            "notes": "The key concept of this deck revolves around utilizing the powerful interaction between the graveyard and the battlefield. By discarding cards such as Basking Rootwalla, Blazing Rootwalla, Hollow One, and Vengevine, players can quickly fill their graveyard and bring multiple creatures back onto the battlefield. This strategy is enhanced by the inclusion of Bazaar of Baghdad, Serum Powder, Noxious Revival, and Squee, Goblin Nabob. Additionally, the deck contains various disruptive elements such as Force of Vigor, Force of Negation, Mindbreak Trap, and Force of Will to control the game and protect its creatures."
