By repeatedly flickering creatures and other permanents, the deck aims to generate value and advantage. It combines cards like Augur of Bolas, Mulldrifter, and Archaeomancer with flicker spells like Ephemerate and Lórien Revealed to continuously trigger their enter-the-battlefield effects. This allows the player to draw cards, gain mana advantage, and control the board. Additional cards like Skred, Counterspell, and Destroy Evil provide control and removal options, while Brainstorm and Preordain help with card selection and manipulation."
