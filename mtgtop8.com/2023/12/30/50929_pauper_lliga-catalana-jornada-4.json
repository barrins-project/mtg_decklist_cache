The deck utilizes the Affinity mechanic to reduce the cost of its cards based on the number of artifacts in play. It also includes spells that allow for card draw and protection. The Aggro strategy focuses on attacking the opponent's life total directly and using synergistic cards like All That Glitters to enhance the power of its creatures. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle."

The deck aims to counter opponent's spells with cards like Counterspell and Spell Pierce, while also utilizing targeted removal like Cast Down and Chainer's Edict. It also includes cards to generate additional value such as Augur of Bolas and Murmuring Mystic. Additionally, the deck features draw spells like Ponder and Brainstorm to increase consistency and options. The mana base includes both Islands and Swamps to support the Dimir control strategy."
