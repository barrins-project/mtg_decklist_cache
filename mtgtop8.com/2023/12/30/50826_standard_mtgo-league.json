The inclusion of Nissa, Ascended Animist and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse provides additional value and threats. The deck's mana base is designed to support a mix of black and green spells, with some utility lands like Boseiju, Who Endures and Takenuma, Abandoned Mire."

The goal is to quickly ramp up mana with cards like Herd Migration and Up the Beanstalk, while also playing powerful creatures like Topiary Stomper and Archangel of Wrath to control the board. The deck also includes cards like Leyline Binding and Depopulate to further control the opponent's board state. Additionally, the inclusion of Atraxa, Grand Unifier allows for potential synergies with +1/+1 counters and proliferate effects."
