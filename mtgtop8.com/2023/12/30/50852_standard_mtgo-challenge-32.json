Venerated Rotpriest and Annex Sentry offer additional removal options, while Jawbone Duelist and Skrelv, Defector Mite provide aggressive bodies. The deck also includes a small land package for mana consistency."

Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Faerie Dreamthief and Preacher of the Schism to disrupt the opponent's strategies.

The deck focuses on controlling the board with cards like Leyline Binding, Invasion of Alara, and Cemetery Desecrator, as well as generating card advantage with Virtue of Persistence and Herd Migration. Additionally, the deck includes powerful creatures like Atraxa, Grand Unifier and Glissa Sunslayer to apply pressure and ultimately secure victory."
