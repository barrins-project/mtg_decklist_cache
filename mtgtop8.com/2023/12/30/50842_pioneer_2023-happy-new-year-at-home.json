            "notes": "This deck focuses on controlling the game by utilizing cards like Fable of the Mirror-Breaker, Temporary Lockdown, and Touch the Spirit Realm to disrupt the opponent's strategies. The key concept is to take advantage of the Fires of Invention enchantment, which allows you to cast spells for free on your turn as long as you only play two spells that turn. This allows you to deploy powerful creatures like Keruga, the Macrosage, Sheoldred, the Apocalypse, and Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines without having to pay their mana costs. Additionally, the deck includes Leyline Binding to further control the opponent's board state and Enigmatic Incarnation to tutor for specific creatures."
