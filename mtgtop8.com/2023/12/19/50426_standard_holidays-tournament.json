It focuses on playing powerful creatures like Kumano Faces Kakkazan and Ixalli's Lorekeeper to quickly dominate the board. Monstrous Rage and Triumphant Chomp provide additional ways to boost the damage output of the creatures. The deck also includes cards like Pugnacious Hammerskull and Belligerent Yearling to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base consists of a mix of Forests, Mountains, and dual lands like Karplusan Forest and Copperline Gorge to ensure consistent and efficient mana production."
