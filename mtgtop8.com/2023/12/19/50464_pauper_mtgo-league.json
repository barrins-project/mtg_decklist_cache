Apostle's Blessing and Mutagenic Growth provide protection and pump up the creatures, while Crash Through and Lava Dart offer additional damage output. Temur Battle Rage can deliver lethal damage by granting double strike. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a relentless and explosive attack."

The deck includes cards that generate tokens, such as Battle Screech and Squadron Hawk, to provide additional creatures for defense and offense. Prismatic Strands allows for protection from certain types of damage, while Journey to Nowhere removes opponent's threats. The deck also includes various lifegain options, such as Lunarch Veteran and Dawnbringer Cleric, to sustain and outlast opponents. Overall, the key concept is to maintain board presence and control through the use of gates and defensive creatures."
