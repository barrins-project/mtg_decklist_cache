The deck focuses on utilizing powerful creatures and spells, such as Archangel of Wrath and Invasion of Zendikar, to maintain board presence and limit the opponent's options. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Leyline Binding and Cavern of Souls to protect and enhance its creatures. Ultimately, the goal is to establish a dominant position on the battlefield and outlast the opponent through efficient control and intelligent decision-making."
