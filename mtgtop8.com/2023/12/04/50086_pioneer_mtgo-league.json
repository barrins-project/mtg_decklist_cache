It also utilizes powerful graveyard recursion with cards like Cling to Dust and Bitter Triumph to constantly bring back Arclight Phoenix and maintain board presence. The mana base includes a mix of lands that provide different colors and utility, such as Hall of Storm Giants for card advantage and Hive of the Eye Tyrant for additional creature destruction. The goal is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a combination of powerful creatures and disruptive spells."
