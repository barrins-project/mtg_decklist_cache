The deck includes cards like Orochi Leafcaller, Saruli Caretaker, and Axebane Guardian to help produce mana. The walls also provide defense against the opponent's attacks. The deck includes cards like Drift of Phantasms and Lead the Stampede to search for important combo pieces. The combo piece, Freed from the Real, allows the player to generate infinite mana, which can be used to cast powerful spells. The deck also includes card draw and graveyard recursion for added consistency."
