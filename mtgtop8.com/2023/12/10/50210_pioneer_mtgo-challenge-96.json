The key concept is to quickly and efficiently cast spells to trigger the Arclight Phoenix's ability to return it from the graveyard to the battlefield. The deck includes several cheap spells like Lightning Axe, Fiery Impulse, and Opt to trigger this ability consistently. It also utilizes card draw spells like Treasure Cruise and Consider to maintain a full hand of spells. The deck also includes a few disruptive elements like Spell Pierce and Jwari Disruption to protect its strategy and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
