By generating extra mana and untapping the lands, the deck can quickly ramp and play big threats like Primeval Titan. The deck also uses cards like Dryad of the Ilysian Grove and Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle to create a powerful landfall and ramp engine, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with a combination of large creatures and lethal direct damage."
