The deck includes various Elves that can generate mana, allowing for quick deployment of creatures. Additionally, there are cards like Timberwatch Elf and Wellwisher that can boost the power and stability of the Elf army. The deck also contains card draw spells like Distant Melody and Lead the Stampede to maintain a steady stream of resources. The inclusion of Vines of Vastwood can provide protection or enhance the power of the Elves when necessary."
