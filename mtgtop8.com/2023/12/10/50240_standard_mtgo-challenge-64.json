The key concept of this deck is to maintain board control and disrupt the opponent's strategies through a combination of creature removal, counter spells, and evasive creatures. The deck utilizes certain synergies such as Mindlink Mech to draw cards, Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor to provide card advantage, and Faerie Mastermind to bounce and replay creatures. The deck also includes evasive creatures like Spyglass Siren and Malcolm, Alluring Scoundrel to deal direct damage. Overall, the key concept is to provide constant pressure and disruption to the opponent."
