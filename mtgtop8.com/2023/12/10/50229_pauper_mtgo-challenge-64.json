The deck aims to outlast the opponent by utilizing cards like Drown in Sorrow and Crypt Rats to clear the board, while also generating card advantage with Ichor Wellspring and Deadly Dispute. The deck also includes a small token theme with cards like Khalni Garden and Fanatical Offering to generate additional resources. Overall, the deck focuses on disruption and resource management to wear down the opponent and secure victory."

The deck aims to control the opponent's resources while efficiently dealing damage through the use of creatures like Avenging Hunter and Annoyed Altisaur. The inclusion of Skred and Mwonvuli Acid-Moss allows for disruption and land destruction, further hindering the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck aims to win the game through fast and aggressive plays."
