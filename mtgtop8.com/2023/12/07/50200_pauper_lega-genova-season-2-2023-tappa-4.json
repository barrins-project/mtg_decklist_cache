These flicker effects allow you to repeatedly trigger enter-the-battlefield abilities, such as those on God-Pharaoh's Faithful and Sea Gate Oracle, to gain advantages and generate card advantage. The deck also includes control elements like Prohibit and Essence Scatter to disrupt and slow down opponents. The goal is to overwhelm opponents with card advantage and generate powerful combos through flickering effects."

The deck focuses on flickering creatures like Archaeomancer, Augur of Bolas, Mulldrifter, and Murmuring Mystic to generate card advantage and value. It also includes spells like Ephemerate and Lórien Revealed to further enable flicker effects. The deck includes a mix of removal spells like Lightning Bolt, Skred, and Cleansing Wildfire to control the board. Counterspells provide protection and disruption. The mana base includes various dual lands and snow-covered lands for consistency. The overall strategy is to create a strong board presence and maintain resource advantage through flickering and combo plays."
