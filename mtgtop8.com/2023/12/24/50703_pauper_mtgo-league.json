The deck has a snow sub-theme, using Snow-Covered lands and cards like Skred and Cleansing Wildfire for additional flexibility. Overall, the key concept of the deck is to create a powerful engine through flickering creatures and spells, while maintaining control of the game and disrupting the opponent's strategy."

Lead the Stampede and Distant Melody help refill the hand and maintain card advantage. Timberwatch Elf is a key threat, able to pump up other Elves and deal massive amounts of damage. The deck includes some control elements with Dispel to protect its creatures and Priest of Titania and Llanowar Elves to generate additional mana. Forests provide the necessary mana base for the Elf swarm."
