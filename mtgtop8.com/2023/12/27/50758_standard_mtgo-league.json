The key concept is to gradually gain control of the game by ramping up resources with cards like Herd Migration and Up the Beanstalk, while also protecting your creatures with Archangel of Wrath and Atraxa, Grand Unifier. Leyline Binding and Virtue of Persistence help in maintaining control over the opponent's board. The deck aims to establish dominance and overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures like Topiary Stomper."
