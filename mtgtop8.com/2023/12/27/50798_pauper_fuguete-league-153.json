The Modern Age, LÃ³rien Revealed, and Brainstorm provide card advantage and manipulation. Prismatic Strands acts as a protection spell. Journey to Nowhere removes threats, and the gates, such as Basilisk Gate and Sea Gate, provide mana fixing and additional benefits. The deck aims to establish a strong defense and control the game until it can win through attrition or a big finisher like Guardian of the Guildpact."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to utilize the combo and reanimation mechanics to quickly and efficiently bring powerful creatures back from the graveyard. The deck includes cards like Gnaw to the Bone, Dread Return, and Acorn Harvest to fuel the graveyard and generate value. Satyr Wayfinder and Mire Triton help with card selection and filling the graveyard. The deck focuses on creatures like Blanchwood Prowler, Generous Ent, and Troll of Khazad-dÃ»m which can be reanimated and provide a strong board presence. Lotleth Giant and Scrapwork Mutt serve as finishers, while Stinkweed Imp helps with graveyard filling and card advantage. The land base consists of a mixture of Swamps, Forests, Haunted Mire, Geothermal Bog, and Wooded Ridgeline to support the deck's consistent mana requirements."
