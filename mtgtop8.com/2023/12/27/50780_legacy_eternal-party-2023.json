Paradox Engine and Voltaic Key provide additional mana and untapping abilities, while Defense Grid protects the combo from disruption. The goal is to assemble the pieces and generate enough mana to cast multiple spells per turn, controlling the game and overwhelming the opponent. Karn, the Great Creator and Urza's Saga provide additional utility and win conditions."
