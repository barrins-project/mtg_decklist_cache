The deck includes cards like Red Elemental Blast and Pyroblast to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's plays. Additionally, Karn, the Great Creator and Goblin Engineer provide artifact tutor and recursion, while cards like Lotus Petal and Mox Opal help generate the necessary mana to execute the combo."
