The Modern Age, Ephemerate, and Ghostly Flicker are key flicker spells that allow for multiple triggers and card recursion. Control elements such as Prohibit and Lose Focus are included to protect the combo pieces. Preordain and Deep Analysis offer additional card selection and draw power."

This is achieved by using low-cost creatures with disruptive abilities such as Faerie Miscreant, Spellstutter Sprite, and Brinebarrow Intruder. The deck also incorporates bounce effects like Snap and Ninja of the Deep Hours to continuously draw cards and provide evasion for its creatures. Additionally, the deck includes efficient counterspells like Counterspell and Spell Pierce to disrupt opponents' strategies. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a relentless aggro strategy while also maintaining card advantage."
