It also includes cards like Depopulate, Sunfall, and Leyline Binding to disrupt the opponent's strategies and remove their threats. The deck utilizes mana acceleration with cards like Up the Beanstalk and Invasion of Zendikar to quickly ramp up and cast its high-cost creatures. The inclusion of Cavern of Souls and Boseiju, Who Endures helps protect against countermagic and removal spells. Overall, the deck aims to establish board control and overwhelm the opponent."
