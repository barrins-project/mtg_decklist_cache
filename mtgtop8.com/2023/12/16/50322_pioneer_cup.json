It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Dovin's Veto and Hallowed Moonlight, while also utilizing board wipes like Supreme Verdict to clear the battlefield. The deck further gains card advantage through cards like Dig Through Time and Memory Deluge. It also has a win condition in Shark Typhoon, which can create a large flying threat while being protected by counterspells. The deck focuses on efficient removal and lock-down effects to maintain control throughout the game."
