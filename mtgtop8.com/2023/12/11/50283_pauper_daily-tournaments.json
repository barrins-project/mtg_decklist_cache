            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and boost their power with various spells and enchantments. The deck focuses on using low-cost creatures like Chicken Troupe, Young Wolf, and Nest Invader to quickly establish a strong board presence. The deck also includes spells like Savage Swipe, Vines of Vastwood, and Snakeskin Veil to protect and strengthen the creatures. Additionally, enchantments like Rancor and Elephant Guide provide additional power and resilience. The main strategy is to apply constant pressure on the opponent and quickly finish the game."
