It utilizes cards like Forth Eorlingas! and Lotus Petal to quickly generate mana and deploy threats. Chalice of the Void and Archon of Emeria provide additional disruption to slow down the opponent's game plan. Anointed Peacekeeper and Solitude offer protection and removal, while Seasoned Dungeoneer provides card draw. The mana base is built to support the deck's color requirements and maximize efficiency. Overall, the goal is to establish early board presence and maintain control throughout the game."
