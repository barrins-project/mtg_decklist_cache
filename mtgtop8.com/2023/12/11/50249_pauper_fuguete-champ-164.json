The deck focuses on playing low-cost creatures like Goblin Tomb Raider, Goblin Blast-Runner, Voldaren Epicure, and Goblin Bushwhacker to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. It also includes burn spells like Galvanic Blast, Lightning Bolt, and Seal of Fire to deal direct damage and control the board. The deck aims to maintain a high level of aggression and pressure throughout the game to secure a quick victory."
