The deck focuses on utilizing low-cost, efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage, along with burn spells like Wild Slash and Play with Fire, to deal damage early in the game. The inclusion of cards like Roiling Vortex and Chandra, Dressed to Kill further enhances the deck's ability to deal damage and maintain board control. Additionally, the deck utilizes lands like Ramunap Ruins and Den of the Bugbear to further support its aggressive strategy."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to create a fast-paced aggressive strategy focused on utilizing Spirit creatures. By combining low-cost Spirit creatures like Rattlechains, Mausoleum Wanderer, and Supreme Phantom with disruption cards like Spell Queller and Lofty Denial, the deck aims to control the game while steadily dealing damage. Card draw and card advantage are emphasized through Curious Obsession and Spectral Sailor. The deck also includes utility cards like Shacklegeist and Geistlight Snare to further disrupt opponents. The inclusion of a couple of unique legendary creatures, Katilda and Otawara, adds versatility to the deck."
