These creatures are supported by spells like Leyline Binding and Up the Beanstalk to further assert control over the board. The deck also includes lands like Cavern of Souls and Boseiju, Who Endures, which provide protection for the creatures and spells. The deck aims to stall the opponent's game plan with cards like Depopulate and Invasion of Zendikar, while also generating value with Nissa, Ascended Animist and card draw from cards like Sunfall. The deck also has strong ramp potential with Jetmir's Garden and Spara's Headquarters, allowing for a quicker deployment of its threats on the board."
