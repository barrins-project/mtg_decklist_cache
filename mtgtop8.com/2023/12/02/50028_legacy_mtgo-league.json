The deck utilizes cards like Chrome Mox, Simian Spirit Guide, and City of Traitors to generate fast mana and play multiple Goblins in a single turn. Cards like Goblin Rabblemaster, Battle Cry Goblin, and Muxus, Goblin Grandee provide powerful effects that buff the Goblins and generate additional value. The deck aims to deal fast and consistent damage by using its Goblin creatures to attack relentlessly."
