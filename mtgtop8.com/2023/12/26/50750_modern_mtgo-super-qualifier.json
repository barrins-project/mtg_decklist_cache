            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is centered around aggression and utilizing the synergy between Rakdos cards. The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent by playing efficient aggressive creatures like Orcish Bowmasters and Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer. It also incorporates disruption elements with cards like Thoughtseize and Dauthi Voidwalker to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Terminate to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the key concept is to combine aggressive creatures, disruption, and removal to maintain a dominant board presence and apply pressure to the opponent."
