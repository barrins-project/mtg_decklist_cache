The deck includes creatures with abilities that allow them to generate multiple creatures or gain additional value. It also includes cards that provide card draw and protection for the creatures. The deck focuses on quickly playing creatures and overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of creatures, while also utilizing pump spells to boost their power and toughness. The deck relies heavily on the Forest land type to provide enough mana to play its creatures and spells."
