The deck aims to quickly put down big creatures like \"Emrakul, the Aeons Torn\" and \"Archon of Cruelty\" while disrupting the opponent's game plan. The mana base includes various lands to support the deck's color requirements."

The goal is to use cards like Entomb, Animate Dead, and Sylvan Library to put Worldgorger Dragon into the graveyard and then bring it back onto the battlefield using reanimation spells. Once Worldgorger Dragon enters the battlefield, it will flicker in and out, causing all lands to untap and giving you a large amount of mana. This mana can then be used to activate Atraxa's ability multiple times and generate a significant advantage over your opponent. The deck also includes disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Cabal Therapy to disrupt your opponent's game plan."

The deck focuses on playing fast and disrupting the opponent's game plan by utilizing cards like Chalice of the Void, Blood Moon, and Shatterskull Smashing to restrict their options. Additionally, the inclusion of Goblin Rabblemaster, Bonecrusher Giant, and Reckless Stormseeker provides a constant threat of damage, putting pressure on the opponent. The deck also benefits from acceleration with Simian Spirit Guide, Chrome Mox, and lands like City of Traitors and Ancient Tomb."
