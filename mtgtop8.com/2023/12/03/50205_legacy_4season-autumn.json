It utilizes the \"Canadian Threshold\" archetype, which combines blue for control elements with red for direct damage and creature aggression. The deck includes cards like Brainstorm, Daze, and Force of Will for disruption and protection, as well as Lightning Bolt and Delver of Secrets for damage. Dragon's Rage Channeler and Questing Druid provide additional threats, while Murktide Regent offers a bigger threat later in the game. It also utilizes land disruption with Wasteland to further control the opponent's resources."
