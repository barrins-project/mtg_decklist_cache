The key card in the deck is The One Ring, which provides additional control options and can ultimately win the game. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Jace, Wielder of Mysteries, as well as versatile removal spells like Supreme Verdict and Prismatic Ending. Additionally, the deck utilizes a mix of dual lands and fetchlands to ensure consistent mana production. Overall, the main strategy is to maintain control of the game while setting up for a win condition using The One Ring."
