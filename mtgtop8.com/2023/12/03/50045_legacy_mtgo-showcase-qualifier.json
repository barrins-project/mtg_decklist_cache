The deck also utilizes cards like Swords to Plowshares and Terminus for removal, and Brainstorm, Ponder, and Misty Rainforest for card manipulation and deck thinning. Additionally, the deck aims to create card advantage and gain life through Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. It also includes a mix of lands for color fixing and a few unique cards like Leyline Binding, Lórien Revealed, and Xander's Lounge."

The deck includes numerous card draw spells like Preordain and Impulse to dig through the deck, as well as counterspells like Force of Will and Daze to protect the combo. The mana base consists of various lands that provide colored mana and acceleration, such as Otawara, Soaring City and Ancient Tomb."
