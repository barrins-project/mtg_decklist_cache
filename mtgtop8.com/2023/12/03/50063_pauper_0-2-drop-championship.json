The deck aims to quickly ramp up its mana with Utopia Sprawl and Wild Growth while using Mwonvuli Acid-Moss and Thermokarst to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Skred provides removal, while Annoyed Altisaur and Boarding Party offer additional aggression. The inclusion of Jewel Thief adds a card draw aspect to the deck. The mana base consists of Snow-Covered lands to take advantage of the snow mechanics in the format."
