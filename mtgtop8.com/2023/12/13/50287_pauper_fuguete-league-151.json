It achieves this by utilizing efficient creatures like Glint Hawk, Thraben Inspector, and Kor Skyfisher to establish a quick board advantage. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Faerie Macabre and Unmake to disrupt opponent's strategies. Additionally, the deck uses Inspiring Overseer and Indoctrination Attendant to generate additional value and card advantage. The land base is focused on providing consistent mana sources while allowing for the inclusion of powerful spells and abilities."
