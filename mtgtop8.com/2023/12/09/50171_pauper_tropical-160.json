The deck focuses on sacrificing creatures and using those sacrifices to generate additional resources or deal damage. It also includes cards that can generate extra cards or provide protection against the opponent's spells. The deck is centered around the use of artifacts and spells from the Rakdos color combination, with a mix of creatures to provide a balance of offensive and defensive capabilities."
