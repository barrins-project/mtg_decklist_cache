It relies on creatures with abilities that punish the opponent for casting spells or gaining life, such as Eidolon of the Great Revel and Rampaging Ferocidon. The deck also includes powerful direct damage spells like Lightning Strike and Play with Fire to quickly deplete the opponent's life total. Additionally, the inclusion of powerful creatures like Hazoret the Fervent and Bonecrusher Giant ensures a strong board presence and constant pressure. The deck's mana base includes various lands that provide additional benefits and give flexibility in casting spells."

The deck also includes cards like Smuggler's Copter, Collected Company, and Chord of Calling to provide additional value and consistency. The lands in the deck are designed to provide access to all necessary colors of mana."
