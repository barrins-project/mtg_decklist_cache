The deck also includes countermagic and hand disruption spells like Surgical Extraction and Tasha's Hideous Laughter to further disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the goal is to mill the opponent out of cards and win through decking them."

This allows the player to gain immense value by casting multiple spells for free and overwhelming their opponent. The deck also includes cards like Dead / Gone and Fire / Ice to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, the inclusion of Crashing Footfalls allows the player to create a threatening board presence. The deck also features counterspells like Force of Negation, Mystical Dispute, and Subtlety, to protect their own game plan."
