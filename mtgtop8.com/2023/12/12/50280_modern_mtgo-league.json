Removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember help clear the way for the faeries to continue dominating the game.

The goal is to quickly equip these creatures with massive equipment, allowing them to become highly threatening and difficult to deal with. The deck also includes cards like Esper Sentinel and Spell Pierce to disrupt the opponent's plans and protect its own combo. Urza's Saga provides additional value by searching for supporting artifacts. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its explosive combo potential."
