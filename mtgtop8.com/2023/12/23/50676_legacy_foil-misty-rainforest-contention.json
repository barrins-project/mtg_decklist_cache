This is achieved by using cards like Entomb, Animate Dead, and Reanimate to quickly revive these creatures. The deck also utilizes disruption and discard spells like Thoughtseize and Grief to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own combo. The inclusion of Lotus Petal, Dark Ritual, and fetch lands allows for fast and efficient mana generation. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its high-powered creatures while disrupting their strategy."
