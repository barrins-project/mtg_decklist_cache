The deck utilizes the Aether Vial and Stoneforge Mystic package to efficiently deploy powerful equipment like Batterskull and Kaldra Compleat. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion provides additional value and card advantage. The mana base consists of various lands to support the deck's color requirements while also including utility lands like Karakas and Wasteland."

The deck utilizes cards like Minsc &amp; Boo, Timeless Heroes, Magus of the Moon, and Undermountain Adventurer to disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain control of the board. Additionally, it includes cards like Chalice of the Void and Thought-Knot Seer to hinder the opponent's plays. The deck also includes mana acceleration cards like Lotus Petal and Simian Spirit Guide to quickly cast its spells and establish dominance."
