The deck focuses on playing cheap creatures with low mana costs and then using auras like Sentinel's Eyes, Candy Trail, and All That Glitters to boost their stats. It also includes cards like Benevolent Blessing and Journey to Nowhere for removal and disruption. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient creatures and create a strong board presence early in the game."
