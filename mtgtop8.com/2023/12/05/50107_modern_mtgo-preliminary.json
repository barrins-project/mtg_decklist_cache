It uses cards like Hangarback Walker and Walking Ballista to generate counters and remove threats. The Ozolith and Zabaz, the Glimmerwasp help to transfer and utilize counters effectively. Urza's Saga and Patchwork Automaton provide additional support for the strategy. The deck also includes disruption with cards like Gemstone Caverns and Boseiju, Who Endures. Overall, the key concept of this deck is establishing a strong board presence and overwhelming the opponent with powerful, counter-focused creatures."
