The key to the combo is using cards like Wildgrowth Walker, Gilded Goose, Prosperous Innkeeper, and Voice of the Blessed to gain life and generate creatures. Return to the Ranks and Collected Company help bring back creatures from the graveyard while Chord of Calling allows for specific creatures to be searched for and put onto the battlefield. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Cenote Scout to further support the combo."

Bloodtithe Harvester and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker provide additional threats, while Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Archfiend of the Dross serve as powerful finishers. The deck primarily relies on black mana sources and has a strong focus on creature and removal spells."

This is supplemented by removal spells like Fatal Push and disruption through Thoughtseize. The deck also utilizes the card advantage from Smuggler's Copter and Castle Locthwain. The finishers of this deck are Spawn of Mayhem and Knight of the Ebon Legion, which can quickly deal significant damage and overpower opponents."
