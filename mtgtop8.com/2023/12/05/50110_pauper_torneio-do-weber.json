The main strategy revolves around maximizing card advantage and tempo by utilizing various ETB effects and card drawing abilities. The key is to establish a strong board presence early on with creatures like Squadron Hawk and Militia Bugler, while also controlling the opponent's threats with cards like Journey to Nowhere. Prismatic Strands and Ramosian Rally provide important combat tricks for protecting the board and pushing through damage. The deck also includes a small number of utility cards like Destroy Evil and Guardian of the Guildpact for added versatility."

The deck uses cards like Experimental Synthesizer and Implement of Combustion to generate additional value and card draw. Overall, the deck focuses on speed and efficiency to overwhelm the opponent and win the game quickly."
