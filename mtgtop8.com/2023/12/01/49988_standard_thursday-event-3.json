The deck focuses on aggressive play, utilizing cards that provide additional value when they enter the battlefield (such as Spellbook Vendor and Recruitment Officer) and creatures with low mana cost (like Hopeful Initiate and Adeline, Resplendent Cathar). Thalia, Guardian of Thraben disrupts the opponent's playing by increasing their spell costs, and cards like Virtue of Loyalty and Ossification provide additional buffs and ways to protect your creatures. The deck is supported by lands like Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire and Mishra's Foundry."
