The deck uses a combination of removal spells like Fatal Push and Drown in the Loch to deal with threats, while cards like Thoughtseize and Liliana, Death's Majesty disrupt the opponent's hand and graveyard. Additionally, the deck utilizes the companion mechanic with Yorion, Sky Nomad, allowing for additional value and card advantage. The deck aims to establish a dominant position and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful creatures and control elements."
