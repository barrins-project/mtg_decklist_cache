            "notes": "This Legacy 1 vs 1 deck focuses on the combo strategy of quickly reanimating powerful creatures from the graveyard. The key idea behind the deck is to use cards like Animate Dead, Reanimate, Exhume, and Entomb to bring creatures like Archon of Cruelty, Griselbrand, and Atraxa, Grand Unifier back onto the battlefield from the graveyard at a low cost. The deck also includes disruptive elements such as Thoughtseize and Grief to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck utilizes cards like Lotus Petal, Dark Ritual, and mana-fixing lands to ensure efficient and consistent plays."
