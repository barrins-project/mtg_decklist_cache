Gnaw to the Bone is included to gain life and prolong the game, while cards like Mire Triton and Stinkweed Imp provide additional graveyard filling. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with large creatures and grind them down with value-based plays."

The flickering also synergizes with cards like Cleansing Wildfire and Union of the Third Path to disrupt the opponent's resources and strategy."
