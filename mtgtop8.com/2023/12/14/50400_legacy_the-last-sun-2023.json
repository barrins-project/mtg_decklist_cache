The inclusion of cards like Force of Will and Force of Negation adds additional disruption and protection. With a mix of land and creature spells, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its aggressive, cascade-driven playstyle."

This allows the player to generate infinite mana by repeatedly sacrificing and re-casting the Diamond. This infinite mana can be used to activate the abilities of other cards in the deck, such as Walking Ballista and Patchwork Automaton, to deal damage to opponents. The deck also includes other artifacts and mana-generating cards to support the combo and disrupt opponents' strategies. The overall goal is to quickly assemble the combo and overwhelm opponents with powerful plays."

It utilizes a combination of disruption spells like Spell Pierce, Stifle, and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes removal spells such as Fatal Push and Murderous Cut to remove threats on the board. The key concept is to use powerful creatures like Murktide Regent and Orcish Bowmasters to quickly apply pressure and close out the game. Additionally, the deck utilizes a mix of cantrip spells like Brainstorm and Ponder for consistency in drawing cards and finding the necessary answers. Land destruction with Wasteland is also included to disrupt the opponent's mana base."
