Additionally, the deck includes cards like Relic of Progenitus and Wrenn's Resolve to disrupt the opponent's strategies and protect its own creatures. Overall, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total and win the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The deck revolves around using Prismatic Strands and Guardian of the Guildpact to protect yourself from damage. Brainstorm and Preordain are used to manipulate your deck and find the necessary cards. Squadron Hawk is used for card advantage and Counterspell for disruption. The deck also uses a variety of gates for mana fixing and to enable the ability of The Modern Age. Sacred Cat and Dawnbringer Cleric provide additional defense, while Basilisk Gate and Citadel Gate can remove threats. Overall, it aims to control the board and outlast the opponent."
