The deck includes cards such as Archaeomancer, Ephemerate, and Lórien Revealed to repeatedly blink creatures and spells, allowing for the reuse of powerful enter-the-battlefield abilities. This can lead to a steady stream of card draw, removal, and counterspells, ensuring consistency and control. The inclusion of Cleansing Wildfire and Cast into the Fire provides additional disruption and land destruction options. The deck also runs a mix of removal like Lightning Bolt and Skred to keep the opponent's board clear."
