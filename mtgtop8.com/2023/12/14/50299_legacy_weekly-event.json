The deck aims to quickly lock down the opponent's mana base with these hate cards while also dealing damage with the aggressive creatures. Additionally, the deck utilizes accelerants like Chrome Mox and Simian Spirit Guide to quickly deploy its threats and capitalize on its disruptive elements. Overall, the key concept of this deck is aggressive disruption through hate cards and fast creature deployment."
