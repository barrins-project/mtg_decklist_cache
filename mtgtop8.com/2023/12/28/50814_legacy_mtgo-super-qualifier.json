By using cards like Voltaic Key and Mox Opal, the deck aims to generate a large amount of mana quickly. Defense Grid helps protect the combo pieces while Karn, the Great Creator enables artifact tutoring and utility. The goal is to set up a loop using Paradox Engine and Mystic Forge, allowing the player to play cards from the top of their library, while using Urza's Saga to create powerful artifacts."

It utilizes a mix of efficient removal spells, such as Go for the Throat, Witherbloom Command, Fatal Push, and Murderous Cut, to eliminate threats. The deck also incorporates card selection and manipulation with spells like Ponder, Brainstorm, and LÃ³rien Revealed to ensure consistent draws and maximize its resources. Additionally, it employs disruptive elements like Daze and Force of Will to counter opponent's spells. The deck includes powerful creatures like Leovold, Emissary of Trest, Murktide Regent, and Orcish Bowmasters to dominate the board. Lastly, it has land destruction capabilities with Wasteland to further disrupt the opponent's mana base."
