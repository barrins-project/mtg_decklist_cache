            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to aggressively control the board and deal damage quickly. It utilizes a mix of powerful creatures with abilities that disrupt the opponent's strategy, like Faerie Dreamthief and Preacher of the Schism. The deck also includes removal spells like Cut Down to eliminate threats. Bitter Triumph is used to gain additional value from sacrificing creatures. The deck's mana base is built to support its aggressive playstyle, with a mix of lands that produce black and red mana and a few utility lands like Takenuma, Abandoned Mire and Sokenzan, Crucible of Defiance."
