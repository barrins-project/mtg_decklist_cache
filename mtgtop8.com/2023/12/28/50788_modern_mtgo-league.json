The deck aims to create a strong board presence with cards like Wrenn and Six, Teferi, Time Raveler, and Omnath, Locus of Creation. It also includes various removal options such as Solitude, Prismatic Ending, and Lightning Bolt to deal with threats. Leyline Binding helps to lock down opponent's cards, while Fable of the Mirror-Breaker provides card advantage. The deck also includes a diverse land base to support its color requirements and maintain flexibility in gameplay."
