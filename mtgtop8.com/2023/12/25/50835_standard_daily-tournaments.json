The key concept of the deck is to maintain board presence and control through removal spells like Go for the Throat and Cut Down, while also applying pressure with creatures like Glissa Sunslayer, Slogurk, the Overslime, and Rona, Herald of Invasion. Additionally, the deck includes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Perfected Mind and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse to generate card advantage and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base is diverse, allowing for flexibility in casting spells and accessing different types of mana."

It utilizes a mix of cheap creatures, removal spells, and disruptive effects to overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes a few high-impact creatures like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse to close out the game. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistent access to the necessary colors and to provide utility with various lands. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early, disrupt the opponent's strategy, and finish the game with powerful creatures."
