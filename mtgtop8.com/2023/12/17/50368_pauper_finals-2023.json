The deck aims to maintain a high tempo by playing cheap creatures such as Faerie Seer and Faerie Miscreant, while disrupting the opponent's plans with cards like Spellstutter Sprite and Counterspell. The deck also includes evasive creatures like Ninja of the Deep Hours to maximize damage output. Additionally, it has protection and counter options with Mutagenic Growth and Spell Pierce respectively. The deck is predominantly focused on utilizing Island cards for mana production."

By utilizing cards like Cast Down, Drown in Sorrow, and Journey to Nowhere, the deck aims to remove threats and disrupt opponents' strategies. The deck also focuses on card advantage and resilience with cards like Glint Hawk, Thraben Inspector, and Spare Supplies. The inclusion of Guardian of the Guildpact and Tithing Blade helps to protect the player while dealing continuous damage with Pestilence. Additionally, the deck includes lifegain options with Kabira Crossroads and Scoured Barrens to sustain itself."

The deck also includes protection spells like Karametra's Blessing and Emerge Unscathed to protect and enhance the creatures. The goal is to establish a strong early game presence and maintain pressure until the opponent is overwhelmed."
