The deck focuses on controlling the opponent's board state by countering their spells and removing their threats, while also drawing additional cards to maintain a strong hand and options. Key cards like Jace, the Perfected Mind and Memory Deluge provide additional card advantage and manipulation, allowing the player to stay ahead of the opponent in terms of resources. The deck also includes some land disruption with cards like Depopulate and Demolition Field to further hinder the opponent's development."
