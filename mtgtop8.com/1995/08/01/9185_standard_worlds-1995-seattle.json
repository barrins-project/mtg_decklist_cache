It aims to quickly build up a board presence by playing efficient mana dorks like Fyndhorn Elves and Llanowar Elves, while also utilizing mana disruption with Strip Mine and Armageddon. The deck includes powerful threats like Lhurgoyf, Elvish Archers, and Force of Nature to quickly damage the opponent's life total. The inclusion of cards like Giant Growth, Swords to Plowshares, Whirling Dervish, and Woolly Spider provide additional versatility and resilience against various threats."
