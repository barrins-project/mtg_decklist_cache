            "notes": "The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's resources and controlling the board with cards like Strip Mine, Stone Rain, and Paralyze. It also utilizes efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Incinerate to eliminate threats. The deck aims to quickly ramp up mana with Fellwar Stone and Dark Ritual to cast powerful threats like Orgg and close out the game with direct damage spells like Fireball. The inclusion of Black Vise and Foul Familiar adds additional pressure on the opponent and creates a challenging environment for them to navigate."
