With a focus on speed and tempo, this deck aims to finish the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize or mount a comeback."

By flooding the board with low-cost creatures like Emberheart Challenger and Hired Claw, and supplementing them with damage-dealing spells like Burst Lightning and Monstrous Rage, the goal is to pressure the opponent early and finish the game before they can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Magebane Lizard and Self-Destruct also helps to disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain tempo. With a strong mana base and various ways to deal damage, this deck aims to win quickly and decisively."

Opt and Sleight of Hand help to dig through the deck for key cards, while Torch the Tower and Monstrous Rage provide removal and additional damage. Vivi Ornitier adds an extra layer of aggression, making it difficult for opponents to stabilize. The mana base allows for smooth casting of spells and creatures."

The deck aims to control the board with efficient removal spells and then finish off the opponent with powerful attacks. Additionally, the mana base is optimized for casting spells of both red and blue colors consistently. This deck focuses on tempo and efficiency to apply pressure and secure victories in a fast-paced 1 vs 1 format."

By utilizing a combination of creatures with haste, card draw, and burn spells, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize. The deck also includes some card draw and recursion to ensure a consistent flow of threats and ways to finish off the opponent."
