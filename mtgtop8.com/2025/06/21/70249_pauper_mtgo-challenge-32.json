By constantly putting pressure on the opponent with aggressive creatures like Myr Enforcer and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The deck also includes some removal options like Krark-Clan Shaman and Nihil Spellbomb to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the deck aims to quickly establish a dominant board presence and close out the game efficiently."

Gnaw to the Bone provides lifegain to survive aggressive opponents, and Malevolent Rumble can clear the board of creatures. The Conduit Pylons and Generous Ent help ramp up mana production for casting larger spells."
