Faithless Looting helps to dig for key cards while Alms of the Vein and Vampire's Kiss provide life gain to help stabilize against aggressive opponents. Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery provide additional reach and card advantage to keep up the pressure. The deck is designed to be streamlined and aggressive, aiming to close out games quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
