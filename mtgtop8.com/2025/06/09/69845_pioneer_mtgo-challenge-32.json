Key cards like Emberheart Challenger, Heartfire Hero, and Kumano Faces Kakkazan provide consistent damage output, while cards like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike allow for direct damage to the opponent or removal of key threats. The deck aims to close out games quickly before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
