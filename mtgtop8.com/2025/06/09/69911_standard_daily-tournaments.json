The inclusion of powerful creatures like Dark Confidant and Cecil, Dark Knight, along with support from cards like Go for the Throat and Liliana of the Veil, allows for a relentless and punishing playstyle that can quickly end games in the player's favor. The deck's synergy between its creatures and spells creates a fast and dangerous mono black aggro strategy."
