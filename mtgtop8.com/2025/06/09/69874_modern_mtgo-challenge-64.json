By leveraging a mix of removal, counterspells, and hand disruption, this deck aims to control the game's tempo and grind out a win through superior card advantage and efficient threats. The inclusion of Leyline cards and a variety of color-producing lands allows for flexibility in casting powerful spells and reacting to a wide range of opposing strategies."
