By playing creatures like Martyr of Sands and Ranger-Captain of Eos, you can quickly gain life and search for key cards in your deck. Cards like Solitude and Prismatic Ending help deal with threats on the board, while Abiding Grace and Temporary Lockdown help maintain control over the game. The goal is to outlast your opponent by gaining a significant amount of life and overwhelming them with efficient creatures and removal spells."
