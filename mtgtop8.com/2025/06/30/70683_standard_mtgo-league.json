By using low-cost spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike to control the board and deal damage, along with cards like Monstrous Rage to pump up your creatures, the goal is to quickly deplete your opponent's life total before they can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Magebane Lizard and Soulstone Sanctuary helps to protect your creatures and maintain pressure on your opponent."
