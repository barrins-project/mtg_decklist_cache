The deck utilizes cards like Solitude, Skyclave Apparition, and Path to Exile to remove threats from the opponent's board while also taking advantage of Martyr of Sands and Abiding Grace to gain life. The deck also includes tools like Ranger-Captain of Eos and Temporary Lockdown to further disrupt the opponent's strategy, creating a strong aggro presence that can overwhelm opponents while staying resilient with life gain options."
