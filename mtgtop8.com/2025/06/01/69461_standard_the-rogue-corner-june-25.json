By continuously disrupting your opponent's game plan with counterspells like Spell Pierce and bounce spells like Into the Flood Maw and Aetherize, while drawing cards with Flow of Knowledge and Opt, you can slowly gain advantage and outvalue your opponent. Eddymurk Crab and Tolarian Terror provide additional ways to control the board and protect your life total, making it difficult for your opponent to gain traction and ultimately allowing you to win through attrition."
