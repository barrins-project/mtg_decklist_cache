The deck also includes creatures that provide additional value such as creating tokens or returning cards from the graveyard. Additionally, the deck utilizes a snow mana base to support cards that require snow permanents. Overall, the deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan while gradually building up its own resources to secure victory."
