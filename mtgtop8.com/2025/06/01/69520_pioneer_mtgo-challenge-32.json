It also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Go for the Throat to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck aims to apply pressure early in the game and maintain that pressure to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The inclusion of Thoughtseize and Duress helps to disrupt the opponent's hand and prevent them from mounting a counterattack."
