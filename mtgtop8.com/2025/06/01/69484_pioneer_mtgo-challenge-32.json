By leveraging a companion like Yorion, Sky Nomad for additional value and running cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Memory Deluge, the deck aims to outvalue opponents in the long game. It also utilizes land destruction with Field of Ruin and versatile answers like Dovin's Veto and Supreme Verdict to handle a variety of threats. With a focus on controlling the board and card advantage, it aims to outgrind opponents to victory."
