            "notes": "The deck focuses on using artifact creatures and token generators to quickly build a board presence that can overwhelm the opponent. By playing cards that restrict the opponent's ability to cast multiple spells per turn, along with disruptive creatures like Ethersworn Canonist and Esper Sentinel, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while continuing to apply pressure. Winota, Joiner of Forces serves as a powerful finisher, allowing the player to potentially put multiple threats onto the battlefield in a single turn. The deck's mana base is designed to support its aggressive strategy while also providing some disruption with cards like Karakas."
