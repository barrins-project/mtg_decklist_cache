By utilizing cards like Myr Enforcer, Galvanic Blast, and Krark-Clan Shaman, the deck can quickly deal damage to the opponent while controlling the board with cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Reckoner's Bargain. The deck also includes card draw options like Thoughtcast and Ichor Wellspring to maintain card advantage. Additionally, Seat of the Synod and Vault of Whispers provide additional mana sources to cast multiple spells in a turn."
