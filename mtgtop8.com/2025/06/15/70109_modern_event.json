It aims to apply pressure early in the game and maintain board control using cards like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Blood Moon. Additionally, it utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Ajani, Nactl Pariah and high-impact enchantments like Static Prison to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also includes cards like Galvanic Discharge for direct damage and Goblin Bombardment for additional reach. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy with a mix of fetchlands and dual lands."
