This allows the player to play a defensive game with counterspells and removal while setting up powerful card advantage engines like Mulldrifter and Mystical Teachings. The deck aims to stall the opponent while building up resources and eventually overwhelming them with card advantage and powerful spells. It utilizes a mix of control elements, card draw, and recursion to outlast and outvalue the opponent in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
