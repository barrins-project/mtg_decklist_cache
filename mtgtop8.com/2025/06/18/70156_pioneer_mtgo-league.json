It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy, utilizing cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Thalia's Lieutenant to disrupt the opponent's game plan while growing its own army of creatures. The inclusion of cards like Declaration in Stone provides removal options, while Mox Amber helps accelerate mana production. The deck's mana base includes a mix of color-producing lands and utility lands to support its aggressive game plan."
