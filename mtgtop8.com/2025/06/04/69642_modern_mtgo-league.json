Additionally, the inclusion of Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student provides card advantage and selection, while Orcish Bowmasters and Psychic Frog offer additional ways to control the board. The deck's mana base is designed to support a variety of colored spells while maintaining consistency in casting them."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with counterspells like Chalice of the Void and powerful removal like Dismember, while generating card advantage with cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, the Eye of the Storms. By assembling the UrzaTron pieces quickly, the deck can overwhelm opponents with large threats and efficiently control the game until victory."
