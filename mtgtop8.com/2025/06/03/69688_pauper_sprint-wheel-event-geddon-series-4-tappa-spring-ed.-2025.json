            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to utilize creatures with high toughness, such as Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement, to generate large amounts of mana. The key strategy is to play walls that can tap for mana, while also including cards like Freed from the Real and Galvanic Alchemist to untap creatures and generate infinite mana. This allows the player to cast powerful spells like Reaping the Graves or Third Path Savant to win the game. Additionally, Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to consistently find combo pieces and maintain card advantage."
