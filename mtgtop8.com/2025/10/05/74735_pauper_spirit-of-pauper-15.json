It utilizes a combination of cycling creatures, mana acceleration with rituals and Lotus Petal, and graveyard recursion to overwhelm the opponent with a high number of creatures. The key strategy is to efficiently cycle through the deck, generate mana, and cast Reaping the Graves to reanimate multiple creatures in a single turn for a devastating combo."
