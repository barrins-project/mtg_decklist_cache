The deck also includes a mix of creatures with disruptive abilities, such as Spellstutter Sprite and Ninja of the Deep Hours, to provide additional pressure and tempo advantage. Overall, the goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while establishing your own win condition through efficient use of resources and strategic decision-making."
