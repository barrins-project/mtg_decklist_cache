Card draw and filtering spells like Brainstorm, Thought Scour, and Ponder help maintain consistency and tempo. Deem Inferior and Lórien Revealed provide additional synergy with the deck's strategy. Sleep of the Dead can help lock down opponents in the late game. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast-paced aggro strategy backed up by disruptive spells."
