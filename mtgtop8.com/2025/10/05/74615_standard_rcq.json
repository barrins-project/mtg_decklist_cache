The deck focuses on playing efficient creatures like Ghalta, Primal Hunger and Regal Imperiosaur, supported by ramp creatures like Llanowar Elves to quickly get them onto the battlefield. Primal Might and Abrade provide removal and combat tricks to help clear the way for attacks, while cards like Triumphant Chomp and Scytheclaw Raptor give additional combat prowess. The deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence and defeat the opponent before they can stabilize."
