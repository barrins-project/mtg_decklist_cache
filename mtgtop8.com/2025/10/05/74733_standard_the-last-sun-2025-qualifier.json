By utilizing cards like Steamcore Scholar, Marauding Mako, and Fear of Missing Out, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on. Additionally, cards like Agatha's Soul Cauldron and Winternight Stories provide synergy and card advantage, while Quantum Riddler and Vivi Ornitier offer additional utility and disruption. The deck aims to control the board and push through damage efficiently, with a mix of creatures and spells to keep the opponent on their toes."
