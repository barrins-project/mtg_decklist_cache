By playing aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Dragon's Rage Channeler, along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Dart, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and close out the game before the opponent can establish a strong board presence. Mishra's Bauble and Preordain provide card selection and card advantage, while cards like Mutagenic Growth and Violent Urge can help push through damage or remove blockers. Overall, the strategy of this deck is to be fast and relentless in dealing damage to secure the win."
