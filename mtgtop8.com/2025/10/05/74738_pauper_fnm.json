Thought Scour and Mental Note help to fuel the graveyard for cards like Cryptic Serpent, while Lórien Revealed and Deem Inferior provide additional buffs for our creatures. With a focus on tempo and disruption, this deck aims to maintain control of the game while applying pressure with its aggressive creatures and spell suite."
