Back to Basics is utilized to punish opponents relying heavily on non-basic lands, while Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student provides card advantage and Thundertrap Trainer helps to lock down the opponent's creatures. The deck is designed to control the pace of the game, answer threats efficiently, and ultimately outvalue the opponent through card advantage and efficient removal."
