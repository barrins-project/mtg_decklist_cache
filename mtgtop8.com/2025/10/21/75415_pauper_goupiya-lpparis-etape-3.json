By efficiently using cards like Lightning Bolt, Fireblast, and Fiery Temper, along with creatures like Guttersnipe and Kessig Flamebreather, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and often. The inclusion of cards like Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery provide additional ways to maintain card advantage while dealing damage, leading to a fast-paced and explosive playstyle."
