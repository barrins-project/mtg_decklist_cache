By combining aggro strategies with Boros colors, the deck can efficiently deal damage while also disrupting the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of bounce lands and artifacts like Navigator's Compass and Experimental Synthesizer allows for mana fixing and extra card advantage. This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats while controlling the board through removal spells and combat tricks."
