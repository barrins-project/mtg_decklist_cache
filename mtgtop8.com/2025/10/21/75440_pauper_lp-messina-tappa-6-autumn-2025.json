            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and direct damage spells. By efficiently utilizing low-cost creatures and burn spells, the deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent while also having reach to finish off the game. The inclusion of cheap artifacts and efficient spells allows for quick pacing and continuous threats to keep the opponent on the defensive. The synergy between creatures and burn spells creates a fast-paced, high-damage output strategy that aims to close out the game as quickly as possible."
