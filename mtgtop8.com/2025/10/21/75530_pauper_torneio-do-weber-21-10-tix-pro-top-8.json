By utilizing efficient creatures like Troll of Khazad-dûm and Writhing Chrysalis alongside cards like Fanatical Offering and Pulse of Murasa, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating incremental advantage. The inclusion of Ichor Wellspring and Lembas also ensures that the deck can maintain card advantage and keep up with the opponent's threats. The combination of Golgari and Jund colors allows for a versatile and resilient control strategy."
