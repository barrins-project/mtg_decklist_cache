By efficiently using low-cost creatures and spells like Sneaky Snacker and Lightning Bolt, the deck can apply pressure early in the game. Faithless Looting helps to filter through the deck for more burn spells, while cards like Fireblast can deliver a final blow to the opponent. Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery provide additional reach and card advantage to maintain the aggressive strategy. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a relentless barrage of damage."
