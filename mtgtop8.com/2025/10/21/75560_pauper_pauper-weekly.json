            "notes": "This deck focuses on using fast mana ramp cards like Llanowar Elves and Fyndhorn Elves to quickly play out a board full of powerful elves like Timberwatch Elf and Nyxborn Hydra. Quirion Ranger and Priest of Titania help generate even more mana, while Lead the Stampede and Winding Way ensure a constant flow of creatures onto the battlefield. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of elves and use cards like Timberwatch Elf to pump them up for a quick victory."

Augur of Bolas helps to dig for key spells, while Lightning Bolt and Skred offer efficient removal options. The use of Snow-Covered lands allows for maximum synergy with Skred, while the inclusion of card draw spells like Brainstorm, Preordain, and Frantic Inventory ensures the deck can consistently find answers and threats. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent through careful resource management and strategic play."
