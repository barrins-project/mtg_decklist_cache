With a focus on speed and aggression, this Aggro - Weenie White deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and often, forcing them to react or risk being overrun."

The deck focuses on generating value through card draw and recurring creatures like Myr Retriever, while also dealing damage with Golem Foundry and Eviscerator's Insight. The inclusion of Ashnod's Altar provides additional mana acceleration and combo potential. Weather the Storm and Malevolent Rumble help to control the board and protect against aggressive strategies. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent in a Pauper 1 vs 1 matchup."
