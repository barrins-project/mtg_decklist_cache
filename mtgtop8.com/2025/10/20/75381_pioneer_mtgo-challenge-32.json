Quantum Riddler and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse provide powerful threats on the board, while Ledger Shredder helps with card advantage. The land base is designed to support the deck's color requirements while also enabling potential graveyard interactions."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressive play using Rakdos colors, employing powerful creatures and removal spells to quickly overwhelm the opponent. The deck utilizes cards like Bloodtithe Harvester, Sheoldred, the Apocalypse, and Mutavault to apply pressure, while also including removal spells like Fatal Push and Go for the Throat to deal with threats. Thoughtseize and Duress help disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and Fear of Missing Out provide additional ways to close out the game quickly. Overall, the deck aims to win through a combination of early aggression and disruption."
