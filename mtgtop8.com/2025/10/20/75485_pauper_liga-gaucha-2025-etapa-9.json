By overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of weenies, this aggro deck aims to deal consistent damage each turn and pressure the opponent into making suboptimal plays. The inclusion of card draw and protection spells ensures the deck can maintain momentum and recover from board wipes or removal spells. The synergy between creatures such as Squadron Hawk and Battle Screech allows for efficient token generation and constant pressure on the opponent."
