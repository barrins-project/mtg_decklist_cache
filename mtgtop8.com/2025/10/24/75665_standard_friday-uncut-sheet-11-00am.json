Supporting cards like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike help to clear the way for attacks, while Nova Hellkite and Razorkin Needlehead offer strong finishers. Rockface Village and Soulstone Sanctuary provide additional support and mana sources. The strategy is to apply pressure constantly and force the opponent to react, ultimately winning the game through a combination of creature damage and direct burn spells."
