Faithless Looting and Grab the Prize help to dig for the needed cards, while Highway Robbery provides additional reach. The deck aims to establish early pressure and maintain a relentless assault to overwhelm the opponent before they are able to stabilize. With a low mana curve and efficient threats, it looks to end the game quickly through aggressive tactics."
