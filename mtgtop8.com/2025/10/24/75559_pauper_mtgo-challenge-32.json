The Golgari / Jund Garden archetype utilizes cards like Pulse of Murasa to gain life and recur key creatures, while also running cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Snuff Out for removal. The deck also includes cards like Fanatical Offering and Reckoner's Bargain for additional value. The inclusion of Khalni Garden and other land cards helps to generate mana and provide additional creatures for defense. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and secure victory through attrition."
