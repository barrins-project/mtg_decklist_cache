Cards like Profit's Eidetic Memory and Multiversal Passage provide card advantage, while Quantum Riddler and Winternight Stories offer ways to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain tempo throughout the game, finishing off the opponent with powerful creatures like Marauding Mako and Vivi Ornitier."
