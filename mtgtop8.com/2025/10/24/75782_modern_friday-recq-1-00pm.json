By milling opponents' cards, players can trigger powerful effects like Visions of Beyond and Jace, the Perfected Mind, ultimately leading to victory by decking out the opponent. The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and board control cards like Field of Ruin to maintain control, making it a deadly combination of milling and control elements."
