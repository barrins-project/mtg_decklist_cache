Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student provide card advantage and recursion, while Kappa Cannoneer and Pinnacle Emissary serve as aggressive threats. The deck also includes disruption elements like Engineered Explosives and Tormod's Crypt to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells in a fast-paced game."
