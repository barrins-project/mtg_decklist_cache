Cards like Callous Sell-Sword and Emberheart Challenger provide early aggression, while Stadium Headliner and Dreadmaw's Ire offer additional damage and disruption. The deck also includes spells like Turn Inside Out and Full Bore to finish off the opponent or clear obstacles from the board. Leyline of Resonance can provide additional reach and damage, allowing the deck to close out games quickly."

It focuses on disrupting your opponent's strategy while building up your own resources. Cards like Day of Judgment and Seam Rip provide board control, while Consult the Star Charts and Meticulous Archive help you dig deeper into your deck. Elspeth, Storm Slayer and Marang River Regent offer win conditions, while Overlord of the Mistmoors and Overlord of the Floodpits provide additional control options. The goal is to outlast your opponent and secure victory through careful resource management and strategic plays."
