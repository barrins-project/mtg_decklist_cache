The companion, Kaheera, provides additional synergy and support for the deck's creatures. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure access to multiple colors and includes utility lands to further enhance the deck's control elements. The goal is to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent, ultimately leading to victory through strategic play and resource management."
