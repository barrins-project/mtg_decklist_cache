Augur of Bolas and Murmuring Mystic provide card advantage and board presence, while Skred and Tolarian Terror deal with threats efficiently. Thorn of the Black Rose and Lórien Revealed generate card advantage, and the singleton creatures provide additional utility. The mana base is optimized for consistency and provides access to a variety of colors for different spells. Overall, this deck aims to outlast opponents and win through incremental advantage."
