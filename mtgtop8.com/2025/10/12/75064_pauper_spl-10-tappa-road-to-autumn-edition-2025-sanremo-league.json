The deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on with cards like Myr Enforcer and Gearseeker Serpent while utilizing efficient removal like Galvanic Blast and Krark-Clan Shaman to control the opponent's board. The deck also includes card draw and synergy with artifacts to maintain momentum and pressure. It ultimately seeks to outpace the opponent and finish them off with a combination of creatures and direct damage spells."
