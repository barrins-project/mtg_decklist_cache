            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly filling the graveyard with creature cards and then using cards like Dread Return to bring them back onto the battlefield. The key strategy is to outvalue the opponent by reanimating powerful creatures for a low cost, while also gaining life to stay alive with cards like Gnaw to the Bone. The deck also includes some land cards that can be sacrificed to generate mana for additional plays, making it a versatile and resilient combo-reanimator archetype."
