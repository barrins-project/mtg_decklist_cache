Jewel Thief and Eldrazi Repurposer provide additional value while generating tokens, and Writhing Chrysalis can potentially turn a small creature into a larger threat. The deck also includes removal spells like Malevolent Rumble and Horrific Assault to deal with opposing threats. Overall, this Mono Green Aggro deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with an aggressive creature-based strategy."
