By utilizing cards like Agatha's Soul Cauldron, Marauding Mako, and Proft's Eidetic Memory, the player can apply pressure early in the game. Additional utility comes from cards like Riverpyre Verge and Vivi Ornitier, while removal spells like Abrade and Obliterating Bolt help control the board. The deck also includes card draw and mana fixing with Steamcore Scholar and Quantum Riddler, allowing for card advantage and smooth mana curves throughout the game."
