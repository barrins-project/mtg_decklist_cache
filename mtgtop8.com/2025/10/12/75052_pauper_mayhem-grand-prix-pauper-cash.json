Sunscape Familiar and God-Pharoah's Faithful help with mana efficiency, while cards like Cryogen Relic and Lórien Revealed provide additional ways to draw cards and gain incremental advantages. The deck aims to outvalue opponents over time while maintaining control of the game."

The deck also includes cards like Timberwatch Elf and Nyxborn Hydra to pump up the creatures and deal massive amounts of damage quickly. Winding Way and Lead the Stampede help to refill the hand with more creatures, ensuring a consistent stream of threats. Overall, the goal is to build a board presence quickly and keep the pressure on the opponent."
