By combining cards like Bloodtithe Harvester, Cauldron Familiar, Mayhem Devil, Witch's Oven, and Deadly Dispute, the deck aims to generate value from sacrificing creatures and tokens while disrupting the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of cards like Fatal Push and Scavenger's Talent helps to remove threats from the opponent's side of the battlefield, allowing the deck to maintain pressure and close out games quickly."
