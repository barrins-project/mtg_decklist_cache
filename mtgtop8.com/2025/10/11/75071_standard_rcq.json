It includes cards that disrupt the opponent's strategy and deal direct damage, while also incorporating cards that provide benefits when your creatures deal damage. The mana base is optimized for Orzhov colors, featuring lands that produce both white and black mana. The creatures in the deck are strong attackers, with the ability to generate card advantage or hinder the opponent's plans. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and maintain board presence."
