By using cards like Voldaren Epicure, Kessig Flamebreather, and Guttersnipe, along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast, the goal is to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. Cards like Lava Dart and Fiery Temper provide additional reach and removal, while Faithless Looting helps with card selection. Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery provide additional resources and potential card advantage. The strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and direct damage spells."
