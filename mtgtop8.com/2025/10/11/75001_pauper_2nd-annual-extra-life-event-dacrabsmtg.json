The inclusion of cards like Ephemerate and Ghostly Flicker allows for repeatable value plays with creatures like Archaeomancer and Murmuring Mystic, while cards like Snap and Foil provide disruption for the opponent's strategy. Through careful resource management and card selection, the deck aims to out-grind opponents for the win."
