By constantly dealing damage to your opponent's creatures and directly to their life total, you can quickly bring their life total down to zero. The key strategy is to maintain pressure with low-cost creatures and spells while using burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast to finish off your opponent. Additionally, cards like Grab the Prize offer card advantage and further help you maintain board control while staying on the offensive."
