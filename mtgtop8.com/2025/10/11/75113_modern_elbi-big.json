The deck also includes cards like Mutagenic Growth and Violent Urge to pump up creatures and push through damage. Expressive Iteration and Mishra's Bauble provide card selection and card advantage, allowing the deck to maintain pressure while staying efficient. The deck aims to win the game quickly through a combination of creature damage and direct burn spells."
