Fear of Missing Out and Marauding Mako provide early threats, while Steamcore Scholar and Vivi Ornitier help maintain pressure. Spells like Abrade and Torch the Tower can deal with opposing threats, while Winternight Stories and Agatha's Soul Cauldron provide card advantage. The combination of creatures and burn spells aims to win the game quickly, before the opponent can stabilize. The deck also includes some control elements like Quantum Riddler and Tersa Lightshatter to disrupt the opponent's strategy."
