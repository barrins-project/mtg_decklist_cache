It includes a mix of burn spells, card draw, and powerful creatures with abilities that can help close out the game. By controlling the board and keeping up pressure, it aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize or mount a strong defense. The deck's strength lies in its ability to consistently apply pressure while still having access to card advantage and removal spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
