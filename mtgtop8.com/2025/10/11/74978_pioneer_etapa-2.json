The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and powerful spells, quickly closing out the game before they have a chance to stabilize."

The deck also utilizes cards like Giada, Font of Hope and Skyclave Apparition for both lifegain and removal, while Collected Company helps to find key creatures. The inclusion of Kayla's Reconstruction allows for recursion of important creatures, creating a relentless and aggressive strategy aimed at overwhelming the opponent."
