By playing aggressive creatures like Voldaren Epicure and Kitchen Imp, along with efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fiery Temper, this deck aims to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Vampire's Kiss and Alms of the Vein provide incidental lifegain to help sustain the player during the aggressive onslaught. With a mix of creatures, burn spells, and lifegain, this deck looks to win the game swiftly and decisively."
