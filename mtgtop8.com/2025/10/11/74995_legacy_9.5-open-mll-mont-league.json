Chalice of the Void is used to shut down opposing spells, while cards like Fury and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker provide removal and combat tricks. The deck also includes protection for its creatures with cards like Cavern of Souls and Seasoned Dungeoneer."

The deck combines traditional control elements such as Force of Will and Brainstorm with more unconventional cards like Flame of Anor and Dress Down to create a versatile and unpredictable game plan. By controlling the pace of the game and out-valuing the opponent, this deck aims to grind out victories through careful resource management and strategic decision-making."
