The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while building up its own resources and gradually gaining an advantage. With a mix of creatures, spells, and lands that generate multiple types of mana, the deck seeks to outmaneuver the opponent and secure victory through careful planning and resource management. Additionally, the inclusion of snow-covered lands allows for additional synergies and flexibility in the deck's mana base."
