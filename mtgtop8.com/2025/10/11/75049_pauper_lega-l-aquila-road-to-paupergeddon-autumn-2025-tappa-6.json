The deck includes cards that facilitate graveyard filling such as Satyr Wayfinder and Stinkweed Imp, as well as cards like Dread Return and Writhing Chrysalis that allow for easy reanimation. The combo of sacrificing creatures and using Dread Return to bring back powerful creatures like Lotleth Giant or Oliphaunt can quickly swing the game in your favor. With cards like Molten Gatekeeper and Malevolent Rumble for removal and disruption, this deck aims for a swift victory through explosive graveyard synergies."
