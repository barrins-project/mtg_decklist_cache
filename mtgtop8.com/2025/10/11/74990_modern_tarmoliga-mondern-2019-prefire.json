The goal is to constantly apply pressure and force the opponent to react defensively, while efficiently using burn spells to finish them off. The deck aims to win quickly before the opponent can stabilize or set up their own game plan. The low mana curve allows for fast plays and consistent damage output, while the land base provides versatility and access to different colors of mana for the burn spells."
