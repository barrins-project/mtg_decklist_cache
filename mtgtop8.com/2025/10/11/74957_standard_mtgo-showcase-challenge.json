Cards like Screaming Nemesis and Burnout Bashtronaut provide early aggression, while spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike offer additional reach to finish off the opponent. The deck also includes a few defensive options like Shock and Soulstone Sanctuary to protect its creatures and maintain board presence."
