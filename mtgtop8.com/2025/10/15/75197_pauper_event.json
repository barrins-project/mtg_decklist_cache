With a mix of removal spells, sacrifice outlets, and powerful artifacts, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a constant stream of threats. By utilizing a combination of aggressive creatures and disruption, this deck aims to apply pressure early on and maintain control of the game by continually recycling resources from the graveyard. The synergy between sacrificing creatures for benefit and manipulating the graveyard for advantage is the core strategy of this deck."
