It also utilizes artifacts to control the board through various effects like sacrificing creatures and drawing cards. The deck aims to stabilize in the early game with cheap artifacts and then overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Fangren Marauder and Pactdoll Terror. The synergy between the artifact creatures and sacrifice effects creates a resilient board presence while keeping the opponent's resources in check."
