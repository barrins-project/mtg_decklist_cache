By utilizing cards that generate extra value from artifacts, such as Ichor Wellspring and Refurbished Familiar, and combining them with powerful payoff cards like Myr Enforcer and Galvanic Blast, this deck can quickly build a threatening board presence. The inclusion of Krark-Clan Shaman and Gearseeker Serpent adds additional removal and threats to push through damage efficiently. The mana base is optimized to support the heavy artifact theme and ensure consistent aggression."

Additionally, cards like Lava Dart and Grab the Prize provide additional reach and versatility in dealing damage, while Faithless Looting helps to filter through the deck and find key cards quickly."
