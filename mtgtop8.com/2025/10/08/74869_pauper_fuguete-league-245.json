By utilizing a variety of enchantments such as Ethereal Armor and Sentinel's Eyes to boost their power and toughness, the deck aims to quickly build a formidable board presence. Additionally, cards like Emerge Unscathed and Solid Footing provide ways to protect and enhance these creatures further. The overall goal is to maintain pressure on the opponent and secure victory through efficient creature combat and enchantment synergy."
