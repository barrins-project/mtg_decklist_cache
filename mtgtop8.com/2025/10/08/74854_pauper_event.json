By utilizing cards like Delver of Secrets, Cryptic Serpent, and Tolarian Terror, the deck aims to establish control early on and maintain pressure throughout the game. The deck includes a mix of counterspells, card draw, and disruptive spells to keep the opponent on the back foot. With a focus on tempo and efficiency, the deck aims to quickly outpace the opponent and secure victory through a combination of aggression and control."
