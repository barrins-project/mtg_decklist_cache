Once the graveyard is stocked, the deck utilizes cards like Exhume and Dread Return to bring these creatures back into play for a massive, game-winning turn. The deck also includes cards like Sneaky Snacker and Oliphaunt to provide early game presence and disruption. Bojuka Bog and Nihil Spellbomb are included as graveyard hate options to disrupt opponent strategies."
