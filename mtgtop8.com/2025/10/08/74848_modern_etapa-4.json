The deck aims to apply early pressure through cards like Mutagenic Growth, Lava Dart, and Lightning Bolt, while generating card advantage with Mishra's Bauble and Expressive Iteration. The deck also includes lands like Steam Vents, Wooded Foothills, and Fiery Islet to ensure consistent mana production for quick and efficient plays."
