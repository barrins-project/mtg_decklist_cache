By utilizing low-cost creatures like Sneaky Snacker and Kitchen Imp, along with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Fiery Temper, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total. Faithless Looting and Vampire's Kiss help with card advantage and life gain, while cards like Grab the Prize and Alms of the Vein provide additional ways to deal damage. The land base includes a mix of Mountains, Swamps, and dual lands to ensure the deck can cast its spells efficiently."
