By playing efficient threats and combining them with burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt, this red aggro deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and end the game as quickly as possible. The inclusion of cards like Reckless Impulse and Rally at the Hornburg help keep the pressure on by allowing for quick card draw and additional creature buffs."
