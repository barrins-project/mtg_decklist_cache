By utilizing low-cost cards like Lightning Bolt and Lava Dart, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Cards like Guttersnipe and Sneaky Snacker provide additional damage triggers while Grab the Prize helps to generate card advantage. With a focus on fast-paced aggression and consistent damage output, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
