It aims to maintain board control and card advantage through a combination of counterspells, removal, and card draw spells. Additionally, it utilizes snow-covered lands to leverage Skred's potential, while also having access to various utility lands for additional flexibility in gameplan. Overall, the deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy while gradually building up its own advantageous position for a strong finish."
