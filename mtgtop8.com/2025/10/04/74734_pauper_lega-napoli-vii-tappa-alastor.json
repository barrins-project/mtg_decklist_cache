By utilizing mana-efficient spells like Galvanic Blast and sacrificing artifacts with cards like Fanatical Offering and Makeshift Munitions, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures and burn spells. The variety of artifact lands and mana producers allows for consistent mana generation, while cards like Nihil Spellbomb provide disruption against graveyard-based strategies."
