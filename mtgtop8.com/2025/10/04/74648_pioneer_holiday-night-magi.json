Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Thalia's Lieutenant help to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Dauntless Bodyguard and Adeline, Resplendent Cathar provide strong attacking options. The deck also includes utility cards like Reflector Mage and Persistent Petitioners to control the battlefield or disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to the necessary colors for casting spells. Ultimately, the goal is to quickly build a threatening board presence and close out the game."
