By utilizing efficient creatures like Kor Skyfisher and Thraben Inspector, along with spells like Battle Screech and Guardians' Pledge, the deck aims to maintain board presence and apply pressure early on. Additionally, cards like Prismatic Strands and You're Not Alone provide protection and resilience against removal spells and board wipes, allowing the deck to outlast opponents and secure victory through aggressive tactics."
