Lórien Revealed and Ideas Unbound also help to draw through the deck quickly to find key pieces. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and finish the game in one explosive turn."

By utilizing cards like Journey to Nowhere and Lightning Bolt, as well as creatures like Glint Hawk and Kor Skyfisher, the deck aims to control the board and limit the opponent's options. The inclusion of cards like Melded Moxite and Cryogen Relic help to generate mana and provide additional resources to maintain control. The deck also includes ways to protect itself with cards like Prismatic Strands, while consistently applying pressure with creatures like Sacred Cat and Sneaky Snacker."
