The deck also focuses on generating card advantage with Lead the Stampede and ramp spells like Mwonvuli Acid-Moss. Additionally, it includes efficient creatures like Nyxborn Hydra and Eldrazi Repurposer to apply pressure on your opponent. Malevolent Rumble can provide removal, while Pulse of Murasa offers some lifegain and recursion. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm your opponent with a combination of ramp, card advantage, and aggressive creatures."
