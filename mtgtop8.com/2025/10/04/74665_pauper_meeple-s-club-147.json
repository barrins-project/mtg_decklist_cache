            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly flooding the board with artifact creatures and using cheap spells to deal damage to the opponent. By utilizing cards that benefit from artifacts such as Ichor Wellspring and Galvanic Blast, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures while maintaining card advantage. The inclusion of artifacts like Nihil Spellbomb and Blood Fountain also enables the player to disrupt the opponent's strategy by removing key cards from the graveyard or gaining life. The deck is designed to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
