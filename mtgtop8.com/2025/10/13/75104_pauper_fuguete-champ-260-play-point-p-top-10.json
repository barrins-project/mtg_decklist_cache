It focuses on creating a fast and aggressive early-game board presence, utilizing auras and enchantments like Ethereal Armor and Solid Footing to buff up the creatures and protect them. Armored Armadillo provides a solid defensive option, while cards like Lifelink and Sentinel's Eyes help to sustain the aggro strategy. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly with a swarm of small but powerful creatures."
