The deck also includes cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Goblin Bushwhacker to generate early aggression and maximize damage output. With a mix of creatures, burn spells, and a few utility cards like Rally at the Hornburg, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents through a combination of creature attacks and direct damage spells."
