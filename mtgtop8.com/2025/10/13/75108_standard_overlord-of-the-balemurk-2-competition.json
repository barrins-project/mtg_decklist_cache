The key strategy is to pressure the opponent early with efficient threats like Marauding Mako and Vivi Ornitier, while disrupting their game plan with counter magic and removal spells. By keeping up the pressure and out-valuing the opponent, the deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize or mount a comeback."

With cards like Enduring Curiosity and Floodpits Drowner, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategies and maintain card advantage. Utilizing control elements like Spell Pierce and Duress, as well as powerful finishers like Aclazotz, Deepest Betrayal and Kaito, Bane of Nightmares, the deck looks to close out games efficiently.
