The inclusion of cards like Ledger Shredder and Picklock Prankster helps to protect the Phoenix from removal and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a focus on aggressive play and efficient card selection, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents and secure victory through swift and decisive attacks."
