Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, the Eye of the Storms provide additional control elements, while Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Emrakul, the Promised End serve as win conditions. The deck also includes removal spells like Dismember and board wipes like All Is Dust to stay ahead of the opponent. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to establish mana dominance and overwhelming board presence to secure the win."
