            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and direct damage spells, focusing on quickly reducing their life total to zero. The deck includes powerful red creatures like Burnout Bashtronaut and Nova Hellkite, as well as burn spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike. With a low mana curve and efficient creatures, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and finish the game before the opponent can stabilize. Additionally, cards like Soulstone Sanctuary provide some protection and card advantage to keep up the aggression."
