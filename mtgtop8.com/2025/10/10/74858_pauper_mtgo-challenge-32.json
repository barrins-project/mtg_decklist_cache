The deck also focuses on card draw and selection with Brainstorm, Thought Scour, and Ponder to ensure consistent threats on the board. With a mix of countermagic and bounce spells like Lórien Revealed and Sleep of the Dead, the deck aims to keep the opponent off balance and maintain a fast-paced aggressive strategy."
