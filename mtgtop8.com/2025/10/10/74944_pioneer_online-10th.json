It aims to apply pressure early on with efficient threats like Sentinel of the Nameless City and Ouroboroid, while also having options for dealing with opposing threats through Abrupt Decay and Fatal Push. The inclusion of Winding Constrictor enhances the effectiveness of +1/+1 counters, making creatures like Mosswood Dreadknight and Ornery Tumblewagg even more potent. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's aggressive strategy while providing flexibility in casting spells."
