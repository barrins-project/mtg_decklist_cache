By playing low-cost creatures like Clockwork Percussionist and Goblin Tomb Raider, and using burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, the deck aims to chip away at the opponent's life total and finish them off with direct damage spells. The inclusion of cards like Wrenn's Resolve and Experimental Synthesizer helps to maintain card advantage and provide additional threats on the battlefield. The deck is designed to be fast-paced and efficient in dealing damage to the opponent."
