By utilizing efficient creatures like Voldaren Epicure and Goblin Tomb Raider, along with powerful burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt, the deck can apply constant pressure and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. With cards like Rally at the Hornburg and Wrenn's Resolve, the deck can also recover from board wipes or removal spells, ensuring a relentless onslaught."
