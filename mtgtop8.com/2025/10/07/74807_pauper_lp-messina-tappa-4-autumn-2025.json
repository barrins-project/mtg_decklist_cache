By combining the Aggro strategy with the Affinity mechanic, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast-paced, aggressive playstyle that can quickly close out games. The mana base includes artifact lands to further support the affinity strategy, allowing for the quick casting of powerful artifact creatures and spells."
