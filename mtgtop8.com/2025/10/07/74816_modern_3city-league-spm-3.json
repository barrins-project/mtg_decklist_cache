By discarding cards with Burning Inquiry and Faithless Looting, the deck aims to bring back Vengevine, Detective's Phoenix, and Nethergoyf from the graveyard for additional pressure. With removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt, along with a couple of Arena of Glory for extra damage, this aggressive deck is designed to overwhelm opponents early on and secure a quick victory."
