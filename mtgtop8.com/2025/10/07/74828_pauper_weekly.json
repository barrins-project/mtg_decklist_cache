The deck includes cards that can generate card advantage, disrupt the opponent's strategy, and provide additional reach for the final push towards victory. By combining the power of creatures like Krark-Clan Shaman and Gixian Infiltrator with removal spells like Galvanic Blast and Cleansing Wildfire, the deck aims to apply pressure from multiple angles and force the opponent to constantly react to its threats."
