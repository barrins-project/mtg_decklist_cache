This activates the combo with Dread Return and either Lotleth Giant or Generous Ent, allowing you to quickly deal a large amount of damage to your opponent. The deck also features control elements like Mesmeric Fiend and removal spells like Masked Vandal to disrupt your opponent's strategy while you work towards assembling your combo. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with a powerful combo finish."
