By combining aggressive creatures like Sneaky Snacker and Kitchen Imp with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fiery Temper, the deck aims to pressure the opponent early and finish them off quickly. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Cathartic Reunion and Faithless Looting for card advantage, as well as Alms of the Vein for life gain to stay ahead in the race."
