The deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total by utilizing efficient creatures and direct damage spells, while also utilizing cards like Clockwork Percussionist and Experimental Synthesizer for additional support. With cards like Rally at the Hornburg and Wrenn's Resolve, this deck is designed to maintain pressure and push for a swift victory."
