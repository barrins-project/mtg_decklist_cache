By utilizing the evasive abilities of creatures like Faerie Seer and Ninja of the Deep Hours, along with countermagic like Spellstutter Sprite and Counterspell, the deck aims to quickly pressure the opponent while also maintaining control of the board. With a lower mana curve and card advantage engines like Of One Mind, the deck can outpace opponents and keep them on the back foot throughout the game."
