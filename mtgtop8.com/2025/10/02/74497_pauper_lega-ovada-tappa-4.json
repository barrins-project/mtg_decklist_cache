By using cards such as Gixian Infiltrator and Refurbished Familiar, along with sacrificing artifacts like Ichor Wellspring and Drossforge Bridge, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with creatures and removal spells. Additionally, cards like Nihil Spellbomb provide graveyard hate and disruption, while Krark-Clan Shaman and Fanatical Offering offer additional removal and aggression. The deck's synergy between sacrificing artifacts and generating value makes it a formidable opponent in Pauper 1 vs 1 matchups."
