            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly deploy cheap artifacts and creatures onto the battlefield in order to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression. By utilizing cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to ramp, as well as cards like Memnite and Kappa Cannoneer to quickly build a board presence, this deck aims to apply pressure early and keep the opponent on the back foot. The inclusion of cards like Engineered Explosives and Metallic Rebuke also helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect the deck's own threats."
