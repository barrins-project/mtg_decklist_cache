By combining cards like Myr Enforcer and Galvanic Blast with affinity for artifacts, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and deal damage efficiently. Additionally, the deck includes card draw and removal options to maintain momentum and disrupt the opponent?s strategy. The mana base is focused on ensuring the ability to play colored spells while maximizing artifact synergy."
