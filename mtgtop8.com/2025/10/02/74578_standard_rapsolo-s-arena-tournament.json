By utilizing low cost creatures like Iridescent Vinelasher and Hired Claw, along with efficient removal like Shoot the Sheriff, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and keep the opponent on the back foot. The inclusion of Cavern of Souls helps ensure that creatures can't be countered, and the mana base is carefully balanced to support the aggressive strategy. Overall, the deck aims to win the game swiftly through a combination of creature damage and direct burn spells."
