By efficiently deploying threats and disrupting the opponent's strategy, the Boros Aggro deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory. With a combination of aggressive creatures, removal spells, and powerful lands, the deck seeks to apply pressure from the early turns of the game and maintain tempo to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
