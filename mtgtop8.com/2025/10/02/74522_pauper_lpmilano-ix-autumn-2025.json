By utilizing low-cost creatures like Thermo-Alchemist and Goblin Tomb Raider alongside powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. Experimental Synthesizer provides additional card advantage and Clockwork Percussionist adds extra damage potential. With a mix of creature and spell-based aggression, the deck looks to outpace and outdamage the opponent in a swift and efficient manner."
