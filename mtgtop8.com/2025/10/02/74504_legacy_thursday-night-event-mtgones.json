The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful Eldrazi such as Reality Smasher and Sire of Seven Deaths before they can establish their game plan. The inclusion of Wasteland and Wastescape Battlemage provides additional disruption and helps to control the opponent's mana base. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, disruptive, and resilient against different strategies in the Legacy format."
