Uthros, Titanic Godcore and Roiling Dragonstorm are key pieces to the combo, while Marang River Regent and Evendo, Waking Haven provide additional support. Cavern of Souls helps protect important creatures, while Stock Up and Lost in the Maze provide additional card advantage. Willowrush Verge and Breeding Pool ensure the deck has the mana necessary to pull off the combo successfully."
