The deck focuses on efficiently using mana and maximizing damage output with cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Galvanic Blast. Creatures like Goblin Bushwhacker and Goblin Tomb Raider provide additional damage and board presence. Rally at the Hornburg helps replenish resources and maintain pressure. The goal is to maintain a fast-paced tempo and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

By efficiently leveraging the Orzhov color combination's synergy between white's removal and black's sacrifice effects, the deck aims to outpace opponents and overwhelm them with a combination of early pressure and card advantage. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy while also providing some resilience against opposing control decks."

            "notes": "This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and removal spells. The key strategy is to quickly ramp up mana using land fetch cards like Twisted Landscape and Drossforge Bridge, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Krark-Clan Shaman and Nihil Spellbomb. The deck also includes ways to draw cards and gain life to maintain its aggression. Overall, the key concept is to put pressure on the opponent early and control the board to secure victory in a 1 vs 1 match."
