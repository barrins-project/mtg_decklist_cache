The deck focuses on card advantage and card selection through spells like Consult the Star Charts and Meticulous Archive, while also utilizing disruptive spells like Get Lost and Seam Rip to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The goal is to outlast the opponent and win through attrition and powerful late-game threats."
