Faithless Looting and Grab the Prize provide card advantage and Highway Robbery can steal creatures or remove threats. Vampire's Kiss provides additional lifegain to help sustain the aggressive strategy. Overall, the deck aims to pressure the opponent early and close out the game before they can stabilize."
