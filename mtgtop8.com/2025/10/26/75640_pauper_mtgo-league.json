By efficiently using low-cost creatures and auras, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a strong, fast offense. The key strategy is to stick with a game plan of aggressive aura attachment to create a formidable threat that can quickly close out the game. This deck requires precise timing and resource management to maximize the power of the auras and secure a victory."
