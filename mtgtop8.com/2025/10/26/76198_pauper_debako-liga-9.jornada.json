The key strategy is to outlast opponents by maintaining board presence with token creatures from Khalni Garden and sacrificing effects like Crypt Rats to clear the way for powerful threats like Avenging Hunter and Troll of Khazad-dûm. The deck also includes graveyard hate with Nihil Spellbomb and Bojuka Bog to disrupt opposing strategies. Overall, the deck aims to grind out opponents while gaining incremental advantages over time."
