The strategy involves using cards like Ethereal Armor, Armadillo Cloak, and Ancestral Mask to buff up creatures like Gladecover Scout and Slippery Bogle while also providing protection with cards like Sheltering Landscape and Benevolent Blessing. The goal is to create a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure throughout the game to secure a fast victory."
