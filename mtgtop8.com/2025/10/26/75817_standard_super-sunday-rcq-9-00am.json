            "notes": "This deck focuses on low-cost creatures with powerful abilities to quickly build a board presence and overwhelm the opponent. By utilizing cards like Sheltered by Ghosts and Crystal Barricade to protect key creatures like Peter Parker and Toby, the deck aims to push through damage consistently. Collector's Cage provides additional protection while cards like Craterhoof Behemoth and Overlord of the Mistmoors can quickly end the game with a burst of damage. The mana base is designed to ensure a steady flow of colors to support the aggressive strategy."
