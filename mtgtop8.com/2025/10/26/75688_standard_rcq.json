With a mix of cheap creatures like Steamcore Scholar and Marauding Mako, along with powerful spells like Winternight Stories and Torch the Tower, this deck aims to quickly deal damage to your opponent and control the board. By utilizing cards like Into the Flood Maw and Profit's Eidetic Memory, you can maintain card advantage while keeping the pressure on your opponent."
