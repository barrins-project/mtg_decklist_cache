The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining a steady stream of card advantage through cantrips and card draw spells like Ponder and Deep Analysis. With a low mana curve and a high density of instants and sorceries, the deck looks to overwhelm the opponent with tempo plays and efficient use of resources."
