Cards like Thoughtseize and Duress help to strip away the opponent's resources, while cards like Fatal Push, Go for the Throat, and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse deal with threats on the board. The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil for card advantage and disruption. The goal is to control the game and outvalue the opponent until victory is secured."
