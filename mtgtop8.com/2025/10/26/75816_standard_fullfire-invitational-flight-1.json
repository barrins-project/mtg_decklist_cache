Cards like Bringer of the Last Gift and Harvester of Misery provide graveyard recursion, while Superior Spider-Man and Overlord of the Balemurk pack a punch once they hit the battlefield. Esper Origins and Awaken the Honored Dead help set up the combo, while Vein Ripper and Steamcore Scholar provide early game control. The mana base is built to support the combo strategy with a mix of lands that enable fast reanimation."

The inclusion of card draw and removal spells like Abrade and Torch the Tower helps maintain tempo and pressure the opponent. Multiversal Passage and Soulstone Sanctuary provide mana fixing and additional resources to keep the aggression going."
