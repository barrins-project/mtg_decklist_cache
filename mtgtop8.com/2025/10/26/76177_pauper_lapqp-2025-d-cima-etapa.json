By using cards like Cast Down and Krark-Clan Shaman, the deck aims to control the board and eliminate threats, while also generating value with cards like Ichor Wellspring and Writhing Chrysalis. Additionally, the deck has some graveyard hate with cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Crypt Incursion, as well as a touch of recursion and lifegain to stay in the game longer. This aggressive Jund deck focuses on flexibility and resource management to outpace the opponent."
