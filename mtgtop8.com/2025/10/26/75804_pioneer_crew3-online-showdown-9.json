By playing low-cost creatures like Mausoleum Wanderer and Spectral Sailor, and using cards like Curious Obsession to draw more cards, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent while disrupting their strategy with cards like Spell Queller. The inclusion of cards like Sheltered by Ghosts and Geistlight Snare helps protect key creatures and maintain board control. Overall, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
