By utilizing cards like Kitchen Imp, Voldaren Epicure, and Sneaky Snacker, along with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fiery Temper, the deck aims to quickly deal damage to the opponent. Supporting cards like Alms of the Vein and Vampire's Kiss provide additional reach, while Faithless Looting helps with card selection and graveyard manipulation. The deck's mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy with a mix of lands that produce colored mana and help with card draw."
