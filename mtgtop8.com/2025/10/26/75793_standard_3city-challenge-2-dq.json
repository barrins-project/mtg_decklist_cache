By using cards like Day of Judgment and Lightning Helix to control the board, along with Jeskai Revelation for card advantage, the goal is to outlast the opponent and overwhelm them with powerful late-game spells like Ultima. The mana base is set up to support the deck's three colors and ensure consistent access to all card types. The deck aims to pace the game and gradually take over with its powerful spells and removal."
