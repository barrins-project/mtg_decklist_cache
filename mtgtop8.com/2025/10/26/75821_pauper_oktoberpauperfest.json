This allows the player to cast powerful spells or win the game using Valakut Invoker's ability. The Walls Combo archetype utilizes a variety of creatures that benefit from having defenders in play, such as Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement, to establish a strong board presence and achieve the combo win condition efficiently."
