By utilizing cards like Thoughtseize and Teferi, Time Raveler to control the opponent's resources, while deploying powerful creatures like Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd and Overlord of the Balemurk to apply pressure, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can execute their game plan. The addition of cards like Ephemerate and Solitude provide additional removal and protection, allowing the deck to maintain its aggression while disrupting the opponent's strategy."
