The deck also utilizes artifacts like Drossforge Bridge and Ichor Wellspring to generate card advantage and mana acceleration. In addition, the deck includes various ways to recur or sacrifice creatures, such as Refurbished Familiar and Fanatical Offering, to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent."
