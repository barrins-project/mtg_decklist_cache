The deck also includes cards like Gifted Aetherborn and Graveyard Trespasser to apply pressure while maintaining a solid defense. The mana base is designed to support the deck's strategy with utility lands like Castle Locthwain and Mutavault."

The deck includes various spells for removal and card draw to help facilitate this game plan, as well as a mix of creatures and protection spells to help maintain board presence and protect the key threats. The mana base is optimized for casting spells efficiently and consistently."
