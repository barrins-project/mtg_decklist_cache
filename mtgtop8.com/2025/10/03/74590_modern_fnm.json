With cards like Thoughtseize and Spell Pierce to disrupt your opponent's game plan, along with removal spells like Fatal Push, this deck aims to quickly overwhelm your opponent with big, dangerous creatures. It focuses on combining graveyard manipulation with reanimation to create a powerful, aggressive strategy."
