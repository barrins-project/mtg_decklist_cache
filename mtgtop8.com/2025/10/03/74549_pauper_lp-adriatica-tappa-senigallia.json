            "notes": "This deck aims to quickly fill the graveyard with creatures by discarding them with cards like Cathartic Reunion and Faithless Looting, then utilizing Dread Return to reanimate powerful creatures like Lotleth Giant. The combo aspect comes from using Scrapwork Mutt to sacrifice creatures for value, while also utilizing Molten Gatekeeper for additional graveyard manipulation. The deck's strategy revolves around speed and efficiency, using cheap creatures and spells to set up explosive plays and overwhelm the opponent with reanimated threats."
