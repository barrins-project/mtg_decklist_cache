By maximizing the potential of legendary creatures like Jhoira, Weatherlight Captain and utilizing cards like Mox Amber to ramp up mana, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence early in the game. With a mix of powerful creatures like Cecil, Dark Knight and supportive spells like Relic of Legends, the deck is designed to maintain pressure and control throughout the match, making it difficult for opponents to recover."
