At the same time, the deck aims to apply constant pressure with efficient creatures like Murktide Regent and Brazen Borrower. In addition, card draw and selection cards like Brainstorm and Ponder are included to ensure consistent draws and maintain card advantage. The mana base is designed to support the dual-colored nature of the deck while also disrupting the opponent's mana base with Wasteland."

By using efficient spells like Lightning Bolt and Mutagenic Growth, along with creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Dragon's Rage Channeler, the deck aims to apply pressure early and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Land Grant and Mishra's Bauble helps ensure the deck has consistent access to its resources, allowing for a fast and aggressive playstyle."
