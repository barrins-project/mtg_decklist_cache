By utilizing cards like Fanatical Offering and Writhing Chrysalis, the deck can generate value from sacrificing creatures while also controlling the opponent's board with cards like Cast Down and Cleansing Wildfire. The deck also includes a mix of removal, card draw, and graveyard hate to adapt to various matchups. Overall, the key strategy is to apply pressure with aggressive creatures while also disrupting the opponent's game plan through sacrifice and removal effects."
