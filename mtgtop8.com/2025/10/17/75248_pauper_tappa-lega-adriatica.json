It utilizes cards like Ancestral Mask, Ethereal Armor, and Armadillo Cloak to pump up creatures and deal heavy damage. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of evasive creatures like Slippery Bogle and Silhana Ledgewalker, while also gaining life and protecting creatures with enchantments. The deck aims to quickly close out the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
