Mishra's Bauble and Expressive Iteration help with card advantage and selection. The deck aims to play fast and pressure the opponent, quickly reducing their life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to both red and blue mana sources."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Kozilek's Command and Malevolent Rumble, while also generating advantage with Sowing Mycospawn and Devourer of Destiny. The deck can quickly bring out powerful Eldrazi threats like Emrakul, the Promised End and World Breaker to dominate the late game. The deck is designed to overwhelm opponents with a combination of control elements and powerful Eldrazi creatures."

The deck also includes some disruption with Spell Snare and interaction with cards like Wrenn and Six. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's strategy."
