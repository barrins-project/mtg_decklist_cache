The deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total before they have a chance to stabilize. Cards like Monstrous Rage, Burst Lightning, and Heroes' Hangout help deal damage directly to the opponent or clear their blockers. The creatures in the deck, such as Emberheart Challenger and Questing Druid, are aggressive and can quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. The deck seeks to win the game before the opponent can mount a strong defense."

The deck also utilizes a variety of removal spells and sweepers to deal with opposing threats, while slowly grinding out games with card advantage engines and powerful finishers like The Wandering Emperor and Castle Ardenvale."
