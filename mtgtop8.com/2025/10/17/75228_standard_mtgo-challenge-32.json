            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing creatures with various abilities to control the board and apply pressure to the opponent quickly. By combining disruptive cards and aggressive creatures, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while steadily chipping away at their life total. Cards like Floodpits Drowner and Spyglass Siren provide both aggression and control, while Enduring Curiosity and Multiversal Passage offer card advantage and flexibility in the deck's strategy. With a mix of removal spells and evasive threats, this Dimir Aggro deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
