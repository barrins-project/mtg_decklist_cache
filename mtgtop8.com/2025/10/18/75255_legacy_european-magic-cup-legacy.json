It also includes backup card draw and interaction in the form of Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student, Ponder, Brainstorm, and Force of Will. The deck's mana base is tailored to support the combo while also providing some protection with cards like Swords to Plowshares and Daze. The key to this deck is to efficiently mill yourself and win the game through a combo finish."
