The deck focuses on controlling the board with cards like Day of Judgment and Lightning Helix, as well as generating value through cards like Jeskai Revelation and Meticulous Archive. Additionally, the deck includes win conditions like Marang River Regent and Ultima to close out the game once the opponent's threats have been dealt with. The mana base is designed to provide a consistent supply of all three colors of mana needed for the deck's spells."

By playing efficient creatures like Burnout Bashtronaut and Razorkin Needlehead, combined with direct damage spells like Lightning Strike and Burst Lightning, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. Supporting cards like Soulstone Sanctuary and Witchstalker Frenzy provide additional value and protection. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Nova Hellkite and Inti, Seneschal of the Sun to close out the game."
