The deck aims to control the game by using cards like Fatal Push, Thoughtseize, and Duress to disrupt the opponent's game plan while deploying threats like Bloodtithe Collector and Graveyard Trespasser to close out the game quickly. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse, along with versatile removal like Go for the Throat and Abrade, make this deck a formidable force in the Pioneer 1 vs 1 format."
