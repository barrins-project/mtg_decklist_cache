The deck focuses on resource management and patience, utilizing a combination of control elements to dictate the pace of the game and ultimately come out on top."

The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent through constant creature attacks and burn spells, taking advantage of the lower mana curve to quickly build a board presence and deal damage. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Nova Hellkite and Emberheart Challenger, alongside efficient removal spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike, ensures that the deck can maintain a strong offensive strategy throughout the game."
