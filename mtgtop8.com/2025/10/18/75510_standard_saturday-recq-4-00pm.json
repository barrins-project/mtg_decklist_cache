The deck focuses on early creature drops like Llanowar Elves and Ouroboroid to apply pressure on the opponent quickly. Sentinel of the Nameless City and Pawpatch Recruit provide additional threats, while cards like Spyglass Siren and Jackal, Genius Geneticist offer disruption and card advantage. The deck also includes removal options like Into the Flood Maw and Repulsive Mutation to deal with opposing threats. Additionally, there are cards like Enduring Curiosity and Surrak, Elusive Hunter to provide additional value and flexibility."
