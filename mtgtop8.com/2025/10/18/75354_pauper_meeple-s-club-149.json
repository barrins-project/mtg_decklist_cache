The deck also includes card draw spells like Winding Way and Lead the Stampede to help maintain card advantage. Masked Vandal provides versatile removal options while Jaspera Sentinel and Avenging Hunter offer additional aggressive options. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a swarm of Elves and outvalue them with efficient creatures and card draw."
