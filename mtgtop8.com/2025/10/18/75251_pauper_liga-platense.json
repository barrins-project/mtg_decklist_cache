Additional draw power from cards like Brainstorm and Deep Analysis helps maintain card advantage.

By efficiently casting cheap spells and creatures that can hit the opponent directly, this deck focuses on overwhelming the opponent with damage and winning through aggressive tactics rather than long-term strategy. Aggro-Burn decks like this one prioritize speed and direct damage to secure victory in a fast-paced Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
