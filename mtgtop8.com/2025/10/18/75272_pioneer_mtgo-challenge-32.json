The key strategy involves playing efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage early on, then using burn spells like Burst Lightning and Reckless Rage to control the board and finish off opponents. The inclusion of Kumano, Faces Kakkazan and Monstrous Rage provide additional removal and damage options, while land cards like Den of the Bugbear and Ramunap Ruins offer late-game reach. The deck aims to be fast, relentless, and able to close out games quickly."

The key strategy is to gradually outvalue the opponent by using cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Memory Deluge to maintain card advantage, while also controlling the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Portable Hole. The addition of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by blinking permanents like The Wandering Emperor and Meticulous Archive. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and eventually win through incremental advantage."
