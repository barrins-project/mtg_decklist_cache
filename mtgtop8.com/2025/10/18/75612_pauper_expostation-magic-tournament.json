The focus is on building a strong board presence quickly and using cards like Rancor and Vines of Vastwood to enhance the creatures' abilities and push through damage efficiently. The deck also includes some graveyard hate in the form of Relic of Progenitus and has a resilient aspect with cards like Young Wolf and Tumbleweed Rising to keep up the pressure. Overall, this deck aims to win through brute force and swift attacks."
