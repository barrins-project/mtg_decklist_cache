Additionally, the inclusion of artifact lands and artifact creatures allows for synergy with cards like Experimental Synthesizer and Cleansing Wildfire to ramp and fix mana. The deck's strategy is to maintain tempo and pressure throughout the game to secure victory."

By using gates to fix mana and gain life, the deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a dominant board presence with creatures like Guardian of the Guildpact and Squadron Hawk. The inclusion of cards like Prismatic Strands and Thraben Charm provide additional protection and utility, while cards like Brainstorm and Lórien Revealed help to ensure consistency and card advantage. Overall, this deck thrives on disruption and resource management to outlast and outmaneuver opponents."
