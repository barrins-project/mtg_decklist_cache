It also includes card draw and creature recursion to maintain card advantage and outvalue the opponent. The creatures in the deck provide additional utility and can help control the board while applying pressure. The mana base is optimized to support the deck's main game plan and ensure the deck runs smoothly. Overall, this deck aims to outmaneuver the opponent and win through incremental advantage and control."
