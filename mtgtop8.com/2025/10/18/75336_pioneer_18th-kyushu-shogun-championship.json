It also utilizes a companion creature to provide additional value and support. The deck has a strong control theme, aiming to disrupt the opponent's game plan while slowly advancing its own win condition through incremental advantage and card advantage. Additionally, the deck includes various lands to support its game plan, including utility lands for additional options and flexibility in different situations."
