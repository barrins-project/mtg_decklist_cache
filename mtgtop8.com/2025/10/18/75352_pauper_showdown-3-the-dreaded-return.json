It also includes a mix of card draw, counterspells, and graveyard recursion to keep the pressure on and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to win the game quickly by overwhelming the opponent with efficient threats and protecting them with counterspells. It is a fast-paced deck that rewards careful resource management and aggressive play."
