With a combination of cycling creatures, mana accelerants, and graveyard recursion, the deck aims to create explosive turns where it can cast multiple spells in succession, culminating in a lethal attack or overwhelming advantage over the opponent. The key strategy is to efficiently cycle through the deck, generate mana with rituals and Lotus Petal, and then cast Reaping the Graves or Songs of the Damned to bring back multiple creatures and repeat the process."
