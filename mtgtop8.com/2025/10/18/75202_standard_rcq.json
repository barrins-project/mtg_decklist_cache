By combining powerful creatures like Nova Hellkite and Emberheart Challenger with efficient removal like Lightning Helix and Burst Lightning, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total while maintaining board control. Rockface Village and Soulstone Sanctuary provide additional support for the aggressive strategy, allowing the deck to apply constant pressure and finish the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The land base is designed to support the control strategy by providing the necessary mana sources for casting spells efficiently."
