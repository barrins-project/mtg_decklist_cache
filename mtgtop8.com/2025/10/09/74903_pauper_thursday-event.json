The deck also includes ways to discard these creatures, such as Faithless Looting and Insolent Neonate, and disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Duress. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures early in the game and secure a victory through powerful combos and reanimation strategies."
