By utilizing cards that generate extra value when sacrificed, the deck aims to maintain card advantage while applying pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of artifact destruction spells also allows for disruption of the opponent's game plan, while land destruction effects can slow down the opponent's mana development. Overall, the deck aims to be fast-paced and punishing, with a focus on resource management and efficient creature deployment."
