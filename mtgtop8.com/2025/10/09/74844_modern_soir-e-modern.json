By leveraging cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum for mana acceleration, as well as disruption with Metallic Rebuke, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and tempo advantage. Urza's Saga provides additional value by tutoring for key artifacts, while Thoughtcast and Mishra's Bauble assist with card draw and deck filtering. The deck's strategy revolves around efficiently deploying threats and disrupting the opponent's game plan to secure a quick victory."
