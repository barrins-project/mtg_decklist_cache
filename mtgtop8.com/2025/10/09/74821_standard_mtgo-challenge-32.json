The key strategy is to stall the game until late game, where the player can start casting powerful card draw spells like Jeskai Revelation and Mystical Teachings to overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes a selection of versatile removal spells like Lightning Helix and Day of Judgment to deal with threats as they arise. Additionally, the deck utilizes a land base that provides access to multiple colors, allowing for flexibility in casting spells."
