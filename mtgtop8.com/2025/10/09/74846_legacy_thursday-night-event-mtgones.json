Its key strategy is to apply constant pressure on the opponent's life total by efficiently using cheap and direct damage spells while also utilizing creatures that can attack for damage each turn. By maximizing the use of burn spells and aggressive creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and finish the game before they have a chance to stabilize or mount a defense."
