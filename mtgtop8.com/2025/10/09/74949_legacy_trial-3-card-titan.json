The deck aims to disrupt opponents with counterspells like Force of Will and efficiently deal with threats using removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Prismatic Ending. Additionally, board presence is built through creatures like Snapcaster Mage and Magus of the Moon while maintaining consistency through card selection and manipulation with Ponder and Brainstorm. The inclusion of cards like Back to Basics and Dress Down further adds layers to its control strategy."
