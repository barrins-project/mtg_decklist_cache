The deck includes a mix of countermagic and card draw spells to control the game while maintaining pressure on the opponent. By combining efficient threats with disruptive spells like Counterspell and Boomerang, the deck aims to maintain tempo and outpace the opponent to secure a victory. With a focus on early aggression and disruption, this deck seeks to quickly close out games before the opponent can stabilize."

The deck includes cards that help you find and protect your combo pieces, such as Lead the Stampede and Sagu Wildling. By generating mana with creatures like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement, you can quickly set up your combo and secure the win. The key strategy is to efficiently mill your deck and unleash a devastating Lotleth Giant finisher on your opponent."
