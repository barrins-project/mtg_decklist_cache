By quickly building up a board presence with creature buffs and generating card advantage with cards like \"Lead the Stampede\", the deck aims to maintain pressure and close out the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan. Additionally, the inclusion of mana fixing cards like \"Abundant Growth\" and land cards like \"Thriving Grove\" and \"Thriving Heath\" ensures a smooth curve and consistent access to mana sources for casting multiple spells each turn."
