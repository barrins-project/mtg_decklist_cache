Gatecreeper Vine and Saruli Caretaker help to ramp up your mana, while Masked Vandal provides utility for dealing with opposing threats. Malevolent Rumble acts as a board wipe option, while Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to refill your hand with creatures."

The deck includes various artifacts and creatures that can be sacrificed for additional effects, as well as ways to gain life and deal damage to opponents. The goal is to establish board control and outvalue the opponent with efficient resource management and strong card advantage."
