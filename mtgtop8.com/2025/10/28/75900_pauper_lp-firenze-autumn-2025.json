This allows for explosive plays with Timberwatch Elf and Nyxborn Hydra, while also gaining valuable life with Wellwisher. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to refill the hand with more creatures, ensuring a consistent stream of threats. Masked Vandal provides utility by removing problematic artifacts or enchantments. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of elves and powerful creatures."
