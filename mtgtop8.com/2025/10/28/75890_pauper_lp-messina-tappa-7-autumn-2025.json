The deck focuses on ramping up mana with creatures like Saruli Caretaker and Gatecreeper Vine while also utilizing cards like Winding Way and Lead the Stampede to dig deeper into the deck for combo pieces. Overall, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces to overwhelm the opponent and secure a victory."
