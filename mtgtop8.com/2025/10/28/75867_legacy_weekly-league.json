Cards like Bonus Round, Ral, Monsoon Mage, and Reckless Impulse are used to create explosive turns where multiple spells can be cast in a single turn. Burning Wish is used to tutor for specific spells from the sideboard to further the combo and win the game in a single turn. This deck aims to win quickly through a powerful combo sequence."
