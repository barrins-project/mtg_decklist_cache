The goal is to establish a board presence early on and consistently deal damage to the opponent while maintaining card advantage through card draw effects. The inclusion of cards like Galvanic Blast and Reckoner's Bargain allows for efficient removal and additional reach to close out the game. The mana base is composed of artifact lands and bridges to ensure smooth color fixing and support the affinity mechanic."
