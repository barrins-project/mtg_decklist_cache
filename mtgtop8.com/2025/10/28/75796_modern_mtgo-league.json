Alongside these disruptive elements, the deck also includes card advantage engines like Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student and Quantum Riddler. The inclusion of creatures like Psychic Frog and Orcish Bowmasters provide additional utilities and threats. The deck aims to control the board and the opponent's resources, while generating card advantage to eventually secure victory through card advantage and efficient removal."
