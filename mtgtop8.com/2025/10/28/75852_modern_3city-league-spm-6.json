The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of elf creatures, utilizing powerful finishers like Ezuri, Renegade Leader to pump the team and close out the game quickly. The deck also includes some utility creatures and cards to deal with opposing threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
