The deck aims to apply pressure to the opponent early on, utilizing a mix of low-cost creatures and removal spells to control the board and deal damage efficiently. By combining creature aggression with direct damage and life gain, the deck seeks to maintain a fast-paced, aggressive playstyle that keeps the opponent on the back foot."
