            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly deploying artifacts onto the battlefield to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures. The key strategy involves using cards like Refurbished Familiar and Myr Enforcer to take advantage of the Affinity mechanic, allowing for explosive plays early in the game. Additional support comes from cards like Galvanic Blast and Reckoner's Bargain to deal direct damage to the opponent while also drawing cards to maintain momentum. The deck's mana base is optimized to support the aggressive artifact strategy, ensuring a consistent flow of threats to pressure the opponent."
