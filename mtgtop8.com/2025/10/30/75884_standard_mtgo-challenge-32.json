The deck aims to control the board and stay ahead on resources with cards like Jeskai Revelation and Molten Exhale, allowing the pilot to eventually overwhelm the opponent with powerful finishers like Ultima and Marang River Regent. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to all three colors of mana while minimizing the risk of being disrupted by opposing land destruction."
