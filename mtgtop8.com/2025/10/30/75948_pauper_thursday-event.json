The deck aims to apply early pressure, utilizing efficient creatures like Clockwork Percussionist and Goblin Tomb Raider along with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast to finish off the opponent quickly. By focusing on aggressive plays and dealing damage as fast as possible, this deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize or mount a defense."
