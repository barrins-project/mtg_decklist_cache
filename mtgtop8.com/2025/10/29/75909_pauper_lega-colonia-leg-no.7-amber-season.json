The deck also includes God-Pharaoh's Faithful and Cryogen Relic for early game defense, Sunscape Familiar to reduce the cost of spells, and The Modern Age as a win condition. With a mix of counterspells like Prohibit and Snap to control the opponent's plays, this deck aims to outvalue and outlast its opponents in a grindy matchup."
