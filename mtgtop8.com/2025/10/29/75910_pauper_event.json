Once the Urzatron is assembled, the deck aims to gain control of the game by playing big threat creatures and using removal spells to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, the deck includes cards that provide card advantage and ramp to ensure a consistent flow of resources throughout the game. The key strategy is to efficiently ramp up mana and control the board until victory is achieved."

By utilizing creatures with abilities that trigger when spells are cast, as well as direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast, the deck aims to deal damage efficiently while also maintaining card advantage through Faithless Looting and Highway Robbery. With a low mana curve and a strong emphasis on dealing damage directly to the opponent, this deck is designed to secure a quick victory through a combination of creature attacks and burn spells."
