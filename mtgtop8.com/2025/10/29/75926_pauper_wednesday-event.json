The deck aims to stall the opponent's threats while setting up card advantage, eventually overwhelming them with efficient creatures like Spellstutter Sprite and Ninja of the Deep Hours. The inclusion of card selection spells like Preordain and Brainstorm ensures consistency in drawing the necessary answers, while cards like Lórien Revealed and Gurmag Angler provide powerful late-game threats. Overall, the deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan and asserting dominance through strategic plays."
