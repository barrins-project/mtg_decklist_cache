The deck also includes creatures with disruptive abilities like Spellstutter Sprite and Faerie Miscreant, along with value-generating cards such as Augur of Bolas and Thorn of the Black Rose. Overall, this Dimir Control deck aims to stall the opponent's game plan while building up its own resources for a powerful late game."

The deck includes a variety of cantrips and card draw spells to help find the necessary pieces, as well as some disruptive elements like Gigadrowse to protect the combo. The inclusion of bounce spells like Snap and Hidden Strings can help to buy time or disrupt the opponent's game plan."
