            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly build a powerful board of Elf creatures and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive attacks. By utilizing cards like Quirion Ranger and Priest of Titania to ramp up mana production, the deck can play out its threats like Nyxborn Hydra and Timberwatch Elf at a rapid pace. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to refill the hand with more Elves, while cards like Generous Ent and Avenging Hunter provide additional value and potential finishers. Overall, this deck aims to swarm the battlefield and capitalize on the tribal synergy of Elves to outpace and out-muscle the opponent."
