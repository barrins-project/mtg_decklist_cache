By utilizing cards that generate card advantage like Thoughtcast and Mishra's Bauble, as well as synergies between artifacts like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, the deck aims to establish a threatening board state early in the game. With a mix of removal and disruption spells like Engineered Explosives and Metallic Rebuke, the deck seeks to disrupt the opponent's game plan while pushing for a quick victory."
