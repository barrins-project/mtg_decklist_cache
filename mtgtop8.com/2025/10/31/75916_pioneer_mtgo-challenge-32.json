Ultimately, the deck relies on synergy between its cards to achieve victory."

The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value through blinking creatures and permanents.

With a combination of counterspells, board wipes, and enchantments, this UW Control deck aims to outlast the opponent and control the game until it can secure a win condition."
