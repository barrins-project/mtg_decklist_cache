            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to flood the board with cheap artifact creatures and utilize various artifact-based spells to disrupt the opponent and maintain board presence. By utilizing mana-efficient creatures and spells like Glint Hawk, Myr Enforcer, and Thoughtcast, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly with aggressive plays. The inclusion of artifact lands and affinity cards like Refurbished Familiar and Metallic Rebuke further enhances the deck's synergy and allows for explosive early-game plays. Additionally, the deck includes some resource disruption elements like Raven's Crime and Grim Bauble to control the tempo of the game."
