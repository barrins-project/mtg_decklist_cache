The deck also includes card draw and selection spells such as Brainstorm, Ponder, and Thought Scour to maintain consistency and find key cards. Sleep of the Dead offers a tempo swing by tapping down opposing creatures, while Lórien Revealed provides a strong finisher. The focus is on controlling the board and applying pressure to the opponent to secure a quick victory."
