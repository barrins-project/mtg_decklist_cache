The deck also utilizes card draw and self-mill effects like Brainstorm, Mental Note, and Thought Scour to fuel graveyard synergies and enable the casting of powerful spells like Lórien Revealed. A few control elements like Dispel and Sleep of the Dead are included to protect the aggro game plan and maintain board presence."
