The inclusion of Treasure Cruise provides additional card draw and fuel for the graveyard recursion strategy, while Picklock Prankster and Cori-Steel Cutter offer additional ways to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to be fast and relentless in its assault, aiming to close out games quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
