The deck includes cards that allow you to sacrifice creatures for various benefits, such as drawing cards or dealing damage, as well as ways to bring those creatures back from the graveyard. By combining these effects with efficient Goblin creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and establish a dominant board presence."
