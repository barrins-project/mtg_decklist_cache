The key focus is on using the synergy between cards like Steamcore Scholar, Fear of Missing Out, and Winternight Stories to create an aggressive tempo that can finish off opponents quickly. The inclusion of card draw and control elements like Quantum Riddler and Proft's Eidetic Memory help to keep the pressure on while maintaining card advantage. Agatha's Soul Cauldron also provides a powerful late-game option for closing out the game."
