Then, using cards like Unearth and Persist, you can bring these creatures back onto the battlefield without having to pay their mana costs. The deck focuses on surprising your opponent by reanimating strong threats out of nowhere and overwhelming them with a sudden board presence. This strategy aims to win the game through a powerful combo of graveyard manipulation and reanimation."
