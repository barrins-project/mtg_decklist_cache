By consistently playing low-cost creatures and burn spells, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Nova Hellkite and Emberheart Challenger adds additional pressure and allows for potential big swings in the game. The deck is designed to be fast-paced and relentless, aiming to finish the game before the opponent can mount a strong defense."
