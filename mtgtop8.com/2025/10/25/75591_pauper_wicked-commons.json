By utilizing a combination of direct damage from spells like Chain Lightning, Lightning Bolt, and Fireblast, along with a consistent stream of creatures like Voldaren Epicure, Goblin Tomb Raider, and Kessig Flamebreather, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. Additionally, cards like Thermo-Alchemist and Clockwork Percussionist provide additional damage and utility, creating a fast-paced and relentless aggro strategy."
