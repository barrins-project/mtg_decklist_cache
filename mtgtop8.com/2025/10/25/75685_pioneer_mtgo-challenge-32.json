            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly filling the graveyard with instants and sorceries to bring back Arclight Phoenix repeatedly from the graveyard to deal consistent damage to the opponent. It also utilizes card draw and selection spells to find the necessary pieces to execute the strategy efficiently. The inclusion of removal spells and disruptive creatures helps maintain board control and protect the Phoenixes. The deck aims to be a fast-paced and aggressive deck that can overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and creatures."
