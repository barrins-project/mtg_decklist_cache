By playing powerful early creatures like Burnout Bashtronaut and Emberheart Challenger, followed by efficient burn spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to reduce the opponent's life total as quickly as possible. The inclusion of cards like Nova Hellkite and Razorkin Needlehead provide additional sources of damage to close out the game. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy with mostly Mountains and a few utility lands like Rockface Village and Soulstone Sanctuary."
