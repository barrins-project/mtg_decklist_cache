The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by utilizing cards like Beza, the Bounding Spring and Mazemind Tome for card advantage, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Essence Scatter and Day of Judgment. The deck also includes some graveyard hate with Rest in Peace and Ugin, Eye of the Storms to further control the opponent's resources. Overall, the key strategy is to stay ahead of the opponent and control the game tempo."
