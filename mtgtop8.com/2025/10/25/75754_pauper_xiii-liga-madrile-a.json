Myr creatures and Golem Foundry provide additional threats, while Weather the Storm and Malevolent Rumble offer protection and board control. The deck can also generate value by sacrificing artifacts with Ashnod's Altar and using Myr Retriever to recur key pieces. Overall, the key strategy revolves around efficient resource management and disruption to outlast the opponent."
