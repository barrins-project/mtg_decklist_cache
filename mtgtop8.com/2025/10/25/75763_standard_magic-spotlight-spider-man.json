            "notes": "This UR Aggro deck focuses on quickly dealing damage to the opponent through a combination of aggressive creatures and powerful burn spells. The deck includes cards that allow for card draw and card advantage to maintain pressure on the opponent. With a mix of cheap creatures and removal spells, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early in the game and finish them off before they can stabilize. By combining aggression with spell-slinging tactics, this deck is designed to close out games quickly and efficiently."
