The key strategy revolves around building a wide board presence and pressuring the opponent, using cards like Fear of Missing Out and Marauding Mako. Card advantage is also crucial with cards like Vivi Ornitier and Prof's Eidetic Memory, helping to maintain steam in the late game. The deck aims to close out games quickly by overwhelming the opponent with damage and efficient spells."
