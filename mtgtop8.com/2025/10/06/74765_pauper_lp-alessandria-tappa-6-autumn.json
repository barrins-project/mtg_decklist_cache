The deck aims to efficiently remove threats with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Skred, counter opponent's spells with Counterspell and Spell Pierce, and generate value with cards like Murmuring Mystic and Lórien Revealed. The mana base consists of snow-covered lands to enable synergies with some cards in the deck. Overall, the deck prioritizes control and card advantage to outlast opponents."
