By generating card advantage through sacrificing artifacts and utilizing bounce effects like Writhing Chrysalis, the deck aims to maintain board presence and tempo advantage. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Blood Fountain and Nihil Spellbomb offers graveyard hate against potential strategies reliant on recursion. This aggressive approach is further supported by the mana base that ensures consistent access to the necessary colors."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, protect its own threats, and close out the game quickly by utilizing a mix of direct damage, card draw, and efficient creatures. By maintaining a balance between aggression and control, the deck aims to outmaneuver opponents and secure victory through a combination of tempo plays and well-timed spells."
