Cards like Spell Pierce and Bitter Triumph provide additional disruption and protection, while powerful finishers like Kaito, Bane of Nightmares and Cecil, Dark Knight can help seal the deal. Multiversal Passage and Soulstone Sanctuary provide additional flexibility and resilience to keep your aggro strategy going strong."
