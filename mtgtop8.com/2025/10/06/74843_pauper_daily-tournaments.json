            "notes": "The main focus of this Gruul Aggro deck is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and efficient removal spells. By using mana ramp from Arbor Elf, Utopia Sprawl, and Wild Growth, the deck aims to quickly deploy threats such as Boarding Party, Annoyed Altisaur, and Avenging Hunter. Malevolent Rumble and Ram Through provide removal options, while Eldrazi Repurposer and Writhing Chrysalis offer additional value. The deck is designed to apply pressure early and maintain board control throughout the game, ultimately leading to a quick victory against the opponent."
