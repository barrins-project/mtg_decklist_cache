By controlling the board and manipulating your own draws, you aim to outlast your opponent and win the game with either card advantage or a well-timed threat. The deck focuses on maintaining control of the game while also providing some evasive threats to close out the game. It combines reactive cards like Counterspell and Snuff Out with card draw spells like Preordain and Brainstorm to outmaneuver your opponent."

The key strategy involves using efficient creatures like Thraben Inspector and Kor Skyfisher to apply early pressure, while cards like Battle Screech and Guardians' Pledge provide additional creatures for a strong attack. Prismatic Strands offers protection from removal spells, while Novice Inspector helps with card advantage. The inclusion of the Spider-Man, Web-Slinger and other utility cards adds versatility to the deck's aggressive game plan."
