It focuses on using cards like Fleeting Spirit and Seasoned Hallowblade to protect the combo pieces while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Fatal Push and Thoughtseize. The mana base is designed to support the combo pieces with lands like Geier Reach Sanitarium and The Mycosynth Gardens, while providing the necessary color fixing with cards like Brightclimb Pathway and Concealed Courtyard. Overall, the deck aims to quickly set up its combo and overwhelm the opponent."
