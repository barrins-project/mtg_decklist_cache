The key strategy is to ramp up quickly, generate value with artifacts like Myr Retriever and Prophetic Prism, and eventually overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Pactdoll Terror and Golem Foundry.

It utilizes a mix of efficient counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to outvalue the opponent and maintain control of the board. The deck also includes a few win conditions in the form of creatures like Murmuring Mystic and Lórien Revealed, which can help close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. The Snow-Covered lands and spells like Skred ensure stability against aggressive decks while still maintaining card advantage."
