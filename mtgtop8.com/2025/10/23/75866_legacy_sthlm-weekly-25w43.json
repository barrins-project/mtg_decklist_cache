The deck uses mana acceleration sources like Ancient Tomb and Eldrazi Temple to quickly cast these creatures and disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Chalice of the Void and Wasteland. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Kozilek's Command and Glaring Fleshraker to control the board and maintain pressure on the opponent.Overall, this deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and quickly close out games with its aggressive Eldrazi creatures."
