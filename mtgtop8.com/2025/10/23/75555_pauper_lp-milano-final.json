It also includes ways to sacrifice creatures for benefits, like Bloodthrone Vampire and Village Rites, as well as ways to return creatures from the graveyard with cards like Unearth. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures while maintaining card advantage and versatility through sacrifice and recursion effects."
