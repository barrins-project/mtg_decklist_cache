By efficiently using card draw and cheap spells, the player aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast clock and disrupt their game plan. The deck also includes evasion and temporary removal to keep up the pressure and protect key threats. Overall, this deck relies on speed, tempo, and disruption to outmaneuver the opponent and secure victory in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
