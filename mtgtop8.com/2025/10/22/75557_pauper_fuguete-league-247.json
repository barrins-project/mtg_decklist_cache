This is achieved by combining efficient mana generation with creatures that can be sacrificed for various effects, along with card draw and recursion to maintain resources. The deck aims to outvalue opponents by overwhelming them with a combination of mana advantage, card advantage, and versatile removal spells, ultimately establishing board control and dictating the pace of the game."
