By combining cheap artifacts like Ornithopter and Mox Opal with payoff cards like Pinnacle Emissary and Emry, Lurker of the Loch, the deck can establish a board presence early and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays. The inclusion of cards like Engineered Explosives and Tormod's Crypt provides disruption against opposing strategies, while Urza's Saga offers additional artifact synergy and card advantage. The deck aims to outpace the opponent and secure victory through a relentless assault of artifact creatures and efficient spells."

The key strategy involves using cards like Devourer of Destiny and Glaring Fleshraker to sacrifice creatures and trigger powerful effects from Blade of the Bloodchief and Kozilek's Command. Emrakul, the Promised End serves as a game-winning threat, while the lands and artifacts provide consistent mana and card advantage. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful board presence and disruptive spells."

The deck aims to maintain board control with removal spells like Galvanic Discharge and Thraben Charm, while using efficient creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury to deal quick damage. The inclusion of blood moon and static prison disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Arena of Glory provides additional combat advantages. Overall, the deck focuses on fast, aggressive plays to secure victory."
