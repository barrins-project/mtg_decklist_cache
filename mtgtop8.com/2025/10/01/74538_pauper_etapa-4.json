Quirion Ranger and Birchlore Rangers provide flexibility and acceleration, while Wellwisher offers sustainability. Masked Vandal provides removal against opposing threats, while Vines of Vastwood protects key creatures. Winding Way and Lead the Stampede ensure a steady stream of creatures to maintain pressure on the opponent. With a strong focus on speed and aggression, this deck aims to overrun the opponent before they can stabilize."
