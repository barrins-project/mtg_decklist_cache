It makes use of disruptive cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Spirit of the Labyrinth to slow down the opponent's game plan. Stoneforge Mystic and equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Kaldra Compleat provide additional threats and utility. Aether Vial allows for creatures to be put into play at instant speed, keeping the pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes removal spells like Path to Exile and Swords to Plowshares to deal with opposing threats."
