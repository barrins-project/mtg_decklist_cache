The deck also includes cards like Fiery Impulse and Lightning Axe for removal, as well as Picklock Prankster for card advantage and protection. Additionally, the deck has some control elements with Into the Flood Maw and Torch the Tower to deal with threats. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast and consistent damage output while maintaining card advantage."
