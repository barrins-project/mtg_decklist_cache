Quirion Ranger and Birchlore Rangers provide additional mana and utility, while Priest of Titania can generate a significant amount of mana in the right circumstances. The deck also includes some card draw spells like Winding Way and Lead the Stampede to maintain resources and keep the pressure on the opponent. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of Elves and win the game quickly."
