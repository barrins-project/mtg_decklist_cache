By utilizing powerful reanimation spells, such as Animate Dead, the deck aims to cheat expensive creatures like Archon of Cruelty and Atraxa, Grand Unifier into play early in the game. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Thoughtseize to protect its combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Brainstorm and Ponder to ensure consistency and card selection."
