By pairing these creatures with spells like Mutagenic Growth, Lightning Bolt, and Berserk, the deck aims to deal damage swiftly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Mishra's Bauble and Land Grant help to maintain card advantage and ensure consistency in draws. Overall, the key strategy of this deck is to apply constant pressure and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
