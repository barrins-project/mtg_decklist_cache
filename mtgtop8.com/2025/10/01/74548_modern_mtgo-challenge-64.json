The deck also includes disruptive elements like Solitude and Ephemerate to protect its creatures and disrupt the opponent's game plan.

The deck aims to quickly apply pressure on the opponent and finish the game before they have a chance to stabilize. Cards like Galvanic Discharge and Goblin Bombardment provide additional damage and removal options, while cards like Arena of Glory and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker help maintain board control and provide extra value. Overall, this deck prioritizes fast, efficient aggression to overwhelm opponents."
