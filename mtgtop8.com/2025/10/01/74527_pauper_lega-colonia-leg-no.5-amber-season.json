By utilizing fast and inexpensive goblins along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Goblin Grenade, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. The inclusion of cards like Reckless Lackey and Goblin Bushwhacker help to boost the power of the goblin army, while cards like Fireblast and Highway Robbery provide additional reach to finish off the opponent. Overall, the strategy is to apply pressure early and maintain a fast tempo throughout the game."
