The deck also includes some higher-cost finishers like Phyrexian Dragon Engine and Omnivorous Flytrap to seal the deal in the late game. By combining efficient creatures with combat tricks, this deck aims to consistently put pressure on the opponent and secure victories."

By using cards like No More Lies and Stock Up to draw cards and maintain a hand advantage, while using counterspells like Negate to stop key spells from the opponent, the deck aims to slowly grind out a win by outvaluing the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Beza, the Bounding Spring and Marang River Regent provide additional threats and win conditions, while also providing some forms of control. The mana base is structured to allow for consistent and efficient spell casting."
