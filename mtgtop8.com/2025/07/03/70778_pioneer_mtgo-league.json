By using cards like Fatal Push, Thoughtseize, and Liliana of the Veil to control the board and disrupt the opponent's hand, the deck aims to gradually gain advantage and close out the game with threats like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Graveyard Trespasser. The deck also includes some removal options like Murderous Rider and Go for the Throat to deal with opposing threats, making it a potent control deck in Pioneer 1 vs 1 format."
