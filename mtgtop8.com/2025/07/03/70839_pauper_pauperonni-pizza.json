The key strategy is to swarm the board with artifact creatures like Myr Enforcer and Refurbished Familiar while using cards like Ichor Wellspring and Thoughtcast to draw more cards and keep the momentum going. By combining aggressive creatures with burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Krark-Clan Shaman, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient attacking strategy. The synergy between artifacts and creatures in this deck makes it a formidable aggro-affinity archetype in the Pauper format."
