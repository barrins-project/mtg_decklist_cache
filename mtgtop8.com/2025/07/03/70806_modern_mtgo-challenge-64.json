With the ability to cycle cards like Street Wraith and Endurance, the deck aims to control the board and overpower the opponent with its graveyard interactions. The key strategy is to cycle through the deck quickly, setting up for a powerful Living End play."

The inclusion of cards like Violent Urge and Slickshot Show-Off further enhances the deck's ability to quickly close out games by buffing creatures and bypassing blockers. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and relentless assault."

It also utilizes card draw and card selection to find key pieces of the strategy. The win condition revolves around generating value through card advantage with cards such as Narset, Parter of Veils and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, while using powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. The mana base is designed to consistently cast powerful spells while also providing some utility with cards like Field of Ruin and Geier Reach Sanitarium."
