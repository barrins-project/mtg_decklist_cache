The deck runs a number of ways to tutor for and protect these creatures, such as Eldritch Evolution, Neoform, and Pact of Negation. Generous Ent acts as a backup plan for finding combo pieces, while Planar Genesis can generate massive mana advantage for explosive plays. Overall, this deck aims to combo off quickly and efficiently to win the game before opponents can establish their own game plan."

It includes several ways to manipulate the graveyard and generate card advantage, allowing the player to quickly overwhelm their opponent with powerful creatures while disrupting their game plan. Additionally, there are options for counter magic to protect the combo and force through important spells. The deck aims to create a strong board presence and control the game until it can execute its game-winning combo."
