By combining powerful creatures like Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury and Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer with support cards like Galvanic Discharge and Goblin Bombardment, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board control throughout the game. Additionally, cards like Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Seasoned Pyromancer provide card advantage and utility, while cards like Voice of Victory and Static Prison help protect the board and secure victory. The deck also utilizes land disruption with Blood Moon and versatile lands like Arid Mesa and Flooded Strand to further disrupt the opponent's game plan."
