Agatha's Soul Cauldron and Winternight Stories also provide card advantage and help to maintain a strong board presence. The deck is designed to be fast-paced and punish opponents who are unable to keep up with its aggressive gameplay."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly casting low-cost spells to take control of the game early on. By utilizing a combination of card draw, direct damage, and aggressive creatures, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan. With a mix of burn spells, creatures with haste, and card advantage engines like Astrologian's Planisphere, the deck aims to maintain pressure while disrupting the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Obliterating Bolt and Ral, Crackling Wit can help secure a win if the game goes longer than expected."
