Ephemerate and Solitude offer additional removal options, and Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek disrupt the opponent's hand. Recruiter of the Guard helps find key pieces, while the mana base allows for flexibility in casting spells."

Leyline of the Guildpact protects your creatures and spells from opposing multicolored decks, while Leyline Binding can lock down threats. Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Territorial Kavu provide early aggression, while Scion of Draco and Cecil, Dark Knight offer powerful late-game threats. Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury can quickly close out games, and Arena of Glory provides additional support for your creatures. Be fast, be aggressive, and overwhelm your opponent with a versatile multicolored strategy."
