It also includes cards that can provide additional value through sacrificing creatures or returning them from the graveyard. The deck seeks to apply pressure early in the game and maintain that momentum to finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. With a mix of efficient creatures, removal spells, and disruptive elements, this deck aims to be a fast-paced and versatile threat on the battlefield."
