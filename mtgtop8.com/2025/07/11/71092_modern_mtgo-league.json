Shardless Agent and Generous Ent help to cascade into powerful creatures while Subtlety and Force of Negation provide control. Endurance can disrupt graveyard strategies, and Curator of Mysteries can help filter through the deck. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a massive board state after casting Living End, using creatures like Waker of Waves and Colossal Skyturtle to finish the game."
