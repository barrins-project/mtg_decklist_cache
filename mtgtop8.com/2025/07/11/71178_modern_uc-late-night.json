It also has spells like Kozilek's Command and Kozilek's Return to control the opponent's creatures. The deck utilizes cards like Ugin's Labyrinth and Malevolent Rumble to disrupt the opponent's strategy while building up its own board presence. Overall, the key concept is to ramp up mana, control the game with Eldrazi creatures and spells, and overpower the opponent."
