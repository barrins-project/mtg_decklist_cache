By quickly deploying creatures like Clockwork Percussionist and Goblin Tomb Raider, supported by efficient burn spells such as Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, the deck aims to deal damage swiftly and efficiently to secure victory. The inclusion of cards like Fireblast and Galvanic Blast further enhances the deck's ability to close out games quickly, making it a formidable Aggro - Red Deck Wins archetype in the format."
