The key strategy is to establish a board presence early with aggressive creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Ocelot Pride, while using burn spells like Galvanic Discharge and Goblin Bombardment to clear the way for attacks or finish off opponents. Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Arena of Glory provide additional support and buffs for the creatures, while Seasoned Pyromancer and Guide of Souls help with card advantage and maintaining pressure on the opponent."
