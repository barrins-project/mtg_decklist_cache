The key strategy revolves around using efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Thoughtseize to clear the way for powerful threats like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Bloodtithe Harvester. By combining targeted discard, removal, and creature threats, the deck aims to apply constant pressure to the opponent while limiting their ability to respond effectively. The land base also supports the deck's aggressive game plan, ensuring a smooth curve of threats and disruption."
