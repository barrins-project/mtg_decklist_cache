The deck also includes creatures that can generate additional value or threats, such as Murmuring Mystic and Tolarian Terror. The mana base includes snow-covered lands to support Skred and Volatile Fjord. Overall, the deck aims to stall the game, disrupt the opponent's plans, and eventually win through card advantage and efficient removal."
