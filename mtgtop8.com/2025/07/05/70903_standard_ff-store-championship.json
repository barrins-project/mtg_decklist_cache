            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to control the game through counterspells, removal, and card advantage. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by countering key spells, removing threats from the board, and drawing additional cards to maintain card advantage. By effectively controlling the tempo of the game and slowing down the opponent's game plan, this deck can establish dominance and eventually secure victory through its control-oriented strategy. The use of split cards and versatile spells allows for adaptability in different matchups, making it a formidable force in 1 vs 1 Standard format."
