Caretaker's Talent and Carrot Cake help with card advantage, while Beza, the Bounding Spring and Overlord of the Mistmoors provide solid threats. Enduring Innocence keeps the deck's resources up, while Demolition Field provides an extra removal option. The mana base is built around Plains, Sunken Citadel, and Fountainport to ensure consistency."
