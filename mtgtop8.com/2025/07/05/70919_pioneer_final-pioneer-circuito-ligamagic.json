With cards like Kumano Faces Kakkazan and Monstrous Rage providing additional damage output, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a flurry of aggressive creatures and burn spells. Utilizing key lands like Mutavault and Ramunap Ruins, as well as equipment like Shadowspear, this deck seeks to maintain pressure on the opponent and secure a quick victory."
