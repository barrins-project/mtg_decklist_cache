With a focus on countering spells, dealing damage, and card advantage through card draw and manipulation, the deck aims to establish board control and tempo advantage. The inclusion of creatures like Murmuring Mystic and Tolarian Terror allows for offensive pressure while still maintaining the control aspect. Overall, the deck seeks to dictate the pace of the game and outmaneuver opponents through strategic plays and resource management."
