The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of threats, while also disrupting their game plan with removal and disruption spells. The deck also includes ways to buff up its creatures and create advantageous board states, while also having a solid mana base to support its aggressive game plan. Ultimately, the deck aims to quickly close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
