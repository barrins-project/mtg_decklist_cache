Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of speed, efficiency, and resilience."

It aims to efficiently deal with threats while drawing cards and generating value with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Emet-Selch, Unsundered and Thundertrap Trainer to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's three-color requirements and to ensure consistency in casting spells."
