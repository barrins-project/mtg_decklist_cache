The deck aims to control the board with cards like Static Prison and Thraben Charm while utilizing the powerful planeswalkers Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury for additional value and pressure. The mana base is optimized for consistency and speed, allowing the deck to apply early pressure and finish the game decisively."
