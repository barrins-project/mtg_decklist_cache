By utilizing small creatures like Refurbished Familiar and Writhing Chrysalis, along with removal spells like Cast Down and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to control the board while consistently applying pressure. The inclusion of cards like Pulse of Murasa and Blood Fountain also allows for some life gain and recovery to keep up the tempo. Overall, the strategy is to maintain a fast and aggressive playstyle to outpace and defeat the opponent."
