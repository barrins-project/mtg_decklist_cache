The deck also aims to ramp up its mana with Bountiful Landscape and Volatile Fjord to cast powerful late-game spells like Writhing Chrysalis and Crimson Fleet Commodore. With a mix of removal, card draw, and counterspells, the UR Control deck seeks to control the game and outvalue the opponent in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
