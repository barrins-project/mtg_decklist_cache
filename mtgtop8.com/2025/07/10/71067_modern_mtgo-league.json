At the same time, you control the board with cards like Kozilek's Command and Malevolent Rumble, while also disrupting your opponent's strategy with cards like Sowing Mycospawn. With powerful late-game threats and strong control elements, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory through a combination of ramping and control tactics."
