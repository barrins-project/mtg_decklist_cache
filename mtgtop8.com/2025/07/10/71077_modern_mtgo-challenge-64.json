The deck also includes cards like Summoner's Pact and Aftermath Analyst to increase consistency and efficiency in executing the combo."

The deck utilizes cards like Lotus Bloom and Hydroelectric Specimen to ramp up mana production, while disruption cards like Disrupting Shoal and Stern Scolding help control the game until the combo can be assembled. The ultimate goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful board state and win the game in a single turn."
