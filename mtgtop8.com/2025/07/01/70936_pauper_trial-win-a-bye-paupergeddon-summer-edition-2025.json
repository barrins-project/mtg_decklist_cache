This is achieved through a combination of mana ramping cards like Expedition Map and Chromatic Star, as well as utility cards like Prophetic Prism and Ashnod's Altar. Additionally, the deck includes Artifact creatures like Myr Retriever and Pactdoll Terror, as well as card draw engines like Golem Foundry and Blood Fountain to outvalue the opponent."
