By utilizing cards like Opt, Sleight of Hand, and Astrologian's Planisphere to draw through the deck, the deck can consistently put pressure on the opponent. With aggressive creatures like Slickshot Show-Off and Vivi Ornitier, along with burn spells like Torch the Tower, the deck aims to control the board early on and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The deck also has some disruptive elements with cards like Magic Damper and Self-Destruct to further disrupt the opponent's game plan."
