By using Disrupting Shoal, Flare of Denial, and other counterspells to protect the combo pieces, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while progressing towards a game-ending play. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Jwari Disruption and Sink into Stupor helps control the opponent's board and slow down their strategy. Overall, this deck is designed to execute a fast and decisive win using a landless combo strategy."
