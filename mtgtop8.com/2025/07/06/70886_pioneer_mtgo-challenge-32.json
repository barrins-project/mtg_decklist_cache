The key strategy is to deal damage to the opponent's life total as quickly as possible using efficient creatures like Manifold Mouse and Emberheart Challenger, supported by powerful burn spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike. The deck also includes cards like Reckless Rage and Monstrous Rage to clear the opponent's blockers and push through damage. Overall, the goal is to maintain early pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The inclusion of cards like Artist's Talent and Picklock Prankster also allow for additional card draw and disruption to further support the aggressive game plan."
