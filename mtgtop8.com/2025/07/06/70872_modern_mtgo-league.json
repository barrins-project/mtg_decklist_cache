The ultimate goal is to assemble a combo using Goblin Charbelcher to deal massive damage to the opponent. The deck is designed to be aggressive and to disrupt the opponent's strategy, using cards like Fallaji Archaeologist and Stern Scolding. The deck emphasizes a fast-paced playstyle and aims to win the game before the opponent can establish a strong board presence."
