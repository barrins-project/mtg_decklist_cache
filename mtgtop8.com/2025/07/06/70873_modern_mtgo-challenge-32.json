It aims to quickly assemble the pieces needed for a strong combo finish, such as using Scapeshift to search for multiple lands and win the game in one turn. The deck also includes various utility lands to provide additional benefits and flexibility in different situations. Overall, the key concept is to efficiently ramp into big threats and quickly close out the game with powerful combos."

It relies on disruptive elements like Malevolent Rumble and Kozilek's Command to control the game while setting up the combo. The inclusion of Eldrazi creatures like Emrakul, the Promised End provides additional threats, with support from cards like Urza's Saga and Ancient Stirrings for consistency. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells, ultimately leading to a victory through a well-timed combo."
