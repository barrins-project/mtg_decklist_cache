By using cards like Goblin Charbelcher and Lotus Bloom in combination with Disrupting Shoal and Whir of Invention, the deck can quickly generate powerful effects and overwhelm the opponent. It also includes control elements like Spell Snare and Sink into Stupor to further disrupt the opponent's plans. The key strategy is to efficiently manage resources and timing to outplay the opponent and secure victory."
