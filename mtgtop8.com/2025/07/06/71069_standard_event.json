By combining the evasion of Faeries with the disruption of Spyglass Siren and Floodpits Drowner, the deck aims to quickly pressure the opponent while keeping their own board intact. Enduring Curiosity enables card draw to maintain momentum, while efficient removal like Go for the Throat and Cut Down deal with threats. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Cecil, Dark Knight and Kaito, Bane of Nightmares ensures a strong late-game presence to close out the match."
