            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing a combination of cards to generate card advantage and manipulate the graveyard, ultimately leading to a win condition of decking out the opponent or dealing damage with Malevolent Rumble. It utilizes artifacts and graveyard recursion to fuel its game plan, while also including disruptive elements like Engineered Explosives and Tormod's Crypt to control the board. The deck aims to out value opponents through card draw and recursion, while also having the potential to win quickly through its combo pieces."
