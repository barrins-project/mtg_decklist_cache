Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student and Vivi Ornitier provide additional card draw and tempo plays, while cards like Galvanic Blast and Flame of Anor act as finishers to close out the game. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its aggressive artifact-based strategy."

By combining various mill effects and disruption spells like Fatal Push and Surgical Extraction, you aim to quickly deplete your opponent's deck and win through deck out rather than traditional damage. With cards like Fractured Sanity and Tasha's Hideous Laughter providing even more mill power, the deck aims to control the game by limiting your opponent's resources while steadily progressing towards achieving a mill victory."
