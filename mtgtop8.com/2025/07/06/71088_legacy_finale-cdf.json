The deck also utilizes cards like Brainstorm and Ponder to filter through the deck and find the necessary combo pieces, making it a potent and efficient reanimator strategy in Legacy 1 vs 1 format."

Overall, the deck aims to combo off and overwhelm the opponent with big threats like Archon of Cruelty or Atraxa, Grand Unifier, while maintaining control over the game with counterspells and removal."
