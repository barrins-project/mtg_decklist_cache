Cards like Fiery Temper and Faithless Looting help to set up the combo by either discarding creatures or dealing damage to opponents. The deck also includes cards like Lotleth Giant and Stinkweed Imp to provide additional value when brought back from the graveyard. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with resurrected creatures and secure a victory."
