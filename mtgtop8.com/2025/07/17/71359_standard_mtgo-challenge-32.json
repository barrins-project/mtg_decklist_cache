It includes a variety of cheap spells for removal and damage, as well as creatures with abilities that can buff each other. The mana base is designed for consistent access to all colors needed for spell casting. The goal is to build a board presence quickly and maintain pressure on the opponent, while also having some flexibility for removal and control options."
