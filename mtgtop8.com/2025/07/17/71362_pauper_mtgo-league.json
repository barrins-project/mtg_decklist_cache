The Walls also provide protection while setting up the combo. The deck aims to draw through the deck quickly with Winding Way and Lead the Stampede to find the combo pieces. Land Grant helps with mana fixing and consistency in the deck. The win condition usually involves reanimating key combo pieces from the graveyard with Reaping the Graves to achieve a victory."
