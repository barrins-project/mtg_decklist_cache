It utilizes cards like Shuko and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student to facilitate the combo, while also packing disruptive spells like Daze and Force of Will to protect the combo. The deck also includes some utility cards like Swords to Plowshares and Urza's Saga to deal with threats and help assemble the combo faster."
