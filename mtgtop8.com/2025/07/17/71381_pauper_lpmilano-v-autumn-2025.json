Grab the Prize can help dig for combo pieces, while cards like Stinkweed Imp and Scrapwork Mutt can provide additional value when they hit the graveyard. The goal is to set up a big combo turn with the reanimated creatures to overwhelm the opponent and secure the win."

Cards like Boarding Party and Avenging Hunter put pressure on the opponent right away, while cards like Eldrazi Repurposer and Writhing Chrysalis provide additional value and flexibility. The goal is to maintain a fast, steady stream of threats to close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
