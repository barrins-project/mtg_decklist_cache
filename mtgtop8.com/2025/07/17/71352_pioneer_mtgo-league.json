The inclusion of Kaheera, the Orphanguard as a companion provides additional synergy and utility to the deck. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through incremental advantages and careful decision-making."

The deck also includes powerful finishers like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger to seal the deal. By combining fast creatures with removal spells and disruption, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The use of utility lands like Mutavault and Blazemire Verge adds versatility to the deck's mana base."

With cards like Sigarda's Aid and Portable Hole for support, the deck aims to pressure opponents early and overwhelm them with aggressive creatures such as Cloud, Midgar Mercenary and Kellan, the Fae-Blooded. The deck also focuses on mana consistency with a good mix of lands and mana sources."
