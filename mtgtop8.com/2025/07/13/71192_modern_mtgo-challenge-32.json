The deck also includes disruptive cards like Force of Negation and Subtlety to control the game while you set up the combo.

By ramping up mana with Mox Amber and Mox Opal, the deck can play multiple spells in a turn and overwhelm opponents with a mix of aggressive creatures and burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt. With Urza's Saga providing additional value and card advantage, the deck aims to close out games swiftly by leveraging its artifact synergy and explosive plays."
