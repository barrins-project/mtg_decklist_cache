The deck includes aggressive creatures like Bannerhide Krushok, Avenging Hunter, and Nyxborn Hydra to deal damage quickly. Writhing Chrysalis and Eldrazi Repurposer provide utility in generating tokens or refilling the hand. Malevolent Rumble adds removal to deal with opponent's threats. Overall, the deck aims to flood the board with powerful creatures and control the game tempo."
