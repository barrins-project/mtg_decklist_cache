The key strategy is to apply early pressure with efficient creatures like Bloodtithe Harvester and use discard spells like Duress and Thoughtseize to strip the opponent's hand of important cards. The deck also has a strong late-game presence with powerful threats like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger. The goal is to curve out smoothly while disrupting the opponent's game plan and finishing them off with a mix of creatures and burn spells."
