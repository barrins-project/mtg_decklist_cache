Emry, Lurker of the Loch is a key card that can recur artifacts from the graveyard, while cards like Mishra's Bauble and Thoughtcast provide card draw. Urza's Saga and Mox Opal are used to ramp up and quickly deploy threats such as Kappa Cannoneer and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student. Metallic Rebuke and Force of Negation offer disruption against opposing spells. The deck's efficiency and synergy with artifacts allows it to apply pressure and control the game tempo effectively."
