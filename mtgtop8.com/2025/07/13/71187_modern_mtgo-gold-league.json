The deck also includes control elements like Static Prison and Thraben Charm to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Arena of Glory provide extra buffs and utility, while Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and Voice of Victory offer win conditions. The mana base is designed for consistency and to support the aggressive game plan."
