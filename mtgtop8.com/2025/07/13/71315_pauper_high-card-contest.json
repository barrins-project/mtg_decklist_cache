The key strategy is to efficiently use spells like Counterspell and Force Spike to disrupt the opponent's plans, while also utilizing cards like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent to apply pressure and win the game as fast as possible. Thought Scour and Brainstorm help to filter draws and find the right spells at the right time, making it a versatile and lethal mono blue aggro deck."
