The deck aims to use cards like Counterspell, Dispel, and Snuff Out to counter or remove threats while using cards like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Thought Scour to dig for key cards. Lórien Revealed provides card draw and Unexpected Fangs can help stabilize the board. Gurmag Angler serves as a powerful threat to close out the game. Overall, the deck seeks to outvalue the opponent and control the game until it can take over and win."
