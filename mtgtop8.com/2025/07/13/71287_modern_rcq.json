By utilizing cheap and efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Dragon's Rage Channeler, along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Dart, the deck aims to deal damage early and often. Mishra's Bauble helps with card selection and triggering prowess abilities, while cards like Expressive Iteration and Preordain improve consistency. The deck's goal is to apply pressure from the start and maintain that aggression throughout the match."
