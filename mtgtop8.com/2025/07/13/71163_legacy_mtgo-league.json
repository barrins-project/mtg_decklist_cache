The deck also includes ways to tutor for key pieces and lock opponents out of the game with cards like Karn, the Great Creator and The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale. With a combination of ramp, disruption, and powerful threats, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents and establish a dominant board state quickly."
