The deck includes a mix of efficient creatures like Emberheart Challenger and Monastery Swiftspear, along with burn spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike to remove threats or go straight to the opponent's face. The inclusion of cards like Kumano Faces Kakkazan and Shadowspear provide additional reach and utility. The deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out the game as fast as possible."
