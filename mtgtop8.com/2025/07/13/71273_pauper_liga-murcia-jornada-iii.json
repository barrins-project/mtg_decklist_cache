The deck focuses on quickly ramping up mana with cards like Arbor Elf and Utopia Sprawl, allowing for casting powerful threats like Avenging Hunter and Nyxborn Hydra early in the game. With cards like Writhing Chrysalis and Jewel Thief, the deck can disrupt the opponent's game plan while gradually building up its own board presence. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
