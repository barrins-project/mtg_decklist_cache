By combining cards like First Day of Class and Ichor Wellspring with sacrifice outlets and card draw, the deck can quickly build up a powerful board state and overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and creatures. The goal is to set up a lethal combo turn where the player can deal a significant amount of damage or generate a massive advantage."
