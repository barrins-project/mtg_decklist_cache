It includes various ways to draw cards, counter spells, fog effects to stall, and recursion spells to reuse key cards. The deck also features a few creatures to block and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the goal is to outvalue the opponent through card advantage, control the board with spells and lands, and eventually win the game with a powerful finisher or by decking the opponent."

It includes cards that can summon multiple creatures at once and cards that can return creatures to the hand for repeated use. Additionally, it includes cards that can prevent damage to the player's creatures or provide additional benefits. The goal is to establish a strong board presence early in the game and keep up the pressure with cheap and efficient creatures."
