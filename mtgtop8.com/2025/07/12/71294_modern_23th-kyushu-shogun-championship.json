By using cards like Thoughtseize, Counterspell, Fatal Push, and Murktide Regent, the strategy is to keep the opponent on the back foot while slowly building up your own resources and advantage. Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student and Cecil, Dark Knight provide card advantage and flexibility, while Psychic Frog can be used for additional disruption. The deck also includes lands that provide mana fixing and card advantage to ensure consistency in executing its control strategy."
