The deck also includes cards that generate card advantage and provide additional tools for controlling the board. The mana base is carefully designed to support the deck's color requirements while also providing flexibility in mana sources. Overall, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence while slowly whittling down the opponent's resources until victory is achieved."
