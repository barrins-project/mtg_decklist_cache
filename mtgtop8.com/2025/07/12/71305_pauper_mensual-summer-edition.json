Cards like Fanatical Offering and Makeshift Munitions allow you to sac creatures for value, while cards like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt help control the board. The deck also includes ways to recur your creatures with cards like Glint Hawk and Kor Skyfisher. With a mix of removal, card draw, and creature recursion, this aggro deck aims to overwhelm opponents with efficient plays and incremental advantage."
