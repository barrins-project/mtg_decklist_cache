The deck also utilizes disruption with cards like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach to control the opponent's hand size. The synergy between the graveyard recursion and hand disruption creates a powerful combo strategy that aims to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures early in the game. The land base is focused on black mana sources to consistently cast the spells needed for the combo."
