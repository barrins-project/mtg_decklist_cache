The deck also utilizes cards like Unmask and Dauthi Voidwalker to disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up its own win condition. Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Boggart Trawler are key pieces in the combo, allowing the player to bring back creatures from the graveyard and continue the assault. Shadow of Mortality provides additional reach and consistency to the deck."
