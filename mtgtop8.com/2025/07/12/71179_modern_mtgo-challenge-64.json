Emry, Lurker of the Loch, Mishra's Bauble, and Mox Opal provide card advantage and mana acceleration, while cards like Thoughtcast and Metallic Rebuke ensure smooth card draw and disruption. Urza's Saga and Spire of Industry further enhance the artifact theme, allowing for explosive starts and a variety of threats. The goal is to establish a dominating board state early in the game and maintain pressure to secure a fast victory."
