Cards like Vivisurgeon's Insight, Prologue to Phyresis, and Infectious Inquiry help to add poison counters, while Steady Progress and Contentious Plan ensure that the deck is consistently drawing cards. Mana ramp is achieved through cards like Pentad Prism and Lotus Petal, allowing for faster plays and more explosive turns. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with poison counters before they have a chance to react."
