The key strategy is to quickly develop a board presence with efficient creatures like Llanowar Elves and Pawpatch Recruit, while using cards like Get Lost and Restless Prairie to disrupt the opponent's plans. Elspeth, Storm Slayer and Brightglass Gearhulk provide powerful finishers, while cards like Sanguine Evangelist and Nurturing Pixie help maintain card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to pressure the opponent early and maintain control of the battlefield throughout the game."
