It aims to slow down the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage and value with cards like Elspeth, Storm Slayer and Yorion, Sky Nomad. The use of mono white cards prioritizes efficient removal and protection for key threats, while also providing resilient threats like Beza, the Bounding Spring. The mana base is optimized to support the deck's strategies and ensure consistent mana production throughout the game."
