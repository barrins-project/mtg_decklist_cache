With key cards like Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and Archon of Emeria, you can disrupt your opponent's game plan while pushing your own agenda. Armageddon allows you to reset the board and maintain your advantage, while cards like Deafening Silence and Sheltered by Ghosts protect your creatures and keep your opponent on the back foot."
