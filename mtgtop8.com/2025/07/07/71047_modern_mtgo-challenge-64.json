The deck also focuses on graveyard synergies with cards like Cling to Dust and Unearth. The win conditions include big flying threats like Murktide Regent and Harbinger of the Seas, as well as card advantage engines like Meticulous Archive. The mana base is designed to support the dual-colored nature of the deck, with lands like Polluted Delta and Watery Grave."

The deck also includes utility lands like Vesuva and Mirrorpool to further enhance its combo potential."
