The deck also includes burn spells like Galvanic Discharge and Goblin Bombardment to control the board and finish off opponents. The inclusion of Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury and Ajani, Nacatl Pariah adds powerful late-game threats. The main strategy is to apply constant pressure with fast creatures and burn spells, while also having some control elements to disrupt the opponent's plans."
