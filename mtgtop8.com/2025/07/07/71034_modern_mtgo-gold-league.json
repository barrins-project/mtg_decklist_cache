By utilizing lands such as Scapeshift and Simic Growth Chamber, the deck aims to generate massive amounts of mana and overwhelm the opponent with Primeval Titan's powerful abilities. The deck also includes utility lands like Boseiju, Who Endures and Lotus Field to further support the combo strategy. Overall, the main goal is to assemble the combo pieces and quickly close out the game with powerful Titan plays."
