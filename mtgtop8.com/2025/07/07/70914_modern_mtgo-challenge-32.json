Crucible of Worlds allows for recurring land destruction, while Karn, the Great Creator provides utility and answers to problematic artifacts. The deck utilizes a mix of control elements to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent in a one-on-one matchup."

The inclusion of cards like Murktide Regent and Harbinger of the Seas provides additional threats that can quickly close out the game if left unchecked.

By playing low-cost artifacts and controlling the board with removal spells like Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and efficient plays. Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student also provides card advantage and potential card selection, while cards like Mishra's Bauble help with digging through the deck for key pieces. The deck's strength lies in its ability to rapidly build a threatening board presence and apply pressure on the opponent."
