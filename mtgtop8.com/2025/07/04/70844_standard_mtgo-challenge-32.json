Once Omniscience is in play, you can easily cast multiple big spells for free, such as Roiling Dragonstorm, Floodfarm Verge, and Repair and Recharge. By combining these spells with other cards like Overlord of the Floodpits and Fallaji Archaeologist, you can overwhelm your opponent with powerful combos and win the game quickly. Efficiently managing your resources and maintaining control of the board are key strategies for success with this deck."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on using low-cost creatures and removal spells to quickly control the board and deal damage to the opponent. The key strategy is to consistently apply pressure with aggressive creatures like Faerie Mastermind and Floodpits Drowner while using removal spells like Go for the Throat to eliminate threats. Enduring Curiosity allows for card draw to maintain resources, and key finishers like Kaito, Bane of Nightmares and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse can close out the game. The deck aims to maintain board dominance and chip away at the opponent's life total until victory is achieved."
