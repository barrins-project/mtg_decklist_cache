Planar Genesis and Consign to Memory provide additional utility and card advantage to ensure the deck runs smoothly and efficiently."

By utilizing a mix of countermagic, creature recursion, and mana ramp, the deck aims to quickly set up an explosive win condition with cards like Goblin Charbelcher or Thundertrap Trainer. The deck's focus is on efficiency and versatility, using a combination of disruptive and offensive spells to control the game and secure a victory through a well-timed combo."
