The deck aims to maintain a quick pace by utilizing fast mana sources like Great Furnace and Lava Dart, while also taking advantage of card draw with Reckless Impulse. Combining both creature pressure and direct damage, this Aggro - Red Deck Wins archetype aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total before they can stabilize."
