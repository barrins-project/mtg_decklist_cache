By utilizing card advantage with cantrips and Ninjutsu abilities, the deck aims to maintain board presence and tempo. Counterspells are used to protect the creatures and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck's aggressive strategy is further enhanced by evasion abilities and cheap removal options. The goal is to apply early pressure, control the board, and continually chip away at the opponent's life total to secure victory."
