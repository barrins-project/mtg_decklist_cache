By utilizing cards that provide additional value, such as Trostani, Three Whispers and Interface Ace, the deck aims to maintain board presence and press the advantage. The deck also includes ramp cards like Llanowar Elves to accelerate mana production and allow for powerful plays earlier in the game. Overall, the goal of this Selesnya Aggro deck is to apply consistent pressure and close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
