It includes cards like Birthing Ritual, Gilded Goose, and Chord of Calling to ramp up and tutor for key pieces. The toolbox aspect comes from being able to search for specific creatures like Samwise Gamgee, Skyclave Apparition, and Viscera Seer to deal with different threats or advance the game plan. The deck aims to control the board, generate incremental advantage, and eventually assemble a game-winning combo."
