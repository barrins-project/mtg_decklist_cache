The goal is to control the game until the late game where it can deploy powerful finishers like Elspeth, Storm Slayer and Urabrask's Forge to secure victory. The deck also relies on cards like Split Up and Caretaker's Talent to disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain dominance on the battlefield. With a mix of removal, creatures, and disruption, this deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a prolonged battle of attrition."
