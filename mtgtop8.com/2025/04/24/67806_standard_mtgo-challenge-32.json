It relies on a combination of low-cost creatures with abilities that disrupt the opponent's strategy, along with spells that provide additional support and removal options. By maintaining a steady stream of threats and disruption, the deck aims to maintain control of the tempo and prevent the opponent from stabilizing or mounting a defense. The key to success lies in maintaining pressure and capitalizing on the opponent's weaknesses while leveraging the deck's versatile spell options."
