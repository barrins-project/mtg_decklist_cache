It includes cards that can remove threats from the board, prevent the opponent from casting spells, and generate card advantage. The deck also includes powerful creatures that can dominate the battlefield once control has been established. The mana base is designed to provide a balanced mix of colors to ensure that the player can cast their spells consistently. Overall, the strategy is to outlast the opponent by disrupting their game plan and seizing control of the game."
