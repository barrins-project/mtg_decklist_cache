This is accomplished through a mix of removal spells, hand disruption, and powerful creatures like Liliana of the Veil and Archfiend of the Dross. The deck also includes cards that provide card advantage and life gain to outvalue the opponent. By slowing down the opponent's game plan and generating incremental advantage, this deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent to secure victory."
