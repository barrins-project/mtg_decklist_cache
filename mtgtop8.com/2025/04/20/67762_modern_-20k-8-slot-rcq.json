The deck aims to outvalue the opponent with powerful threats like Murktide Regent and Kaito, Bane of Nightmares, while maintaining a strong defensive position with efficient removal spells and card draw options. By carefully managing resources and controlling the pace of the game, the Dimir Control deck can outlast opponents and secure victory through incremental advantage."

With powerful threats like Emrakul, the Promised End and Ugin, the Eye of the Storms, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly. Cards like Malevolent Rumble and Kozilek's Command help to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also providing additional value. The deck also includes cards like World Breaker and Sowing Mycospawn to deal with specific threats. By ramping into big threats early and controlling the board, the deck looks to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents in a 1 vs 1 setting in the Modern format."
