Additionally, cards like Spell Pierce and This Town Ain't Big Enough help to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect your own creatures."

With a mix of creature removal, burn spells, and counter magic, the deck aims to maintain board control and outvalue the opponent. Cards like Jeskai Revelation and Stock Up help the player generate card advantage, while cards like Get Lost and Temporary Lockdown disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also includes some win conditions like Shiko, Paragon of the Way and Marang River Regent to close out the game once the opponent is sufficiently locked down."
