            "notes": "The deck focuses on using a combination of counter spells, removal spells, and card draw to control the game and disrupt the opponent's strategy. By efficiently managing resources and answering threats, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's game plan while generating value through cards like Tolarian Terror and Murmuring Mystic. With a mix of burn spells like Lightning Bolt and efficient removal like Skred, the deck can easily handle threats on the board. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Azure Fleet Admiral and Crimson Fleet Commodore help close out games once the opponent has been locked down."
