By using cards like Cathartic Reunion and Burning Inquiry to dig through the deck and Faithless Looting to discard cards, the deck aims to bring back creatures from the graveyard to overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of Creeping Chill provides additional reach and life gain. The deck also utilizes Lava Dart and Darkblast for removal and protection."
