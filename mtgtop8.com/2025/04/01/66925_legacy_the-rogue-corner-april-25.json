The deck utilizes disruptive cards like Force of Will and Force of Negation to protect its own game plan, while also utilizing Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's mana base. The deck also includes powerful creatures like Gilded Drake and Hullbreacher to apply pressure and control the board. Additionally, cards like Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student and Lórien Revealed provide card advantage and selection to ensure the deck can maintain its tempo advantage."
