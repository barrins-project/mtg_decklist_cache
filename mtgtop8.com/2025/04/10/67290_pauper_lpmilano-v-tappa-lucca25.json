The deck aims to control the board early on and then transition into a more aggressive stance to finish off the opponent. By using a mix of burn spells, efficient creatures, and artifacts, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent and secure a victory. Additionally, the deck features lands that can provide additional value by sacrificing artifacts for extra effects."
