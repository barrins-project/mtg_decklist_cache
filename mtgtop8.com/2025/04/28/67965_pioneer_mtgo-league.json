It combines efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and disruption effects like Thoughtseize to control the game until the combo can be assembled. Thundering Broodwagon and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker provide additional threats and ways to generate value. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's mana requirements and ensure consistent casting of its key cards. Overall, the deck focuses on executing its combo plan efficiently and disrupting the opponent's strategy."
