By playing cards that lock down your opponent's resources and limit their options, you can maintain dominance on the battlefield while building up your own army of creatures. The key strategy is to outmaneuver your opponent, gradually wearing them down until you can deliver a decisive blow and claim victory. This deck requires careful planning and strategic decision-making to effectively control the flow of the game and emerge triumphant."
