The inclusion of Clockwork Percussionist and Wrenn's Resolve helps to ensure a consistent flow of damaging spells, while cards like Voldaren Epicure and Goblin Tomb Raider provide additional threats on the board. The deck's mana base consists primarily of Mountains and Great Furnace to ensure fast and consistent access to red mana sources."

By utilizing cards that produce mana quickly and efficiently, along with powerful elf creatures, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and pressure the opponent. The deck also includes cards that can draw additional creatures to maintain momentum. With a low mana curve and high creature count, the deck aims to consistently apply pressure and win the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
