The inclusion of card draw and filtering spells like Brainstorm, Thought Scour, and Ponder helps maintain card advantage and increase the chances of drawing into key threats. Sleep of the Dead provides a win condition by tapping down the opponent's creatures for a final aggressive push."

The archetype is centered around putting pressure on the opponent and closing out the game quickly. By utilizing low-cost creatures and removal spells, the deck aims to control the board and keep the opponent on the defensive. The aggressive nature of the Rakdos Aggro archetype allows for a fast-paced and proactive playstyle, putting the opponent on the back foot from the start."
