Additionally, it includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Claim the Firstborn to control the board and Scavenger's Talent to disrupt the opponent's hand. The key strategy is to pressure the opponent with aggressive creatures and incremental value from sacrificing creatures to win the game quickly."
