The deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently, utilizing cards like Mutagenic Growth and Violent Urge to push through blockers and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The key strategy is to efficiently utilize low-cost creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Guide of Souls to deal damage early on, while also using burn spells like Galvanic Discharge and Goblin Bombardment to finish off the opponent. The inclusion of powerful cards like Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury and Ajani, Nacatl Pariah provides additional threats and ways to push through damage. The deck aims to maintain pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

By tutoring creatures with Chord of Calling and using sacrifice outlets like Viscera Seer and Carrion Feeder, the deck can create loops with Cauldron Familiar and Yawgmoth, Thran Physician for incremental advantage or close out the game with Marionette Apprentice. The toolbox nature of the deck allows for flexibility in responding to different situations and adapting to various matchups."

By using powerful creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury, along with support cards like Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Goblin Bombardment, the deck aims to deal damage fast and efficiently. The inclusion of control elements like Static Prison and Thraben Charm helps to disrupt the opponent's strategy while continuing to apply pressure. Additionally, the versatile land base allows for consistent mana access to keep up the aggressive gameplay."
