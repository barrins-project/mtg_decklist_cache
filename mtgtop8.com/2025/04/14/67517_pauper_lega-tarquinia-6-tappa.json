It aims to maintain card advantage through cards like Thought Scour and Deep Analysis, while also providing a small amount of card selection with Ponder and Brainstorm. The win condition is to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells in order to secure victory in a fast-paced 1 vs 1 Pauper game."
