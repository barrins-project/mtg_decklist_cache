By combining efficient creatures like Abhorrent Oculus and Glacial Dragonhunt with burn spells like Torch the Tower and Fear of Missing Out, the deck aims to establish early dominance and push for a fast victory. Additionally, cards like Profit's Eidetic Memory and Spyglass Siren provide card advantage and disruption to further support the aggressive game plan. The mana base ensures consistent access to all three colors for optimal play."

With a heavy emphasis on attacking early and often, the deck aims to close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Soulstone Sanctuary and Tersa Lightshatter provides some additional staying power and resilience against removal."
