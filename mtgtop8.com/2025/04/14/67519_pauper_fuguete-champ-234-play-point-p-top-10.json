            "notes": "The main concept of this Mono Black Aggro deck is to overwhelm the opponent with low-cost creatures like Mortician Beetle, Shambling Ghast, and Nested Shambler. By utilizing cards like Village Rites and Corrupted Conviction, the deck aims to maintain card advantage and pump up its creatures to deal quick and efficient damage. The inclusion of cards like Infestation Sage and Carrion Feeder helps in controlling the board and gaining incremental advantages over time. The deck also features some graveyard recursion with Unearth and Ghoulcaller's Chant, ensuring a steady stream of threats for the opponent to deal with."
