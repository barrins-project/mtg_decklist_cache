By playing efficient threats like Kytheon, Hero of Akros and Mantis Rider, supported by disruptive cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Reflector Mage, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on. Collected Company allows the deck to find more creatures and potentially flood the board with even more threats. With a mix of aggro and disruptive elements, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
