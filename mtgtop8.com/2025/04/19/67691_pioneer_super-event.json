The deck also utilizes Leyline of the Guildpact to create a strong devotion to green, maximizing the potential of cards like Polukranos Reborn and Ulvenwald Oddity. Storm the Festival is used to search for more creatures and Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner helps to draw cards and untap mana sources. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and strong board presence."
