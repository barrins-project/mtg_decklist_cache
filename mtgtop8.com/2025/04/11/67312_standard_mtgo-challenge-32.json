By combining creatures with abilities like unblockable or flying with removal spells and disruptive spells like Phantom Interference and Spyglass Siren, the deck aims to apply pressure early and often. With a mix of aggressive creatures and controlling spells, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize, leading to a swift victory."
