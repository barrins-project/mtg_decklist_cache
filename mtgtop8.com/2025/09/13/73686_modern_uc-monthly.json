It utilizes cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Dragon's Rage Channeler to apply pressure early on, backed up by Lightning Bolt and Lava Dart for cheap removal and reach. Violent Urge and Mutagenic Growth provide additional ways to pump up creatures for a strong alpha strike. The deck aims to efficiently close out games before opponents have a chance to stabilize, leveraging both aggressive creatures and burn spells to keep opponents on the back foot."
