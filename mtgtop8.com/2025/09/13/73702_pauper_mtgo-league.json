By ramping up mana quickly, the deck can quickly cast powerful spells like Valakut Invoker to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent. Lead the Stampede helps to refill the hand with more creatures, while cards like Generous Ent and Shield-Wall Sentinel provide additional benefits for having walls in play. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a massive army of creatures and overwhelming mana advantage."

Ultimately, the goal is to outlast and outplay the opponent to secure a victory."
