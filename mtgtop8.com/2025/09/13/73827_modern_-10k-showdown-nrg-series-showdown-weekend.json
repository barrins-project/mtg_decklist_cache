These artifacts are then used to power up creatures like Kappa Cannoneer and Thought Monitor. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of artifact creatures and equipment like Cranial Plating and Shadowspear, while using cards like Metallic Rebuke and Urza's Saga to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to win through fast and aggressive gameplay with the support of powerful artifact synergies."
