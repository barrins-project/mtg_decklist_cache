The deck aims to keep up the pressure by playing multiple creatures each turn and finishing off the opponent with a combination of creature damage and burn spells. The deck's strategy is to establish an early board presence and maintain pressure throughout the game, forcing the opponent to react defensively or risk being overwhelmed by the aggressive onslaught."
