The deck also includes disruptive elements like Force of Negation and Jwari Disruption to protect the combo. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Tameshi, Reality Architect and Waterlogged Teachings provides additional utility and card advantage to help the deck achieve its goal efficiently."

It also includes cards like Archive Trap and Fractured Sanity to further accelerate the milling process. Control elements like Drown in the Loch and Fatal Push help to protect against threats while Tasha's Hideous Laughter can exile a large portion of the opponent's library at once. The goal is to mill the opponent's entire deck as quickly as possible to win the game through decking out, while also disrupting their game plan with removal and control spells."
