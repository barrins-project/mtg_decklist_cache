Using cards like Azure Beastbinder and Floodpits Drowner to quickly build a board presence, while also using spells like Spell Pierce and Tragic Trajectory to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Kaito, Bane of Nightmares and Lord Skitter, Sewer King adds another level of threat to the deck. By maintaining a balance between aggression and disruption, this Dimir Aggro deck is designed to overwhelm opponents and secure victories."
