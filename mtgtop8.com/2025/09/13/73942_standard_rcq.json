By combining efficient creature spells with removal and combat tricks like Primal Might and Triumphant Chomp, the deck aims to maintain a strong board presence and apply pressure to the opponent. Llanowar Elves and Commercial District help ramp up mana production to cast the higher cost creatures, while Cavern of Souls provides protection against counter spells. Overall, the deck is designed to deliver fast and powerful creature-based aggression."
