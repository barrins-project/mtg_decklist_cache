By playing high-impact cards like Agatha's Soul Cauldron and Fear of Missing Out, along with versatile creatures such as Steamcore Scholar and Marauding Mako, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain that pressure throughout the game. Additionally, cards like Thundering Falls and Soulstone Sanctuary provide additional utility and protection to the deck's game plan."
