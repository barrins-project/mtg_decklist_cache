The deck also features some land utility with cards like Ramunap Ruins and Mutavault, providing additional reach and versatility in combat. The key strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out the game before they can stabilize."

The deck's win condition likely involves stabilizing the board with sweepers like Supreme Verdict and establishing a dominant board presence with powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. Overall, the deck seeks to outlast and outvalue opponents in a slower, grindy game."
