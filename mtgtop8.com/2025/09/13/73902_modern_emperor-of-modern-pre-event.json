It then uses cards like Surgical Extraction and Fractured Sanity to permanently remove key cards from the opponent's graveyard, disrupting their game plan. Tasha's Hideous Laughter serves as a finisher by exiling all cards from the opponent's library once a certain threshold is reached. The deck also includes control elements like Fatal Push and Spell Snare to deal with threats and protect the combo."
