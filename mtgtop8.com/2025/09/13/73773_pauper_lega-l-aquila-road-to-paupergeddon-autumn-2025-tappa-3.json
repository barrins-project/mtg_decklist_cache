The deck focuses on utilizing artifacts like Myr Enforcer and Gearseeker Serpent to establish a strong board presence and finish off the opponent with burn spells like Galvanic Blast. The deck also includes cards that can draw additional cards and generate mana to maintain the pressure. The synergy between the artifacts and burn spells is key to overwhelming the opponent."
