Using cards like Whir of Invention and Thundertrap Trainer, the deck aims to quickly ramp up to play key pieces like Goblin Charbelcher and Tameshi, Reality Architect. Cards like Disrupting Shoal and Stern Scolding are used for disruption while Lotus Bloom helps with mana acceleration. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful combo before they have a chance to establish board presence."
