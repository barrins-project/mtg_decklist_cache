            "notes": "The focus of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with small, efficient creatures and disruptive spells while maintaining card advantage through card draw and selection. By cycling through the deck quickly with cards like Thought Scour and Mental Note, the player aims to control the game tempo and protect their creatures with counterspells and bounce effects like Sleep of the Dead. The win condition is to chip away at the opponent's life total with evasive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent while keeping the opponent on the back foot."
