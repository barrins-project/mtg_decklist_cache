The deck focuses on using cards like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement to generate large amounts of mana, while also using cards like Galvanic Alchemist and Freed from the Real to create infinite mana loops. By combining these elements, the player can overwhelm their opponent with a massive amount of resources and card advantage to secure victory."
