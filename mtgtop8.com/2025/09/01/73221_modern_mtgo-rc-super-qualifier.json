The key strategy involves using cards like Lotus Bloom and Goblin Charbelcher to generate massive amounts of damage in a single turn, while also using disruptive cards like Disrupting Shoal and Stern Scolding to protect the combo. The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to react."

By utilizing cards like Jwari Disruption and Sink into Stupor, the deck aims to control the board while gradually building up resources. The key strategy involves using cards like Goblin Charbelcher and Lotus Bloom to combo off and deal massive damage to the opponent in a single turn. The deck also includes counter spells like Force of Negation and Spell Snare to protect its key combo pieces."
