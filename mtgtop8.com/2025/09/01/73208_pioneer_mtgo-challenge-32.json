It also includes protection and disruption elements like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push to control the game while building towards the combo finish. The deck aims to set up its combo pieces efficiently and protect them until it can launch a game-winning attack, combining synergy and disruption to create a strong and consistent strategy."
