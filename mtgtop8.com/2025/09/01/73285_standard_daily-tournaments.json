The strategy revolves around quickly establishing a board presence with creatures like Steamcore Scholar and Marauding Mako, while keeping the opponent on the back foot with removal spells like Abrade and Into the Flood Maw. The deck also utilizes card draw and recursion with cards like Vivi Ornitier and Prophet's Eidetic Memory to maintain momentum and overwhelm the opponent. By leveraging the aggressive nature of the UR aggro archetype, this deck aims to secure victory swiftly and decisively."
