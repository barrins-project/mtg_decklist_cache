The deck focuses on utilizing cards like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer, Guide of Souls, and Seasoned Pyromancer to quickly build a board presence and deal damage quickly. Additionally, cards like Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Haliya, Guided by Light provide additional support and synergy with the other aggressive creatures in the deck.
