With cards like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Legion Extruder, the deck aims to pressure the opponent early on and finish the game with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Shrapnel Blast. The inclusion of Urza's Saga and Mishra's Bauble helps generate extra value and card advantage. The deck also has tools like Sundering Eruption and Nettlecyst to deal with opposing threats, making it a fast and aggressive force in the format."
