Thoughtseize, Daze, and Force of Will are used to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Fatal Push and Nihil Spellbomb deal with threats on the board. The deck also utilizes card selection and card advantage through Ponder, Brainstorm, and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student. The mana base is streamlined for consistency, with a mix of fetch lands and dual lands to support the deck's aggressive tempo strategy."
