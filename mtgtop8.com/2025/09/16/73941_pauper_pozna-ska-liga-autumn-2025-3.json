It pairs these creatures with efficient removal spells like Skred and Lightning Bolt to control the board and protect its threats. Counterspell and Spell Pierce are used to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Ponder and Brainstorm help smooth out draws and find key cards. The deck also utilizes a snow-covered mana base for synergy with L√≥rien Revealed and Perilous Landscape to generate card advantage and ensure consistent colored mana sources."
