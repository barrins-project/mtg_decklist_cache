By quickly deploying threats and maintaining pressure on the opponent, the goal is to maximize damage output and secure a swift victory before the opponent can stabilize or turn the game around. With a focus on burn spells and efficient creatures, this deck aims to quickly bring the opponent's life total to zero while efficiently managing resources and maintaining board control."
