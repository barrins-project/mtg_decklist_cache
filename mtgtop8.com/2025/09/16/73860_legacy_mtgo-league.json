The deck also includes disruption spells like Force of Will and Thoughtseize to protect the combo pieces and counter opponent's plays. The deck aims to outpace the opponent by using powerful reanimation spells and control elements to secure victory. The key strategy is to efficiently reanimate high-impact creatures to overwhelm the opponent and secure a win."
