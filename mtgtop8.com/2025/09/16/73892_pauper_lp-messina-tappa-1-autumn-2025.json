By sacrificing artifacts like Ichor Wellspring and Blood Fountain, the deck can draw cards and generate additional value. Galvanic Blast provides reach and removal, while Reckoner's Bargain offers card advantage. The deck also includes some disruption with Krark-Clan Shaman and Toxin Analysis. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient artifact-based strategy."

The goal is to play Balustrade Spy to mill the entire deck, then use Dread Return to bring back Lotleth Giant or Sagu Wildling for a big finish. The deck also includes disruption with Mesmeric Fiend and Masked Vandal to control the board and protect the combo. This deck aims to win the game in a single explosive turn."
