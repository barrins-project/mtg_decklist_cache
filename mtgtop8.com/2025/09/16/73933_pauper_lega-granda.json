By utilizing artifacts and creatures with enter-the-battlefield effects, the deck aims to apply pressure early on while disrupting the opponent's game plan. The mana base is designed to support a fast and consistent curve, enabling the player to smoothly transition from early aggression to a mid-game advantage."
