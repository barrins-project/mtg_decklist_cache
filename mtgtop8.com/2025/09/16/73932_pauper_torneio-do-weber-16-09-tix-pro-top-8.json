The spells in the deck provide control and tempo advantage, allowing the player to keep the pressure on while protecting their own creatures. The synergy between the creatures and spells make this deck a formidable force in the early game, aiming to close out the match before the opponent can stabilize."

Village Rites and Perigee Beckoner help draw cards and maintain card advantage, while cards like Corrupted Conviction and Supernatural Stamina provide additional combat tricks and protection for key creatures.

By enchanting creatures like Slippery Bogle and Gladecover Scout with cards such as Ethereal Armor and Rancor, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with high-powered, evasive threats. The enchantments not only buff the creatures, but also provide additional benefits such as drawing cards and gaining life. With a mix of auras, creature protection, and mana ramp, this deck can quickly close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
