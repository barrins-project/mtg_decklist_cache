By disrupting the opponent's game plan and drawing cards to fuel its own, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and eventually win through card advantage or efficient threats like Murmuring Mystic and Thorn of the Black Rose. With a mix of creature removal, counterspells, and card draw spells, the deck can adapt to different matchups and make it difficult for the opponent to establish a strong board presence."
