Cards like Overgrown Battlement and Axebane Guardian help ramp up your mana production, while cards like Wall of Roots and Saruli Caretaker provide early defense. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help dig for key combo pieces, while Lotus Petal and Land Grant provide additional ramp and mana fixing."
