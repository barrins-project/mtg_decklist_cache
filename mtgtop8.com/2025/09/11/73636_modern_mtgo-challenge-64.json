The deck also focuses on disruption through cards like Metallic Rebuke and Galvanic Blast. Emry, Lurker of the Loch provides recursion for artifacts in the graveyard, while cards like Mox Opal and Mox Amber help accelerate the deck's mana base. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient plays and a strong artifact synergy."
