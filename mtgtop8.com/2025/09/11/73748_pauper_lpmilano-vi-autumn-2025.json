Once the pieces are in the graveyard, you can use Dread Return to reanimate a powerful creature, such as Lotleth Giant, for a game-winning combo. The deck also utilizes mana acceleration with cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Wall of Roots to quickly ramp into your combo pieces. The strategy is to quickly assemble the combo and overwhelm your opponent before they can react."
