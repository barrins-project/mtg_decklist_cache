Using cards like Bonecrusher Giant, Kumano Faces Kakkazan, and Emberheart Challenger, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. With a mix of creatures, burn spells, and land destruction, the deck applies constant pressure and forces the opponent to react quickly or risk being overrun. The inclusion of cards like Reckless Rage and Monstrous Rage give the deck additional flexibility and removal options."
