By playing a low curve of creatures and disruption, you aim to establish early board dominance and maintain pressure throughout the game. The inclusion of cards like Cecil, Dark Knight and Unstoppable Slasher allows for consistent damage output, while cards like Duress and Archenemy's Charm provide disruption and control options. Overall, the deck aims to win through a steady stream of damage and efficient removal spells, taking advantage of its aggressive game plan."

The burn spells provide direct damage to the opponent or removal for their creatures, allowing for a clear path to victory. This deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize and mount a defense."
