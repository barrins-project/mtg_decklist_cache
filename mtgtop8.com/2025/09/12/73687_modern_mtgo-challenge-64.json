This combo involves generating a large amount of mana with cards like Lotus Bloom and casting Goblin Charbelcher to deal lethal damage to your opponent. The deck also includes ways to protect the combo with counterspells and disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Sink into Stupor. The deck focuses on quickly executing its game plan and overwhelming the opponent with powerful combo turns."
