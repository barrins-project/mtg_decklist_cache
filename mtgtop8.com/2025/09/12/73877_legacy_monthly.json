Additionally, cards like Mox Diamond and Once Upon a Time help to accelerate the deck's game plan, while disruptive cards like Wasteland and Pithing Needle further hinder the opponent's strategy."

The inclusion of cards like Force of Will and Swords to Plowshares provide additional tools for dealing with threats, while Prismatic Ending offers versatile removal options. Mystic Sanctuary and Flooded Strand help ensure consistent access to key cards."
