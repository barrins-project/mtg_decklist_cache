By playing creatures like Temur Battlecrier and Railway Brawler, combined with cards like Abrade and Devastating Onslaught, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and limit the opponent's options. The deck also utilizes mana ramp creatures like Llanowar Elves to accelerate its game plan and ensure a consistent flow of threats. Ultimately, the goal is to quickly beat down the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
