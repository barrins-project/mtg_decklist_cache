By efficiently casting spells such as Myr Enforcer and Steelfin Whale, the deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent early in the game. The inclusion of cards like Metallic Rebuke and Retraction Helix provides some control elements to disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a mix of creatures, artifacts, and spells, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy while maintaining some versatility in its gameplay."
