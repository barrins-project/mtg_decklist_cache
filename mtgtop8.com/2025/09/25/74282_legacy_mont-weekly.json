By using cards like Leyline of the Void and Karn, the Great Creator, the deck aims to control the graveyard and shut down opponent's key cards. With access to efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and disruption like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach, the deck looks to dismantle the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win condition."
