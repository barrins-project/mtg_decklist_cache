By using cards like Lotus Bloom and Goblin Charbelcher, along with support from cards like Whir of Invention and Waterlogged Teachings, the deck aims to create a explosive and unexpected win condition that can catch the opponent off guard. Additionally, the inclusion of spell disruption and removal spells like Disrupting Shoal and Suppression Ray helps to control the board and protect the combo pieces."
