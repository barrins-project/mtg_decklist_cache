By utilizing cards like Voldaren Epicure and Kessig Flamebreather, as well as direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast, the deck aims to chip away at the opponent's life total while also gaining incremental advantage. The inclusion of cards like Highway Robbery and Grab the Prize provides additional reach and card advantage to ensure the deck can maintain its aggressive strategy throughout the game."
