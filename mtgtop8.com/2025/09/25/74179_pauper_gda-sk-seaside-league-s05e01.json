It also utilizes lifegain cards like Alms of the Vein and Vampire's Kiss to maintain its aggression. The mana base is a mix of Mountains and Swamps, supplemented by dual lands like Jagged Barrens and Razortrap Gorge. The aim is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of direct damage, creature attacks, and lifegain, all while controlling the board with removal spells like Chain Lightning and Lightning Bolt."
