The deck uses a variety of instant-speed answers, along with planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, to control the game and protect its own threats. With the addition of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion, the deck aims to maximize value and generate incremental advantage over the course of the game. The key strategy is to outlast the opponent and eventually win through incremental advantage and efficient removal."
