The focus is on a fast and aggressive playstyle, utilizing low-cost creatures like Deftblade Elite and Sacred Cat along with auras like Ethereal Armor and Cartouche of Solidarity to boost their power and toughness. The goal is to apply pressure early and maintain tempo throughout the game while forcing the opponent to react defensively."
