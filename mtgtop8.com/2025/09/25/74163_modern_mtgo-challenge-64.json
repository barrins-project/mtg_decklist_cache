The deck also includes disruptive elements like Dismember and Kozilek's Command to control the opponent's board and hand, while utilizing cards like Expedition Map and Relic of Progenitus for additional utility and card advantage."

The key is to efficiently tutor for the right pieces and set up strong board positions to overwhelm the opponent."

Urza's Saga provides additional artifact support, while Metallic Rebuke offers disruption for opponent's plays. Mishra's Bauble and Thoughtcast help with card draw to keep the aggression going. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of cheap, efficient creatures backed up by artifact synergy and card advantage."
