By utilizing cards like Sazh's Chocobo, Llanowar Elves, and Tifa Lockhart, the deck can establish an early board presence and maintain pressure with cards like Mossborn Hydra and Bristly Bill, Spine Sower. By including cards like Defend the Rider and Worldsoul's Rage, the deck can protect its creatures and capitalize on their power. The deck also includes some land-fetching cards to ensure consistent mana production for its aggressive strategy."
