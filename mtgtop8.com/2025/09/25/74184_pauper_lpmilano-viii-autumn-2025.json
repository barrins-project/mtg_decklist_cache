By using cheap creatures like Faerie Miscreant and Spellstutter Sprite, along with bounce spells like Resculpt and Sidisi's Faithful, the deck aims to maintain board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a low curve and plenty of counterspells, this deck can quickly establish control and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to recover."
