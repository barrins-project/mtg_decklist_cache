The deck aims to control the game until it can execute its winning combo."

By utilizing cards like Galvanic Blast and Krark-Clan Shaman for direct damage, as well as Gixian Infiltrator for evasion, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with threats. Additionally, the inclusion of Cleansing Wildfire and Drossforge Bridge allows for disruption and deck thinning to ensure consistency in drawing key cards. Overall, the deck focuses on maximizing efficiency and synergy between its components to push for a fast victory."
