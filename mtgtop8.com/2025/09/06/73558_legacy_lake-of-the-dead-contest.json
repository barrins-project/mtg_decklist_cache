It includes various ways to control the opponent's actions, such as countering spells with Force of Will and disrupting their hand with Thoughtseize and Duress. The inclusion of cards like Lotus Petal and Dark Ritual allows for explosive and fast mana generation to execute the combo efficiently, while also having access to tools like Brainstorm and Ponder for card selection and manipulation."
