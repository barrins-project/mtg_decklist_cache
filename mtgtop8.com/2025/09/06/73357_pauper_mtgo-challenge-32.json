With a focus on efficient low-cost cards like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, combined with creatures like Goblin Bushwhacker and Voldaren Epicure, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Additionally, cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Clockwork Percussionist help maintain momentum and keep up the pressure. By keeping the pressure on and dealing damage quickly, the deck looks to secure a win before the opponent can stabilize."
