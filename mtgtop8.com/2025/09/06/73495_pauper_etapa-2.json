The strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle, utilizing sacrifice effects to pump up creatures like Mortician Beetle and Bloodthrone Vampire. The deck also includes removal and card draw spells to maintain momentum. With a heavy emphasis on sacrificing creatures for benefit, the Mono Black Aggro deck aims to secure victory through constant pressure and resource advantage."
