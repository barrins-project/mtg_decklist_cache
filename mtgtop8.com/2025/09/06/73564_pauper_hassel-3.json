The deck also includes evasion effects like Dragon Wings and Artful Dodge to push through damage. By combining beatdown creatures with tempo plays and card advantage, this deck seeks to win the game before the opponent can stabilize and mount a defense."

This triggers effects such as Dread Return to bring back powerful creatures like Lotleth Giant and win the game in a single turn. The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with cards like Gatecreeper Vine and Overgrown Battlement, while also utilizing cards like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way to refill your hand with creatures. The strategy revolves around quickly assembling the combo pieces to overwhelm your opponent."
