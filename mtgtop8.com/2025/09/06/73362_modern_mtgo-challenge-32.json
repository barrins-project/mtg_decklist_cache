Fatal Push and Solitude provide removal options while Emperor of Bones and Overlord of the Balemurk deliver consistent damage. Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd can generate additional value by returning creatures from the graveyard. The deck aims to control the board and chip away at the opponent's life total to secure victory."

Disrupting Shoal and Force of Negation help protect the combo pieces, with counterspells like Spell Snare and Whir of Invention to control the game. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a game-winning combo before they can respond effectively."
