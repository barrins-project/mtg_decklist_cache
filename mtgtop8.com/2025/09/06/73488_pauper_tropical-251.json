The deck aims to generate a lot of mana quickly using the Urza Tron lands, while also using cards like Myr Retriever and Pactdoll Terror to control the board. Additionally, cards like Candy Trail and Ichor Wellspring help draw cards and keep the engine going. The deck also includes some sacrifice outlets like Ashnod's Altar and Fanatical Offering to generate more value."
