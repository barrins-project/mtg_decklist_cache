The deck focuses on playing low-cost creatures and spells to apply pressure early in the game, alongside some stronger mid-game threats. By maintaining a fast pace and maintaining board control through removal spells, this deck aims to close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of a mix of burn spells and creatures with haste helps ensure consistent damage output throughout the game."

The inclusion of disruptive cards like Quantum Riddler and Abrade helps to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Thundering Falls and Conduit Pylons provide additional mana ramp while Riverpyre Verge allows for fixing mana. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently."
