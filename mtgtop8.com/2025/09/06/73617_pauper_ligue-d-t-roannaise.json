By combining cards that generate value when sacrificed or destroyed, such as Ichor Wellspring and Refurbished Familiar, with powerful spells like Galvanic Blast and Krark-Clan Shaman, you can quickly build a threatening board presence. The mana base is optimized for efficient casting of spells and ensuring a smooth curve, with a mix of artifact lands and basic lands. This deck aims to outpace and outvalue your opponent in order to secure a swift victory."
