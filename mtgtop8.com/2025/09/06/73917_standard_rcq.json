Cards like Authority of the Consuls and Space-Time Anomaly help slow down opponent's strategies, while Day of Judgment and Into the Flood Maw provide board wipes. The deck also looks to generate card advantage with Consult the Star Charts and Meticulous Archive. The win condition is to ultimately overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Ultima and Marang River Regent, while maintaining control of the game."
