The deck aims to disrupt opponent's strategies with counterspells like Force of Negation and Pact of Negation while controlling the board with cards like Sink into Stupor and Suppression Ray. Whir of Invention helps tutor for key pieces while Jwari Disruption provides additional disruption. The deck is fast-paced and relies on intricate sequencing and calculated risks to surprise opponents and win the game."
