            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game through card advantage, counterspells, and removal, with a strong emphasis on tempo. The main win condition comes from incremental advantage generated by powerful planeswalkers like Teferi and Narset, while denying the opponent's resources and disrupting their game plan. With a mix of permission spells, board wipes, and card draw, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind them down over time. The inclusion of Kaheera as a companion provides additional synergy and flexibility in certain matchups."
