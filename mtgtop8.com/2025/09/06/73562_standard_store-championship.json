By combining efficient creature cards like Sentinel of the Nameless City and Gene Pollinator with removal spells like Abrade and Torch the Tower, the deck aims to keep the pressure on opponents while maintaining board presence. The deck also includes cards like Lively Dirge and Screaming Nemesis to disrupt opponent's strategies and push through damage. Additionally, the land base is optimized to ensure consistent mana production for the deck's aggressive strategy."
