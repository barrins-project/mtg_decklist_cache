The deck aims to establish card advantage with cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student, while controlling the board with creatures like Murktide Regent. The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor to generate even more advantage. Additionally, the deck runs a mix of dual lands and fetch lands to ensure consistent mana access throughout the game."
