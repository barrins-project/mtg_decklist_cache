By utilizing a mix of efficient creatures and removal spells, the deck aims to apply early pressure on the opponent while maintaining board control. With a focus on maintaining tempo and aggression, this deck aims to close out games quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Additionally, the deck includes cards that provide card advantage and resilience to help maintain momentum throughout the game."
