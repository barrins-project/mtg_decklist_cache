The deck focuses on cheap, aggressive creatures like Lagonna-Band Trailblazer and Vault Skirge, supported by pump spells like Blacksmith's Skill and auras like Ethereal Armor and Sentinel's Eyes. This allows the deck to apply consistent pressure on the opponent and quickly close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
