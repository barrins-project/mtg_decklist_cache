Nihil Spellbomb and Black Mage's Rod provide disruption against opponents, while Thoughtcast helps to draw more cards. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggro creatures and burn spells, taking advantage of the affinity mechanic to cast spells for less mana. The mana base consists of artifact lands and other artifact-focused lands to support the Affinity strategy."
