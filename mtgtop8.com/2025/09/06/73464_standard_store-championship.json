By utilizing a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw effects, the deck aims to stay in control of the game until it can establish a dominant position with powerful late-game threats like Overlord of the Mistmoors and Marang River Regent. The deck also includes utility lands like Fountainport and Demolition Field to further enhance its control and resource management capabilities."
