The deck seeks to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Lightning Helix and Day of Judgment, while generating card advantage with Stock Up and Consult the Star Charts. Meanwhile, powerful threats like Marang River Regent and Shiko, Paragon of the Way provide a win condition. The deck aims to control the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful spells and creatures."
