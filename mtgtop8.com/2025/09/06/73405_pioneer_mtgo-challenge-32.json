The deck also aims to control the board with cards like Unholy Annex and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse, while also using Graveyard Trespasser and Invoke Despair to disrupt your opponent's graveyard strategies. The deck's win condition mainly comes from slowly grinding out value and card advantage until the opponent is overwhelmed."
