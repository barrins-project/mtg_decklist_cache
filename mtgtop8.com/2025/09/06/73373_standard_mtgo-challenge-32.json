By efficiently casting low-cost creatures like Vivi Ornitier and Elusive Otter, combined with burn spells like Burst Lightning and Torch the Tower, you aim to deal damage quickly and close out the game before your opponent can stabilize. Use cards like Sleight of Hand and Opt to dig for more threats or burn spells while disrupting your opponent's game plan with cards like Spell Pierce. This deck looks to win through early aggression and efficient card selection."

By using a combination of fast creatures like Hired Claw and Nova Hellkite, along with direct damage spells like Lightning Strike and Burst Lightning, the goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. Additionally, cards like Soulstone Sanctuary and Riverpyre Verge provide mana acceleration and fixing to ensure a consistent stream of threats and removal. Ojer Axonil, Deepest Might and Witchstalker Frenzy offer additional power and resilience to close out games swiftly."
