Cards like Preacher of the Schism and Tragic Trajectory can help remove threats, while cards like Phantom Interference and Sunset Saboteur can disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a mix of strong creatures and versatile spells, this deck looks to quickly close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
