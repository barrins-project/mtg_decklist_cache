By buffing and supporting each other, the Slivers can quickly build up a formidable board presence and deal a large amount of damage to the opponent. The deck also includes some spells for additional support and card draw to maintain momentum. The goal is to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy."
