By utilizing efficient counterspells like Counterspell and Dispel, the deck aims to control the board while maintaining pressure. The deck also includes card draw spells like Of One Mind to ensure a steady stream of threats. With a focus on tempo and disruption, Mono Blue Aggro aims to outpace the opponent and win through consistent damage output."
