            "notes": "The main concept of this Pauper 1 vs 1 deck is to utilize the combo potential of Balustrade Spy with cards like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement to quickly mill through the deck and set up a win condition with cards like Lotleth Giant. The deck also utilizes cards like Generous Ent and Wall of Roots for mana acceleration, along with cards like Winding Way and Lead the Stampede for card advantage. The inclusion of cards like Dread Return allows for potential graveyard recursion to maintain the combo. The overall strategy focuses on quickly assembling the combo pieces to overwhelm the opponent."

By consistently applying pressure and controlling the board, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory through efficient use of resources and strategic timing. Additionally, the inclusion of card draw spells like Of One Mind helps to ensure a steady stream of threats and answers throughout the game."
