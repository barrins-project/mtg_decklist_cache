By using cards like Thoughtseize, Daze, and Force of Will, the deck aims to control the game and prevent the opponent from executing their strategy. At the same time, aggressive creatures like Nethergoyf and Murktide Regent along with removal spells like Fatal Push allow the deck to close out the game quickly. This Dimir Tempo deck looks to tempo out opponents by combining disruption with a fast clock."

Utilizing cards like Ugin, Tezzeret, and Karn, the deck aims to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, the deck includes powerful artifacts like The One Ring and Chalice of the Void to further support its combo strategy. The key is to assemble the right combination of artifacts and control elements to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."
