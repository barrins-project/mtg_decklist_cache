By utilizing cards like Momentum Breaker, Elegy Acolyte, and Sunpearl Kirin, the player aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total while also utilizing cards like Nowhere to Run and Get Lost to disrupt their strategy. The deck also includes some powerful finishers like Overlord of the Balemurk and Elspeth, Storm Slayer. By controlling the board and applying pressure, the deck seeks to secure victory through a combination of creature damage and spell disruption."
