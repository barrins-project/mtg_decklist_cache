By using combo pieces like Ephemerate and Solitude, the deck aims to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up the instant reanimation combo. The inclusion of cards like Force of Negation and Prismatic Ending helps to protect the combo and deal with opposing threats. Overall, the deck focuses on instant reanimation and comboing off to overwhelm the opponent."
