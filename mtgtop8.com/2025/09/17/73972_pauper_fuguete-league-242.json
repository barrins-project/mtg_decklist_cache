With cards like Ethereal Armor and Armadillo Cloak boosting the creatures' stats, the deck focuses on fast-paced aggression to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own board presence."

Card draw and selection like Brainstorm, Thought Scour, and Ponder help the deck find its key cards, while maintaining a low mana curve.

It uses cards like Expedition Map and Crop Rotation to fetch the Urza lands, while also utilizing artifacts like Myr Retriever and Ashnod's Altar for additional value. The deck can control the board with cards like Candy Trail and Weather the Storm, while also having a win condition with Golem Foundry and Eviscerator's Insight. Overall, the deck aims to ramp up quickly and overwhelm the opponent with powerful spells and creatures."
