The deck aims to quickly build a board presence with efficient creatures like Llanowar Elves and Railway Brawler, while also utilizing powerful spells like Esper Origins and Devastating Onslaught to control the board and push for damage. By combining creature aggression with spell disruption, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory."
