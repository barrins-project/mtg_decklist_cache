            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly overwhelming your opponent with aggressive creatures and burn spells. The key strategy is to play efficient creatures like Burnout Bashtronaut and Nova Hellkite early on to deal damage, while using burn spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike to control the board and finish off your opponent. Riverpyre Verge and Soulstone Sanctuary help ensure you have enough mana to cast your spells, while Ojer Axonil and Tersa Lightshatter provide additional power and resilience to your creatures. Overall, the goal is to deal as much damage as possible early on to secure a quick victory."
