The key strategy revolves around using Pinnacle Starcage to protect key creatures and setting up powerful combos with Momentum Breaker and Bitter Triumph. Duress and Commune with Evil help disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Enduring Tenacity and Bloodthirsty Conqueror provide resilience and finishers. The deck aims to control the board early on and then overwhelm the opponent with a combination of powerful creatures and game-changing spells."
