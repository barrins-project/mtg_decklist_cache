The deck also includes cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Mind Stone for additional control and ramp options, making it a potent control archetype in the 1 vs 1 Modern format."

It utilizes cards like Ruby Medallion and Wrenn's Resolve to reduce the cost of spells and enable explosive turns. The deck also includes cards like Past in Flames and Artist's Talent to recur spells from the graveyard and generate additional value. The goal is to create a storm of spells that overwhelm the opponent and win the game in a single turn."
