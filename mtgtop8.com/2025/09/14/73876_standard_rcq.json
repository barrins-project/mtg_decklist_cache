The deck aims to control the board with cards like Day of Judgment and Three Steps Ahead while slowly building up to powerful finishers like Elspeth, Storm Slayer and Ultima. The combination of counterspells, removal, and card advantage engines allows the player to grind out their opponent and win through attrition."
