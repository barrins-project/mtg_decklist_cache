The deck aims to quickly establish a board presence with efficient creatures like Frenzied Baloth and Keen-Eyed Curator, supported by ramp from Llanowar Elves. Cards like Giant Growth and Tifa's Limit Break provide additional pump effects to push through damage, while Royal Treatment can provide removal when needed. Innkeeper's Talent helps to maintain card advantage, while cards like Surrak, Elusive Hunter and Soulstone Sanctuary provide resilience and additional utility."
