Tezzeret, Cruel Captain and Karn, the Great Creator provide additional utility and win conditions. The goal is to assemble the necessary pieces to create a powerful board state and overwhelm your opponent with a combination of artifacts and powerful abilities. The synergy between cards like Urza's Tower and The One Ring also provides ramp and card advantage to support the combo engine."
