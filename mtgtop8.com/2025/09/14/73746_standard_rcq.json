It includes a mix of efficient burn spells and high-impact creatures to apply constant pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to control the board early with removal spells and then finish off the opponent with a combination of direct damage and powerful creatures. By maintaining a fast pace and not giving the opponent time to stabilize, the deck is able to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to mount a defense."
