By playing multiple low-cost creatures and buffs like Battle Menu and Requisition Raid, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and apply pressure to the opponent. Cards like Enduring Innocence and Haliya, Guided by Light provide additional support, while powerful finishers like Elspeth, Storm Slayer and Basri, Tomorrow's Champion can secure victory. This deck focuses on speed, efficiency, and relentless aggression to achieve victory in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
