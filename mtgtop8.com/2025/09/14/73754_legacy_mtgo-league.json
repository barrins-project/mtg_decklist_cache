By using cards like Eldrazi Temple and Lotus Petal, the deck can quickly drop high-cost Eldrazi creatures onto the battlefield, such as Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer. Chalice of the Void helps control the opponent's spells, while Wasteland and Wastes disrupt their mana base. The deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain a strong board presence to swiftly defeat the opponent."
