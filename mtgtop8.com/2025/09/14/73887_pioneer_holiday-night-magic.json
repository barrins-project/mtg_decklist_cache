The deck also utilizes powerful cards like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Hall of Storm Giants to further pressure opponents and secure victories."

This deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent and win the game through a relentless assault of creatures. The mana base is optimized to support the aggressive game plan with a mix of white and red dual lands and Cavern of Souls to ensure the Human creatures can't be countered."
