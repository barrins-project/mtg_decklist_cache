The deck focuses on disruption with creatures like Thought-Knot Seer and Glaring Fleshraker, while also using Karn, the Great Creator to shut down opponents with artifacts. Ugin, Eye of the Storms provides additional control, and Eldrazi Temple enables big plays. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its high-value threats and consistent mana production."

By utilizing cheap spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Dart, along with powerful creatures like Dragon's Rage Channeler and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to quickly deal damage and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The deck also includes card draw and selection spells like Expressive Iteration and Preordain to help maintain card advantage and find the right cards for each situation."
