By utilizing cards like Llanowar Elves and Pawpatch Recruit, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure throughout the game. Cards like Sheltered by Ghosts and Starting Town provide protection for key creatures, while cards like Skyknight Squire and Elspeth, Storm Slayer offer additional aggression and disruption. The deck aims to close out games quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
