The deck also utilizes Amulet of Vigor to untap lands that enter the battlefield tapped, allowing for explosive plays and utilizing lands like Lotus Field to generate large amounts of mana. This combo-oriented strategy aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful land synergies and finish them off with massive Valakut triggers."
