The deck aims to curve out efficiently and apply pressure early on, while also having some late-game reach with cards like Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury. Utilizing cards like Goblin Bombardment and Arena of Glory, the deck can control the board and maintain its aggression to secure the win in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."
