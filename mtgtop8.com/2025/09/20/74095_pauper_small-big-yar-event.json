By utilizing creatures like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement to generate mana, the deck can cast impactful spells like Freed from the Real or Bloodrite Invoker to secure victory. Additionally, cards like Drift of Phantasms and Lead the Stampede help to dig through the deck and find the necessary pieces for the combo."
