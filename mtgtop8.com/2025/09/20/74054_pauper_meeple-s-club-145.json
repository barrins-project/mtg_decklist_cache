By utilizing cards like Quirion Ranger and Timberwatch Elf, the deck can pump up its creatures to deal massive amounts of damage in a short amount of time. Wellwisher helps to keep the player alive against aggressive opponents, while Lead the Stampede and Winding Way ensure a steady stream of creatures to maintain pressure throughout the game."
