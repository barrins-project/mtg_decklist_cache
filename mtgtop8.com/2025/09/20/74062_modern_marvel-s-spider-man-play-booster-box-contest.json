It also includes control elements such as Chalice of the Void and Relic of Progenitus to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, Eye of the Storms provide additional control and utility. The deck aims to overpower the opponent with efficient creatures and powerful spells, ultimately dominating the game through a combination of ramp, control, and threats."
