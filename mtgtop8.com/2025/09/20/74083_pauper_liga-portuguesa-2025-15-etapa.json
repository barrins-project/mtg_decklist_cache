This synergy between sacrificing and recursion allows for a constant stream of threats and value generation, overwhelming your opponent with a combination of aggression and resource advantage. The inclusion of various removal spells and utility lands further supports this aggressive playstyle, making it a versatile and powerful deck in Pauper 1 vs 1 matchups."
