The deck focuses on controlling the board with removal spells like Dismember and Kozilek's Command, while also disrupting the opponent's hand with Thought-Knot Seer. Glaring Fleshraker and Sire of Seven Deaths provide additional threats, while Expedition Map ensures consistent land drops. Warping Wail adds versatility to deal with a variety of situations."

It also includes various control elements like Thought-Knot Seer and Kozilek's Command to disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain board presence. Tezzeret, Cruel Captain provides card advantage and utility, while cards like Ugin's Labyrinth and Chalice of the Void help to control the board and protect against opposing strategies. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big threats while controlling the game state."
