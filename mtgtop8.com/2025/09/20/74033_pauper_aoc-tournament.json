The deck also focuses on ramping up mana with creatures like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement, while filtering through your deck with cards like Winding Way and Lead the Stampede to find your combo pieces. Overall, the goal is to set up the combo quickly and overwhelm your opponent with a powerful finish."
