            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly assemble the Allosaurus Rider combo by using Eldritch Evolution and Neoform to tutor for key pieces like Griselbrand and Xenagos, God of Revels. The deck also utilizes creatures like Hooting Mandrills, Atraxa, Grand Unifier, and Ghalta, Stampede Tyrant to apply pressure on the opponent while setting up the combo. Pact of Negation and Veil of Summer provide protection for key spells, ensuring the combo can be successfully executed. With the right pieces in place, this deck can quickly take over the game and secure a victory."

The deck also aims to control the board with Wrath of the Skies and Solitude, while using Teferi, Time Raveler to slow down the opponent's plays. The deck runs a mix of utility lands to help fix mana and provide additional value. Overall, the deck focuses on outlasting the opponent and ultimately overwhelming them with its control elements."
