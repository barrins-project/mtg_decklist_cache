By combining creatures like Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd and Solitude with disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push, the deck aims to control the board and limit the opponent's options. Additionally, cards like Relic of Progenitus and Ephemerate provide additional value and graveyard hate. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Emperor of Bones and Overlord of the Balemurk help to close out the game quickly once the opponent's defenses have been broken down."
