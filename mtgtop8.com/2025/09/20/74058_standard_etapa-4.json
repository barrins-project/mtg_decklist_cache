It aims to control the board with creature removal and protection spells while boosting its own creatures with auras to deal heavy damage. The deck also utilizes powerful enchantments and lands to provide additional support and utility. By combining efficient creatures, potent auras, and strategic spell use, the deck aims to quickly close out games through a strong, fast-paced offense."
