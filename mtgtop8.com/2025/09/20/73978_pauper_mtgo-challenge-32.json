As the game progresses, cards like Goblin Bushwhacker and Rally at the Hornburg provide ways to pump up your creatures and end the game swiftly.

The key strategy is to use cards like Priest of Titania and Quirion Ranger to generate lots of mana, allowing for explosive plays with Timberwatch Elf and Nyxborn Hydra. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help refill the hand with more Elf creatures, while Wellwisher provides sustainability against aggressive opponents. Overall, the deck aims to win by building a wide board presence and leveraging the synergy between its Elf creatures to outpace and outmatch the opponent."
