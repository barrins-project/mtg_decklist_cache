The inclusion of Enduring Curiosity allows for card draw, while cards like Mutavault and Seachrome Coast provide additional utility.

Lumra, Bellow of the Woods and The Wandering Minstrel provide additional value and consistency to the deck, while cards like Ipnu Rivulet and Nissa, Resurgent Animist offer alternative win conditions if the combo pieces are not available. The deck is built around efficiently finding and using Lotus Field to enable explosive plays."

By consistently applying pressure and efficiently using your resources, you aim to close out the game before your opponent has a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Burst Lightning, Kumano Faces Kakkazan, and Monstrous Rage help you to maintain a fast pace and keep the pressure on your opponent throughout the game."
