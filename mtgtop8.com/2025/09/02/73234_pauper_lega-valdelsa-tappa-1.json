By utilizing cheap spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Dart, combined with creatures like Kessig Flamebreather and Voldaren Epicure, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Supporting cards like Fireblast and Fiery Temper provide additional burn capabilities, while Faithless Looting helps dig for key cards. Highway Robbery and Grab the Prize offer extra value by generating additional resources. Overall, the deck is designed to apply pressure early and close out matches before the opponent can stabilize."
