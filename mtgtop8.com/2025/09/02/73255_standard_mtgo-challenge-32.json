The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast creatures like Emberheart Challenger and Nova Hellkite, while supporting them with burn spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike. The deck aims to keep up the pressure and finish the game before the opponent can stabilize. Soulstone Sanctuary and Witchstalker Frenzy provide additional utility and protection for the creatures. The key strategy is to maintain a high tempo and close out the game efficiently."
