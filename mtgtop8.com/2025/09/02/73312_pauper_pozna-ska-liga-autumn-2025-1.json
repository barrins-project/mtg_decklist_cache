By utilizing cards that can fill the graveyard quickly and reduce the costs of powerful creatures like Cryptic Serpent, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain tempo advantage. The inclusion of counterspells and card draw spells helps to protect the game plan and ensure consistency in drawing threats. Overall, the deck focuses on establishing an aggressive board presence while maintaining control over the game."
