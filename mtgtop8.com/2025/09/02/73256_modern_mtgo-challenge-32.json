Utilizing cards like Ajani, Seasoned Pyromancer, and Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer, you can quickly apply pressure to your opponent while also keeping your board presence strong. Cards like Goblin Bombardment and Galvanic Discharge provide additional reach and removal options, while Static Prison and Arena of Glory disrupt your opponent's game plan. By constantly applying pressure and keeping your opponent on the back foot, you aim to close out the game quickly and decisively."

Malevolent Rumble and Writhing Chrysalis provide additional removal options while Herigast, Erupting Nullkite can generate tokens for added pressure.

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to apply pressure on the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and disruption spells. By using cards like Path to Exile to remove threats, Ephemerate to reuse powerful abilities, and Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd to generate tokens, the deck aims to control the board while dealing damage quickly. Quantum Riddler and Guide of Souls provide additional support and card advantage, while Starfield Shepherd and White Orchid Phantom offer a strong late-game presence. The mana base is designed to support the deck's curve and provide consistent access to all colors needed for its spells."
