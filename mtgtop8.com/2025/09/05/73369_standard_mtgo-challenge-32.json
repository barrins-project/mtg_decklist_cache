The deck also utilizes powerful cards like Elspeth, Storm Slayer and Cosmogrand Zenith to generate additional advantages and finish off the opponent."

With a low mana curve and a high number of creatures, the deck aims to control the board early on and continuously apply pressure to the opponent. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Nova Hellkite and Burnout Bashtronaut ensures that the deck can close out games quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Overall, this deck aims to win the game as fast as possible through efficient creature beats and burn damage."
