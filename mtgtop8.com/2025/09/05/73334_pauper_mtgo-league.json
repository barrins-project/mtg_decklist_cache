Creatures like Fangren Marauder and Annoyed Altisaur provide defense and life gain, while Candy Trail and Generous Ent help with card draw and resource management. Crop Rotation and Expedition Map are used to find specific lands, while Pinnacle Kill-Ship is a finisher card. Overall, the deck focuses on ramping up mana and controlling the opponent's board."

By including artifacts that can be cast for reduced mana costs, such as Thoughtcast and Myr Enforcer, the deck gains momentum and overwhelms opponents quickly. The inclusion of removal spells like Cast Down and Tithing Blade helps to control the opponent's board while cards like Glint Hawk and Kor Skyfisher provide additional value by returning artifacts to hand. Overall, this deck aims to be efficient, proactive, and disruptive in order to secure a swift victory."

Once the combo pieces are assembled, the player can use cards like Lembas and Eviscerator's Insight to finish off their opponent quickly. The deck also includes some disruption in the form of Nihil Spellbomb and Crypt Rats to hinder the opponent's strategy."
