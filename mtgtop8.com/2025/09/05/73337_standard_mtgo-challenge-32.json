By deploying threats like Spyglass Siren and Gloomlake Verge early on, the deck aims to quickly establish a strong battlefield presence. Cards like Shoot the Sheriff and Tragic Trajectory provide removal options to deal with opposing threats, while cards like Kaito, Bane of Nightmares and Bitter Triumph help to close out the game by dealing direct damage to the opponent. Overall, the strategy of this deck is to maintain tempo and overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggression and disruption."
