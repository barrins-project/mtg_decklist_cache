By efficiently using cards like Lightning Bolt, Fiery Temper, and Fireblast, along with creatures like Voldaren Epicure and Kessig Flamebreather, the goal is to reduce the opponent's life total to zero as fast as possible. Faithless Looting helps with card selection and getting rid of unwanted cards, while Highway Robbery and Grab the Prize provide additional reach and card advantage. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize or gain control of the game."
