By combining evasive creatures like Spyglass Siren with removal spells like Tragic Trajectory, this deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent in the early to mid-game. Cards like Azure Beastbinder and Kaito, Bane of Nightmares provide additional threats that can close out the game quickly. The inclusion of Soulstone Sanctuary and Enduring Curiosity helps to maintain card advantage and generate value throughout the match."
