The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats while disrupting their game plan."

The deck also includes counter spells like Counterspell and Force of Negation to protect the combo pieces. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a game-winning combo without needing traditional land resources."

Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a strong board presence and efficient removal spells to secure victory in Modern 1 vs 1 matches."
