By combining graveyard manipulation with powerful creatures like Archon of Cruelty and Emperor of Bones, you can overwhelm your opponent with a strong board presence. Cards like Spell Pierce and Fatal Push provide disruption and removal options to help protect your combo. The deck aims to win through explosive plays and out-valuing your opponent."
