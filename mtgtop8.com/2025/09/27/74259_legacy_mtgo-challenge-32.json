The deck also includes disruption spells like Force of Will and Daze to protect your combo pieces and control the opponent's game plan. Murktide Regent and Archon of Cruelty provide strong threats that can close out the game quickly once they hit the battlefield. Overall, the deck aims to outpace and overwhelm the opponent with its graveyard recursion and disruptive spells."
