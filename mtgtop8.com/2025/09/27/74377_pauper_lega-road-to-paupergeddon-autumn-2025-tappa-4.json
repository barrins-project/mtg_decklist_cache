The goal is to eventually win through a massive storm count or a mill win condition with Lórien Revealed. The deck is designed to be fast, efficient, and capable of winning in a single explosive turn."

The deck also includes removal spells like Cast Down and Fanatical Offering to deal with opposing threats."
