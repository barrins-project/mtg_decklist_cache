By utilizing cards like Skirk Prospector and Putrid Goblin, you can create explosive turns where you can cast multiple spells to overwhelm your opponent. The deck aims to keep a steady flow of resources by sacrificing Ichor Wellspring and using Dark-Dweller Oracle to dig deeper into your library. With the right synergies in place, this deck can create powerful combos and outpace your opponent."
