The deck utilizes cards like Thundertrap Trainer and The One Ring to accelerate the ramping process. It also includes countermagic in the form of Force of Will and Force of Negation to protect the combo pieces. Chalice of the Void is used to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Karn, the Great Creator provides additional utility. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with big threats and powerful spells."
