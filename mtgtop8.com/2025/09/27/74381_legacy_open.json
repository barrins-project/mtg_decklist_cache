By combining powerful cards like Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Urza's Saga with strong artifact creatures like Kappa Cannoneer and Sai, Master Thopterist, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and maintain control of the game. Cards like Chalice of the Void and Force of Will provide additional disruption, while Urza's Bauble and Lotus Petal help to ramp up mana for faster plays."

Mishra's Bauble and Brainstorm provide card advantage and help set up powerful plays. Lightning Bolt offers additional removal and reach. The mana base is streamlined to support casting spells efficiently while also utilizing Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, this deck aims to apply pressure while disrupting the opponent's strategy to secure a victory."
