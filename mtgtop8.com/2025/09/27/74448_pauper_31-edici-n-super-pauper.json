            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle. By utilizing low-cost creatures like Burning-Tree Emissary and Goblin Bushwhacker, along with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total. The inclusion of cards like Rally at the Hornburg and Reckless Abandon provide additional reach to finish off the opponent. Overall, the deck focuses on applying pressure early and maintaining a relentless assault to secure victory."
