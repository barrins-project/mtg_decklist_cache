By using efficient creatures like Marauding Mako and Steamcore Scholar, along with removal spells like Abrade and Obliterating Bolt, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total. The deck also utilizes card draw and spell recursion to maintain momentum and keep up the pressure. Overall, the strategy focuses on a relentless assault to secure a quick victory."
