The deck aims to maintain tempo by utilizing cards like Stock Up and Cosmogrand Zenith, and closing out the game quickly with cards like Momentum Breaker and Stormchaser's Talent. The mana base is geared towards consistency and flexibility, with access to both white and blue cards in addition to black for a wide range of spells and strategies."
