The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of creature aggression and lifegain synergies, ultimately aiming to close out games quickly before opponents can stabilize. The inclusion of Collected Company and Kayla's Reconstruction provide additional tools for finding key creatures and maintaining a strong board presence. The deck's mana base supports its aggressive strategy while also providing consistency and flexibility."
