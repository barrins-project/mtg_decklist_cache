By using cards like Lotus Bloom, Thundertrap Trainer, and Goblin Charbelcher, the player can create explosive plays and overwhelm the opponent quickly. Additional control elements like Suppression Ray and Sink into Stupor help stall the game while the player sets up their combo. The use of Tameshi, Reality Architect and Whir of Invention allows the player to tutor for important pieces of the combo efficiently. This deck aims to win the game through a creative and unconventional approach to mana generation and card advantage."

By combining reanimation effects with powerful finishers like Archon of Cruelty and Emperor of Bones, the deck can overwhelm opponents with its strong creatures and disruptive plays. The deck also has some control elements with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own combos."
