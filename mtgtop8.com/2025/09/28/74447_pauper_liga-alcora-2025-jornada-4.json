By utilizing cards like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement in combination with mana dorks like Llanowar Elves, the deck aims to ramp up quickly and eventually go infinite with Freed from the Real and Galvanic Alchemist combo. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help with card advantage and finding combo pieces, while defensive walls like Shield-Wall Sentinel protect the player until the combo is assembled. Reaping the Graves provides a recursive element to keep the engine going."
