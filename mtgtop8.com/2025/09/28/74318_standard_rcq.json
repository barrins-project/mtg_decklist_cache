The deck includes a mix of removal spells, counter spells, and efficient creatures to maintain a tempo advantage and prevent the opponent from stabilizing. The inclusion of cards like Enduring Curiosity and Soulstone Sanctuary provide card advantage and additional resilience to outlast the opponent in longer games."
