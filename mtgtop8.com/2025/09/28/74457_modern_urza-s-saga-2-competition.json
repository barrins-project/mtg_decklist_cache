The deck looks to disrupt the opponent's strategy while also generating card advantage through the cascading effects of cards like Bloodbraid Elf and Shardless Agent. The deck's main win condition comes from deploying powerful threats like Omnath, Locus of Creation and Obsidian Charmaw to overwhelm the opponent. The mana base is designed to ensure consistency in casting spells of different colors while also providing options for fetching specific lands when needed."
