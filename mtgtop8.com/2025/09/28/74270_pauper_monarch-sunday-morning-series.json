With a mix of low-cost creatures to apply pressure and disrupt the opponent, as well as card advantage engines like Ninja of the Deep Hours and Maestros Theater, the deck aims to out-value the opponent while efficiently dealing with threats. The addition of cheap removal spells and counterspells allows the deck to answer threats effectively and protect its own win conditions."
