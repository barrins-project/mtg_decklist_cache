By utilizing a combination of creatures with evasion abilities and counterspells, it aims to disrupt opponents' strategies while maintaining board advantage. With a lower mana curve and a focus on card draw and tempo plays, the deck aims to consistently put pressure on opponents early in the game and maintain that pressure to secure a victory."
