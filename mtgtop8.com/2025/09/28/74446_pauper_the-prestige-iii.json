It utilizes cards like Mnemonic Wall and Ghostly Flicker to recycle key spells, while also generating tokens with Murmuring Mystic. The deck includes various utility spells like Crop Rotation and Mystical Teachings for flexibility. It also features some lifegain and protection spells like Moment's Peace and Pulse of Murasa. The goal is to outvalue the opponent by consistently drawing cards, maintaining board presence, and eventually overwhelming them with powerful spells."
