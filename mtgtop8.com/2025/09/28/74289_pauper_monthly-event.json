By combining low-cost creatures like Kitchen Imp and Sneaky Snacker with burn spells like Chain Lightning and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan. The inclusion of lifegain cards like Alms of the Vein and Vampire's Kiss helps to sustain the aggressive strategy, creating a fast-paced and relentless playstyle. Overall, this Rakdos Aggro deck aims to take control of the game early and maintain its aggressive momentum until victory."
