It aims to control the game by continuously recurring key cards like Mulldrifter and Mnemonic Wall, while disrupting the opponent's strategies with counterspells and removal. With access to a variety of options like card draw, recursion, and fog effects, the deck can outlast opponents and grind out victories through attrition. The key strategy is to assemble Urzatron lands early on to ramp up mana production and establish a dominant board presence through efficient control spells and creatures."
