It uses cards like Karn, the Great Creator and The One Ring to search for key pieces and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Crop Rotation and Boseiju, Who Endures help to protect the combo while Elvish Spirit Guide provides additional acceleration. The deck also includes ways to deal with graveyard strategies with Bojuka Bog and Soul-Guide Lantern. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, high-powered threats and lock down the game with powerful spells."
