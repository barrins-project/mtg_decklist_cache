With a mix of control elements like Sink into Stupor and Force of Negation, along with card filtering cards like Step Through and Spider-Sense, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and win the game with cards like Goblin Charbelcher. The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent while efficiently assembling the combo for a quick win."
