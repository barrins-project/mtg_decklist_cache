The deck also has a small amount of flicker effects to reuse enter-the-battlefield abilities of creatures like Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd and Witch Enchanter. By efficiently managing resources and applying constant pressure, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent to achieve victory."

The key strategy revolves around generating mana and card advantage through cards like Whir of Invention and Hydroelectric Specimen, while controlling the board with cards like Sink into Stupor and Force of Negation. By denying the opponent resources and disrupting their game plan, the deck aims to eventually win the game with a well-timed Charbelcher activation or overwhelming the opponent with a massive board state."
