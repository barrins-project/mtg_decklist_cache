The deck also features cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, the Eye of the Storms to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The goal is to quickly assemble the combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with powerful artifact spells and abilities, ultimately leading to victory through a combination of card advantage, mana acceleration, and board control."
