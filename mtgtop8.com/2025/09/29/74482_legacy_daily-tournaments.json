The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's plans with counterspells and removal while also generating card advantage and tempo with cards like Brainstorm and Ponder. The deck also includes powerful threats like Teferi, Time Raveler and Murktide Regent to close out the game once control has been established. Additionally, the deck utilizes a diverse mana base to ensure it can cast its spells efficiently."

The deck also includes control elements like Brazen Borrower and Murktide Regent to handle threats, along with card draw and protection spells like Force of Will and Daze to ensure the combo goes off successfully."
