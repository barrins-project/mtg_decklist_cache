The deck also includes cards to protect and control the game, such as Counterspell and Cast Down. By utilizing spells like Brainstorm and Ponder, the deck aims to set up the perfect combination of cards to execute its reanimation strategy. With a mix of control elements and graveyard synergy, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures early in the game."
