The deck aims to maintain board control through removal spells such as Fatal Push and Go for the Throat, while also utilizing powerful finishers like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse. The deck's mana base also allows for flexibility in casting its spells efficiently and consistently. Overall, the deck looks to quickly close out the game through a combination of disruption, aggression, and powerful threats."
