This deck aims to use this mana advantage to cast powerful spells and combo off quickly, digging through the deck with cards like Peer Through Depths, Brainstorm, and Merchant Scroll to find the necessary pieces. The inclusion of cards like Gigadrowse and Reach Through Mists helps to disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining the momentum of the combo."
