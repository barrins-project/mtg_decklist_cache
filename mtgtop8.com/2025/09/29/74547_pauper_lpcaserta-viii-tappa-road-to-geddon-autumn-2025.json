The mana base includes artifact lands like Seat of the Synod and Vault of Whispers to further support the Affinity mechanic, while also including utility lands like Bojuka Bog for graveyard hate."

By using cards like Krark-Clan Shaman and Gixian Infiltrator alongside Refurbished Familiar and Ichor Wellspring, the deck aims to constantly apply pressure while maintaining card advantage. Writhing Chyrsalis and Fanatical Offering provide additional creature tokens for swarm tactics. Cleansing Wildfire helps with fixing mana and disrupting the opponent's game plan. This deck looks to quickly close out the game with a mix of direct damage, creature beats, and card advantage."
