Aether Vial helps to cheat creatures into play, while Counterspell and Sink into Stupor provide some interaction and protection. With a focus on tempo and board presence, this deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent to secure victory."

The key strategy involves tutoring for specific creatures with cards like Chord of Calling and Green Sun's Zenith, while also utilizing Yawgmoth, Thran Physician for card draw and removal. The deck is able to generate value through sacrificing creatures and creating synergies between different cards. It aims to control the board with a mix of removal, resilience, and combo potential to outmaneuver opponents and secure victory."
