The deck utilizes cards like Mox Diamond and Exploration to ramp up mana quickly, while also using cards like Crop Rotation and Life from the Loam to fetch important lands like Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage. The inclusion of cards like Wasteland and The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale also helps to disrupt the opponent's strategy, making it difficult for them to execute their game plan effectively."
