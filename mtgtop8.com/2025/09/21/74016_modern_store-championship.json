By utilizing cards like Blade of the Bloodchief and malevolent rumble, along with Emrakul, the Promised End and Glaring Fleshraker, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with massive creatures and devastating abilities. With a mix of artifact ramp and land acceleration, the deck can quickly build up a board presence and outpace the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Soul-Guide Lantern and Ugin's Labyrinth also provide disruption and control options to protect the combo."
