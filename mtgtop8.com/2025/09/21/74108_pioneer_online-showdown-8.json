Cards like Arboreal Grazer and Lumra, Bellow of the Woods help accelerate land drops, while spells like Scapeshift and Stock Up can provide additional resources. The goal is to create a massive mana advantage, allowing you to cast powerful spells or activate abilities that can quickly overwhelm your opponent and secure victory. The deck is designed to efficiently ramp up to a game-winning play."
