The deck utilizes various card draw and filtering methods to find key pieces of the combo, as well as ways to recur important spells from the graveyard. With a mix of removal, counterspells, and card advantage, this deck aims to outvalue opponents and secure victory through efficient use of resources and strategic decision-making."

Using counterspells to protect its threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan, it aims to maintain pressure and control the pace of the game. The deck also utilizes card draw and graveyard manipulation to ensure consistency and keep the pressure on. Overall, the strategy revolves around efficient use of resources and aggressive plays to quickly close out the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
