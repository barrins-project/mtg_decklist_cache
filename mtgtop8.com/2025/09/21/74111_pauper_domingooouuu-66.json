            "notes": "The main idea of the deck is to overwhelm the opponent quickly with a swarm of aggressive creatures like Goblin Bushwhacker and Goblin Tomb Raider, combined with efficient burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt. The deck also includes cards like Clockwork Percussionist and Voldaren Epicure to maintain pressure on the opponent. Additionally, cards like Burning-Tree Emissary provide mana acceleration, allowing for explosive plays like casting multiple spells in a turn. Overall, the deck aims to close out the game as quickly as possible through a combination of creature aggression and direct damage."
