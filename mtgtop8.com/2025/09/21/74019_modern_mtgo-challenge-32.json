The key concept revolves around sacrificing Allosaurus Rider to generate mana with Nourishing Shoal and then using that mana to cast huge creatures like Griselbrand or Ghalta, Stampede Tyrant. The deck also has ways to protect the combo with counterspells like Pact of Negation and Veil of Summer. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures and powerful effects while also having combo potential."

By utilizing a combination of counterspells, tutors, and disruptive spells, the deck aims to control the game until it can play cards like Goblin Charbelcher or Lotus Bloom to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent. This landless combo deck relies on precise sequencing and strategic decision-making to outmaneuver opponents and win through unconventional means."

It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of burn spells, aggressive creatures, and card advantage from effects like Mishra's Bauble and Expressive Iteration. The strategy is to apply continuous pressure on the opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. The deck's key strength lies in its ability to be proactive and push for a fast victory through efficient card selection and aggressive plays."
