Use card advantage engines like Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student and Psychic Frog to pull ahead, while deploying threats like Murktide Regent and Kaito, Bane of Nightmares to pressure the opponent. Keep the opponent's resources in check with cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Sheoldred's Edict, while protecting your own game plan with disruptive spells like Force of Negation and Spell Snare. Use efficient removal like Fatal Push to keep the board clear and maintain control until you can close out the game."
