It aims to use inexpensive spells like Chain Lightning, Lightning Bolt, and Galvanic Blast to deal damage while deploying creatures like Goblin Tomb Raider and Voldaren Epicure to maintain pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Clockwork Percussionist and Thermo-Alchemist provides additional damage output, while cards like Wrenn's Resolve help protect the creatures from removal. The deck's goal is to end the game quickly by relentlessly attacking the opponent."
