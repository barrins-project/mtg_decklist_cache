It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while slowly building up its own resources and eventually closing out the game with powerful threats like Murktide Regent or Thundertrap Trainer. By staying ahead on cards and mana efficiency, the deck can outlast and outmaneuver opponents in the long game, eventually overwhelming them with its powerful spells and creatures."
