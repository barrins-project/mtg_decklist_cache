It also includes disruption and protection spells like Thoughtseize, Force of Will, and Daze to control the game and protect the combo. The deck utilizes counterspells and card draw to help find the combo pieces and disrupt opponents, while also having mana denial with Wasteland. Overall, the deck is focused on using graveyard synergies to quickly reanimate big threats and overwhelm the opponent."
