Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Pinnacle Emissary provide additional value by recurring artifacts and searching for specific cards, while Chalice of the Void and Force of Will offer protection and disruption against opposing spells. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and control through the power of artifact synergy."
