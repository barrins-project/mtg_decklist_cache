The deck also features some late-game reach with cards like Fear of Missing Out and Winternight Stories. The goal is to maintain a fast pace throughout the game and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."

By consistently applying pressure through early creature drops and burn spells, the goal is to swiftly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of resilient threats like Nova Hellkite and Razorkin Needlehead ensures that the deck can maintain a steady stream of damage even if individual threats are removed. Combined with additional burn spells and creature pump effects, this deck aims to win the game through relentless aggression and efficient damage output."
