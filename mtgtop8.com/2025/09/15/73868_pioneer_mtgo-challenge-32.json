The key strategy is to cast multiple spells in a turn to trigger the Phoenix's ability to return from the graveyard. The inclusion of Temporal Trespass as a potential game-ending finisher adds another layer to the deck's explosiveness, while cards like Lightning Axe and Fiery Impulse help to control the board early on. Overall, the deck focuses on aggressive gameplay and efficient use of resources to overwhelm the opponent."
