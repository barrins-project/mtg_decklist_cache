            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing Amulet of Vigor to ramp up mana quickly and efficiently, allowing for the early deployment of Primeval Titan. The key strategy involves taking advantage of the powerful land synergy in the deck, such as Gruul Turf, Simic Growth Chamber, and Vesuva, to generate massive amounts of mana and consistently search for key lands with cards like Scapeshift and Summoner's Pact. By utilizing the land toolbox to its fullest potential, the deck can quickly assemble the necessary resources to overwhelm opponents with powerful combo plays like fetching multiple Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle with Primeval Titan."

It utilizes cards like Faithless Looting and Thought Scour to discard creatures like Emperor of Bones and Archon of Cruelty, which can then be brought back with cards like Unearth and Persist. This strategy aims to outpace and outvalue the opponent by reanimating threats while disrupting their game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push. The goal is to create a powerful board state and win the game with efficient combos."

The land base also supports the strategy by providing colored mana and utility effects like Field of Ruin and Shefet Dunes."
