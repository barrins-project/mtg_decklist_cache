It uses cards like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Stock Up to find key pieces quickly, while also having protection through Force of Will and Veil of Summer. The deck aims to create explosive turns and overwhelm the opponent with big creatures that can quickly end the game. It relies on the combination of cheating creatures into play and protecting them to secure victory."
