By utilizing aggressive creatures like Goblin Tomb Raider and Voldaren Epicure, along with efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, you can deal damage fast and finish off your opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Clockwork Percussionist and Experimental Synthesizer help to maintain a steady flow of damage while Thermo-Alchemist provides additional burn damage over time. The goal is to win the game as quickly as possible through constant pressure and direct damage."

By maintaining a fast-paced aggressive strategy, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize or set up their own game plan. Cards like Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, and Fireblast provide direct damage to the opponent, while creatures like Sneaky Snacker and Kessig Flamebreather offer consistent threats on the board. This deck is designed to apply pressure from the very beginning and close out games swiftly."
