It also includes some card draw and graveyard hate with Ichor Wellspring and Nihil Spellbomb. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent quickly with a combination of creatures and removal spells, while also gaining card advantage and disrupting their strategy. Additionally, the deck includes some land destruction with Cleansing Wildfire to further disrupt the opponent's resources and slow them down."
