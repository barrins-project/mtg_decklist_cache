The deck focuses on playing numerous creatures like Kor Skyfisher and Squadron Hawk to create a strong board presence early on. The inclusion of cards like Prismatic Strands and Thraben Charm help protect the creatures and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck aims to maintain a steady stream of pressure and aggression to defeat the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
