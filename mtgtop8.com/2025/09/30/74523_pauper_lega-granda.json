Ram Through and Malevolent Rumble are included for removal and damage, while Arbor Elf and Writhing Chrysalis help generate additional mana. Nyxborn Hydra, Bannerhide Krushok, and Avenging Hunter are powerful threats that can close out the game quickly. The deck aims to apply pressure from the start and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of ramp, removal, and efficient creatures."
