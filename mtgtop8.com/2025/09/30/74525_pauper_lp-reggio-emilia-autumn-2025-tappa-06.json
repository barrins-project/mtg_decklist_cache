The main strategy is to generate value from sacrificing artifacts and creatures, while disrupting the opponent with removal spells. The deck also utilizes land destruction and reanimation effects to control the board and gain card advantage. The key to success lies in properly sequencing spells and utilizing the graveyard effectively to outpace the opponent and secure victory."
