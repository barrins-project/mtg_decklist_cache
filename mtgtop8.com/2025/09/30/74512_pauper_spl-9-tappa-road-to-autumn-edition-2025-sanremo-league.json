Writhing Chrysalis, Boarding Party, and Eldrazi Repurposer provide additional threats, while Malevolent Rumble and Avenging Hunter can deal with opposing creatures. Mwonvuli Acid-Moss and Thermokarst disrupt the opponent's mana base, helping to maintain a tempo advantage. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and efficient removal spells while capitalizing on its mana ramping abilities."
