It also emphasizes removal and resource denial through land destruction and graveyard hate. The aggressive strategy aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly with a mix of creatures, removal spells, and recursion effects. By efficiently utilizing the resources available and leveraging the synergies between the different cards, the deck can create a powerful and oppressive board state that is difficult for the opponent to deal with effectively."
