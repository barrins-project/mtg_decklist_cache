It includes cards that can ramp up mana quickly, dig for key pieces of the combo, and control the board with removal spells. The key strategy is to get Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle on the battlefield along with multiple mountains, then play Primeval Titan to search for more mountains and trigger Valakut's ability multiple times in a single turn to burn the opponent out. The deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can establish a strong board presence."
