The deck aims to win without needing to rely on traditional lands, using cards like Hydroelectric Specimen and Tameshi, Reality Architect to control the board. It also includes a mix of counterspells like Stern Scolding and Disrupting Shoal to protect its combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
