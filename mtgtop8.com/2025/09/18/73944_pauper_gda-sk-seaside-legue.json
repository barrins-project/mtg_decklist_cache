            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly playing efficient and powerful green creatures to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive attacks. By ramping up mana with cards like Arbor Elf, Utopia Sprawl, and Wild Growth, the deck can play its threats ahead of schedule and maintain pressure. Cards like Avenging Hunter and Nyxborn Hydra provide big bodies that are difficult to deal with, while Malevolent Rumble and Ram Through help clear the way for attacks. Overall, the deck aims to quickly establish a dominant board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

It also includes graveyard hate to disrupt opponents who rely on graveyard interactions. The deck has a focus on resource management and synergy between cards to create a fast-paced and disruptive game plan."
