By utilizing cards that provide card advantage and mana fixing, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of synergistic pieces such as Refurbished Familiar and Myr Enforcer allows for powerful combos and efficient beatdown strategies. The mana base is also carefully constructed to support the artifact theme of the deck. Overall, this deck excels at aggressive strategies with a focus on artifacts."
