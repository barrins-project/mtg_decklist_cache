By utilizing evasive creatures like Faeries and Ninjas, along with efficient counter spells, the goal is to establish board control and apply pressure early in the game. The inclusion of card draw and bounce spells helps maintain card advantage and tempo, allowing the deck to outmaneuver the opponent and secure the win. The mono blue color identity provides consistency and flexibility in spell choices."
