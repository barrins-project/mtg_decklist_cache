The use of The One Ring and Karn, the Great Creator adds further utility and control options to the deck, allowing for a versatile and potent strategy in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."

The deck also includes powerful removal spells like Fury and Sundering Eruption to deal with threats. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Chrome Mox for ramp and acceleration. The aim is to quickly overwhelm the opponent and control the game through disruptive elements and fast threats."
