The deck aims to stall the game with cards like Counterspell and Snuff Out while digging for key pieces with Brainstorm and Ponder. Murmuring Mystic provides a win condition by generating bird tokens, while Gurmag Angler offers a big threat. Unexpected Fangs can provide additional card advantage and life gain, helping the player stay ahead in the game. The deck utilizes a mix of creatures, removal spells, and counterspells to control the game and secure victory."
