With cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, Eye of the Storms, the deck can disrupt opponents' strategies while deploying threats of its own. By using a combination of removal spells and disruptive creatures like Thought-Knot Seer, the deck can maintain board control and overwhelm opponents with its powerful late-game threats. The key concept revolves around efficiently using mana resources to dominate the game and outvalue opponents."

By using cards like Coiling Oracle and Ice-Fang Coatl for early board presence, and Quantum Riddler and Abhorrent Oculus for damage, the deck aims to control the game tempo and finish off the opponent with powerful finishers like Harbinger of the Seas and Hydroelectric Specimen. The inclusion of counterspells like Flare of Denial and Force of Negation adds an element of protection to ensure the deck's strategy goes smoothly."
