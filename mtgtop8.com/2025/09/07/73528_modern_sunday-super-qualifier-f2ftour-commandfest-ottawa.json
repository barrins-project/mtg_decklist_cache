The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Chalice of the Void and Thought-Knot Seer, and ultimately overwhelm them with big threats like Sire of Seven Deaths and Ugin, the Eye of the Storms. The deck also includes removal spells like Dismember and board wipes like All Is Dust to maintain board control."
