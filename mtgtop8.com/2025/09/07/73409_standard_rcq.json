By utilizing cards like Marauding Mako, Steamcore Scholar, and Vivi Ornitier, along with efficient spells like Abrade and Fear of Missing Out, the deck aims to control the board and maintain pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Proft's Eidetic Memory and Into the Flood Maw also provides versatility and options for dealing with different threats. Overall, the deck focuses on establishing an early advantage and closing out the game quickly."
