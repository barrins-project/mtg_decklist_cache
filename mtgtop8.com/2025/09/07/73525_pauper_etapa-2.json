By combining creatures like Nyxborn Hydra and Refurbished Familiar with powerful removal spells like Galvanic Blast and Cast Down, the deck can quickly apply pressure to the opponent while keeping the board clear. Additionally, cards like Krark-Clan Shaman and Writhing Chrysalis provide additional ways to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes some graveyard hate with Nihil Spellbomb and potential card draw with Ichor Wellspring to maintain card advantage."
