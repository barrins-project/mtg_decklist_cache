Additionally, the deck includes some resilience and recursion through cards like Supernatural Stamina and Reaping the Graves to continue the aggressive strategy even after losing creatures.

By utilizing cards like Krark-Clan Shaman, Fanatical Offering, and Cleansing Wildfire, the deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent while also limiting their resources. The inclusion of Refurbished Familiar and Writhing Chrysalis provides additional ways to generate value and maintain board presence.
