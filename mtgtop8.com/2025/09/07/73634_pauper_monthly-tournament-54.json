By utilizing cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Goblin Bushwhacker to quickly ramp up the board, paired with efficient burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt to finish off opponents or clear blockers, this deck aims to end the game as quickly as possible. The inclusion of cards like Rally at the Hornburg and Reckless Impulse helps maintain card advantage and keep up the pressure on the opponent."
