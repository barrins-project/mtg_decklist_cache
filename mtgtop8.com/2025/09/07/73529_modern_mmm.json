Using cards like Ornithopter and Memnite to enable affinity abilities, the deck also aims to flood the board with creatures like Kappa Cannoneer and Pinnacle Emissary, overwhelming opponents with aggressive attacks. Thought Monitor and Urza's Saga provide card advantage and additional threats, while the inclusion of utility cards like Aether Spellbomb and Claws of Gix offer flexibility in dealing with opponent's strategies. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain a strong presence on the battlefield."
