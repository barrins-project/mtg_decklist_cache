The inclusion of Aether Vial helps to cheat in creatures at instant speed, giving the deck flexibility and unpredictability in its gameplay."

By cycling through creatures like Street Wraith and Curator of Mysteries, and using cards like Subtlety and Endurance to disrupt the opponent's strategy, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent with a massive board presence after casting Living End. The inclusion of Shardless Agent and Windcaller Aven provides additional value and consistency to the deck's game plan, making it a formidable force in Modern 1 vs 1 matchups."
