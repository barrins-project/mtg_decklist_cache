It aims to overwhelm the opponent with repeated attacks and sacrifice effects using Carrion Feeder and Bloodthrone Vampire, while also gaining advantage with cards like Perigee Beckoner and Village Rites. The deck also includes some graveyard recursion with cards like Unearth and Shambling Ghast to keep the pressure on the opponent."
