By utilizing cards like Winternight Stories, Proft's Eidetic Memory, and Fear of Missing Out, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence while disrupting the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of cards like Marauding Mako and Steamcore Scholar provide additional pressure, while Quantum Riddler and Vivi Ornitier offer card advantage and flexibility. Overall, the deck focuses on applying early pressure and maintaining tempo advantage to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."
