It includes cards that support the Affinity mechanic, such as Myr Enforcer and Thoughtcast, as well as removal and card draw options. By sacrificing artifacts with cards like Makeshift Munitions and Krark-Clan Shaman, players can deal damage to their opponent while also triggering synergies with other cards in the deck. The deck aims to establish early board presence and pressure opponents with a steady stream of damage."

By consistently applying early pressure and disrupting the opponent's plays, the deck aims to overwhelm and defeat the opponent before they can establish a strong defense. The combination of cheap creatures, card draw, and counterspells allows the deck to maintain a fast and aggressive playstyle throughout the game."
