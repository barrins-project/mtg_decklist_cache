With a mix of creatures that can be sacrificed for benefit and ways to trigger those sacrifices, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and resilience. The inclusion of artifact lands enhances the mana base and synergizes well with cards like Cleansing Wildfire. Overall, this deck is designed to be proactive and disruptive, forcing opponents to react to its constant pressure."
