The deck also includes Sunscape Familiar to reduce the cost of instants and sorceries, enabling more efficient spells to be cast. Mulldrifter and Sea Gate Oracle provide card advantage while cards like Negate and Prohibit offer counterspells to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of Archaeomancer and Meeting of Minds allows for recursion of key cards and additional card draw, making it a versatile and resilient control deck in the Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
