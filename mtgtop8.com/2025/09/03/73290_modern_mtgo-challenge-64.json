The key strategy is to empty the opponent's library as fast as possible, utilizing efficient mill cards and removal spells to disrupt their game plan.

By pairing these spells with cards like Atraxa, Grand Unifier and Teferi, Time Raveler, the deck can control the game and disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up its own combo win condition. Using cards like Faithful Mending and Ephemerate to help filter through the deck and protect key pieces, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo and overwhelm the opponent before they can react."
