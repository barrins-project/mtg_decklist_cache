The deck also utilizes efficient mana acceleration with cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Chrome Mox to power out its big threats early on.

It utilizes efficient removal and hand disruption spells to control the game early on, while using powerful creatures like Baleful Strix and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to provide a steady stream of threats. The inclusion of Life from the Loam allows for consistent land drops and graveyard recursion, while cards like Scythecat Cub and Traveling Chocobo provide additional aggressive options. The mana base is built to support a variety of colors for the deck's versatile spells and creatures."
