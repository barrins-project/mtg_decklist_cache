Thought Scour and Brainstorm help to draw cards and filter through the deck efficiently. Boomerang and Sleep of the Dead provide additional disruption, while Lórien Revealed boosts the power of creatures. The deck aims to win by overwhelming the opponent with early aggression and efficient card advantage."
