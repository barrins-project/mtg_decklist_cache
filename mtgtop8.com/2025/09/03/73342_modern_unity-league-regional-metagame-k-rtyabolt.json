By utilizing creatures like Fallaji Archaeologist, Thundertrap Trainer, and Hydroelectric Specimen alongside spells like Sink into Stupor and Whir of Invention, the deck can quickly assemble its combo pieces and win the game. Disrupting Shoal and Spell Snare are included to disrupt opponent's plays, while cards like Stern Scolding and Flare of Denial provide additional control. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful combo while maintaining control of the game."
