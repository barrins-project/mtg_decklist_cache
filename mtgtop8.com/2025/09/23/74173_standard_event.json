The deck includes powerful creatures like Nova Hellkite and Emberheart Challenger, along with burn spells such as Burst Lightning and Scorching Shot to deal damage directly to the opponent or remove opposing threats. The goal is to apply early pressure and maintain a fast-paced tempo to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. Additional utility cards like Abrade and Opera Love Song provide versatility and support to the aggro strategy."
