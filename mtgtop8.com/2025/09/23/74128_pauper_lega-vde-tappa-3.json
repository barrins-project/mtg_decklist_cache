Using efficient spells like Delver of Secrets and Sneaky Snacker, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent while keeping control of the game through counterspells like Counterspell and Spell Pierce. By utilizing card draw spells like Deep Analysis and Thought Scour, the deck can maintain card advantage and consistently apply pressure on the opponent. This aggressive strategy is supported by the inclusion of disruptive spells like Dispel and Cryptic Serpent to protect the game plan."
