The deck aims to apply pressure early on with cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Slickshot Show-Off, while also including key disruptive spells like Thoughtseize to control the opponent's game plan. The deck also features cards that allow for card advantage and flexibility, such as Light Up the Stage and Finale of Promise. Overall, the strategy revolves around fast, direct damage to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
