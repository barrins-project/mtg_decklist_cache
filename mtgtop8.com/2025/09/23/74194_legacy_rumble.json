The deck also includes counterspells like Force of Will to protect your combo pieces and card draw engines like Brainstorm and Ponder to help find your combo pieces quickly. The mana base includes fast mana sources like Chrome Mox and City of Traitors to facilitate casting your expensive spells early in the game. Overall, this deck aims to win the game by quickly putting powerful threats into play and overwhelming the opponent."

The deck includes a suite of efficient removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Solitude, as well as powerful card draw and selection with Brainstorm and Ponder. The win condition is a mix of creatures like Murktide Regent and Quantum Riddler, supported by planeswalkers like Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd. The land base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize consistency."

By using cards like Mother of Runes and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while building up a powerful army of creatures. Through synergies like Thalia's Lieutenant and Champion of the Parish, as well as strong finishers like Zack Fair and Voice of Victory, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently. Additionally, the inclusion of disruptive lands like Karakas and Wasteland adds another layer of control to the strategy."
