The inclusion of cards like Cabal Therapy and Thoughtseize helps to strip key cards from the opponent's hand, while Static Prison and Goblin Bombardment provide additional disruption and reach respectively. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive strategy with a mix of fetch lands and dual lands."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly cast as many spells as possible to win the game in one turn. The deck aims to use cards like Dark Ritual, Lotus Petal, and Simian Spirit Guide to generate mana quickly and then play cards like Balustrade Spy and Undercity Informer to flip the entire library into the graveyard. This allows cards like Narcomoeba and Dread Return to be triggered, ultimately leading to a win condition with Thassa's Oracle. The deck also includes disruption cards like Duress and Thoughtseize to protect the combo."
