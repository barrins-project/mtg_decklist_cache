By utilizing the Urza lands to quickly ramp up your mana, you can cast big threats like Thought-Knot Seer and Karn, the Great Creator early in the game. The deck also includes powerful removal spells like Dismember and All Is Dust to deal with any threats your opponent may play. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with high-impact plays and powerful control elements."
