The key strategy is to create a fast and aggressive board presence, taking advantage of hexproof creatures like Slippery Bogle and Gladecover Scout to protect them from removal spells. By stacking auras like Ethereal Armor, Rancor, and Ancestral Mask onto the creatures, the deck aims to create lethal threats that can quickly close out the game. Additionally, cards like Utopia Sprawl and Abundant Growth help to ramp up mana production and ensure a smooth curve of plays."

The Gates provide additional utility by fixing mana for the deck's multiple colors and providing extra card draw and life gain effects. This synergy allows the deck to outvalue opponents and control the game until victory."
