By utilizing efficient creatures like Kitchen Imp and Voldaren Epicure, alongside removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fiery Temper, the deck aims to control the board and push through damage. Additional card draw and life gain from Faithless Looting and Alms of the Vein help to sustain the aggression, while cards like Demand Answers and Grab the Prize provide additional removal and disruption for the opponent."
