By using cards like Disrupting Shoal and Suppression Ray to control the game early, the deck can quickly set up powerful combos like Goblin Charbelcher and Thundertrap Trainer to finish off the opponent. The key strategy is to efficiently disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up your own win condition through powerful spells and creatures, ultimately overwhelming them before they can establish a strong board presence."
