By milling the entire deck, the player can bring back creatures from the graveyard with Dread Return, ultimately winning the game with a massive creature like Lotleth Giant. The deck also includes cards like Winding Way and Lead the Stampede to filter through the deck and find key combo pieces. The strategy focuses on quickly assembling the combo and overwhelming the opponent."
