Using a combination of disruptive spells like Counterspell and Thoughtseize, removal like Fatal Push and Dismember, and card advantage engines like Murktide Regent and Thought Scour, the deck aims to control the tempo of the game and eventually win through efficient threats like Subtlety and Abhorrent Oculus. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's heavy reliance on blue and black spells."

The deck utilizes the Urza lands (Urza's Mine, Power Plant, and Tower) to generate a large amount of mana quickly, allowing for the early casting of big threats like Emrakul and Thought-Knot Seer. Karn, the Great Creator is included to shut down artifact-based strategies and Ugin, Eye of the Storms provides additional removal and card advantage. The deck aims to dominate the late game with its powerful threats and control elements."

Removal spells like Solitude and Wrath of the Skies deal with threats, while Quantum Riddler and Tune the Narrative provide card selection and advantage. The deck aims to maintain control of the game until it can win through incremental advantage."
