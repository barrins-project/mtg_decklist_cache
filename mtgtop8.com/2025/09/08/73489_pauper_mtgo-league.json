It utilizes cards like Carrion Feeder and Nested Shambler for sacrifice value, while also maintaining card advantage with Village Rites and Perigee Beckoner. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and efficient creature removal spells like Rite of Consumption and Supernatural Stamina. With a mix of creature sacrifice effects and creature pump spells, this deck seeks to close out games quickly through aggressive and efficient tactics."

Additionally, cards like Prismatic Strands and Thraben Charm provide protection against combat-oriented strategies. The creatures in the deck serve as blockers or additional sources of card advantage."
