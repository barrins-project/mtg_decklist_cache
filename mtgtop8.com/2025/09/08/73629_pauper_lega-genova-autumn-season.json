Cards like Bloodthrone Vampire, Carrion Feeder, and Mortician Beetle benefit from sacrifice effects, while cards like Village Rites and Rite of Consumption provide card advantage and direct damage. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures and use sacrifice effects to buff key creatures for a final, lethal attack."
