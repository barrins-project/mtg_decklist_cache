            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy focused on playing multiple artifacts to reduce the cost of cards and take advantage of affinity mechanics. By quickly building up a board presence with cheap artifacts and utilizing synergies, the deck aims to deal damage efficiently and consistently to secure a win. The inclusion of cards like Galvanic Blast and Reckoner's Bargain further enhances the aggressive game plan, while providing additional utility and card advantage to maintain pressure on the opponent."
