            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and powerful burn spells. By playing efficient, low-cost creatures like Emberheart Challenger and Hired Claw, combined with direct damage spells like Burst Lightning and Abrade, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. The addition of creatures with abilities like Menace and Flying, such as Nova Hellkite and Sunspine Lynx, helps to push for damage and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The deck also includes some disruptive cards like Self-Destruct to clear the way for your creatures."
