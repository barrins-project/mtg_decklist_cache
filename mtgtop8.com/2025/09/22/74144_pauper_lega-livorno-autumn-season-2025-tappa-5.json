By utilizing cards like Arbor Elf, Wild Growth, and Utopia Sprawl, the deck aims to ramp up mana production early on to play big threats like Nyxborn Hydra and Eldrazi Repurposer. Malevolent Rumble can clear the way for attacks while cards like Oliphaunt and Ram Through provide additional utility. Overall, the deck prioritizes speed and efficiency in order to outpace the opponent and secure victory."
