The inclusion of Mulldrifter and Sea Gate Oracle provides additional card draw and filtering options. LÃ³rien Revealed can add extra mana acceleration, while Prohibit and Negate offer counterplay against key threats. The deck also has a backup win condition in Murmuring Mystic. Overall, the deck's strategy is to grind out wins through efficient resource management and incremental advantage."
