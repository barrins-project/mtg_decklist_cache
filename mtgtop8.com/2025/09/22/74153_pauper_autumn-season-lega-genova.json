The inclusion of Mulldrifter and Sea Gate Oracle provides additional card draw and filtering options. Lórien Revealed can add extra mana acceleration, while Prohibit and Negate offer counterplay against key threats. The deck also has a backup win condition in Murmuring Mystic. Overall, the deck's strategy is to grind out wins through efficient resource management and incremental advantage."
