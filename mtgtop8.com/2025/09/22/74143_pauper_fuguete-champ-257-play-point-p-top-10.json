By utilizing Myr Retriever and Pactdoll Terror, you can create a loop to recur powerful artifacts and generate value. The deck also includes ways to gain life with Fangren Marauder and Blood Fountain, as well as finish off opponents with Eviscerator's Insight. The overall strategy revolves around mana ramp, card advantage, and controlling the game until you can overwhelm your opponent with powerful threats."
