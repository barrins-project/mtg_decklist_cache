The deck is designed to protect this combo with counterspells like Force of Will and disruption using cards like Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student. The mana base is optimized for consistency and allows for quick fetching with cards like Flooded Strand and Misty Rainforest. It is a powerful and streamlined strategy that aims to win the game in just a few turns."
