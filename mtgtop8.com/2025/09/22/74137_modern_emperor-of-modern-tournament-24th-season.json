It includes various removal spells and board wipes like All Is Dust and Kozilek's Command to deal with threats. The deck also features planeswalkers like Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to provide additional control and advantage. The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan and overwhelm them with powerful creatures and spells."
