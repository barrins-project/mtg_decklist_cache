It includes a mix of Eldrazi creatures, powerful artifacts, and removal spells to control the game and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The key strategy is to ramp up quickly with the UrzaTron lands, play threats like Karn, the Great Creator and Thought-Knot Seer, and use removal spells like Kozilek's Command to stay ahead. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent and win through overwhelming board presence and efficient removal."
