The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of efficient creatures and removal spells, all while taking advantage of the affinity mechanic to cast spells for reduced costs. The deck also includes cards like Blood Fountain and Cryogen Relic to support the aggressive strategy and keep the pressure on the opponent."
