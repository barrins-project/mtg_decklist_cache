Key cards like Steamcore Scholar, Marauding Mako, and Fear of Missing Out provide early pressure, while Tersa Lightshatter and Vivi Ornitier offer additional threats. Quantum Riddler helps with card advantage, and Agatha's Soul Cauldron can generate additional resources. The deck also includes removal spells like Abrade and Into the Flood Maw, as well as utility cards like Wild Ride and Winternight Stories. Overall, the deck aims to be fast and efficient in its game plan."
