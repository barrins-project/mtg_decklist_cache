The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Spellstutter Sprite and Snuff Out while also generating card advantage through cards like Augur of Bolas and Ninja of the Deep Hours. By efficiently controlling the board and hand, the deck tries to establish a dominant position and ultimately win the game through grinding out the opponent or by establishing a powerful threat like Gurmag Angler."
