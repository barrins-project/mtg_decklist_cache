It utilizes cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to ramp up mana production and enable explosive plays. By leveraging cards like Thoughtcast and Thought Monitor to draw additional cards, the deck can maintain a steady flow of threats while pressuring the opponent. Cards like Arcbound Ravager and Weapons Manufacturing provide additional ways to pump up creatures and close out games quickly. The strategy revolves around overwhelming opponents with a swarm of artifacts and efficient threats."
