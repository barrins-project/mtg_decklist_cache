            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the game through the use of powerful Eldrazi creatures and the Urza lands (Tower, Power Plant, Mine) to generate massive amounts of mana. Karn, the Great Creator acts as a versatile threat and utility card, while Ugin, Eye of the Storms provides board control. Expedition Map helps to find key lands, and Thought-Knot Seer disrupts the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to establish dominance through resource manipulation and powerful threats, ultimately winning through overwhelming board presence and control."
