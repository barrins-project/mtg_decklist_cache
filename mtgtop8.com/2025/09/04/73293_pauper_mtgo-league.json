It utilizes cards that benefit from playing artifacts such as Thoughtcast and Cryogen Relic, while also including removal spells like Cast Down to control the board. The deck's mana base is heavily focused on artifact lands like Seat of the Synod and Vault of Whispers to enable the affinity mechanic and allow for explosive starts. Overall, the strategy revolves around exploiting the synergy between artifacts and creatures to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent."
