It also has some control elements with Force of Will, Daze, and Thoughtseize to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures like Archon of Cruelty and Atraxa, Grand Unifier, while also having ways to deal with problematic permanents with Orcish Bowmasters and Wasteland."
