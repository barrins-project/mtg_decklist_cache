            "notes": "The main idea behind this Mono Green Aggro deck is to quickly ramp up mana using cards like Arbor Elf, Utopia Sprawl, and Wild Growth, allowing you to play big threats like Nyxborn Hydra and Eldrazi Repurposer early in the game. Avenging Hunter and Bannerhide Krushok provide aggressive creatures that can deal damage quickly, while Jewel Thief and Malevolent Rumble help to control the board. Ram Through is used for removal and Writhing Chrysalis can be a surprise finisher. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and efficient mana ramp."
