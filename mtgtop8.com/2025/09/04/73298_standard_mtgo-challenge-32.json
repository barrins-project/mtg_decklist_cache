It focuses on quickly deploying threats like Vivi Ornitier and Steamcore Scholar while utilizing card draw and spell recursion with cards like Proft's Eidetic Memory and Winternight Stories. Fear of Missing Out and Quantum Riddler provide additional pressure, while Abrade and Obliterating Bolt offer removal options. The deck also includes some land manipulation with Riverpyre Verge and Thundering Falls, allowing for flexibility in mana generation. Overall, the goal is to maintain a fast-paced, aggressive playstyle to outpace the opponent and secure victory."
