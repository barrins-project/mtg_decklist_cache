By controlling your opponent's resources with cards like Fatal Push and Drown in the Loch, and disrupting their strategy with Tasha's Hideous Laughter and Surgical Extraction, you can grind them down until they have no cards left to draw. Utilizing cards like Preordain and Visions of Beyond to dig through your deck, this combo-focused UB Mill deck aims to win by emptying your opponent's library before they can win through traditional means."
