By utilizing cards like Myr Enforcer and Reckoner's Bargain, the deck can swarm the board with powerful creatures while also utilizing cards like Galvanic Blast to deal damage directly to the opponent. The inclusion of artifacts like Drossforge Bridge and Mistvault Bridge also helps to support the deck's aggressive playstyle. Additionally, cards like Thoughtcast and Vault of Whispers provide card draw and mana fixing to maintain a steady flow of resources throughout the game."
