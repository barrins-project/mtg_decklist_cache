By combining creatures like Slippery Bogle and Silhana Ledgewalker with auras such as Ancestral Mask and Ethereal Armor, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with large, hexproof creatures. Supporting cards like Abundant Growth and Utopia Sprawl help to fix mana and ramp up quickly, while cards like Malevolent Rumble and Armadillo Cloak provide additional removal and life gain options. The deck's strategy revolves around building a fast and powerful board presence to quickly take down opponents."
