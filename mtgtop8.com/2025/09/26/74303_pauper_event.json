The deck focuses on creating a powerful board presence through reanimation and overwhelming the opponent with large creatures. The inclusion of cards like Gnaw to the Bone and Malevolent Rumble also allows for staying power and disruption against aggressive decks. Overall, the deck aims to combo off by reanimating strong creatures to win the game."
