The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game by playing efficient threats like Reality Smasher and Eldrazi Linebreaker, while also utilizing powerful lands like Eye of Ugin and Eldrazi Temple to cast its high-cost Eldrazi creatures. It also includes disruption cards like Wasteland and Glaring Fleshraker to control the opponent's resources and secure victory through fast and relentless aggression."
