The deck also includes disruptive elements like Mistcaller and Harbinger of the Seas to control the opponent's board. Standstill and Sink into Stupor slow down the opponent's game plan, allowing the Merfolk to overwhelm them with their strategic synergy and aggression."

It uses cards like Cloudpost, Urza's Tower, and Glimmerpost to ramp up mana production, allowing for early plays of huge threats like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Karn, the Great Creator. The deck also includes disruption cards like Force of Will and Chalice of the Void to protect its combo pieces. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with big spells and threatening board presence."
