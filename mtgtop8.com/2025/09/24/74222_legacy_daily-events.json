Mishra's Bauble and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student provide card advantage and selection, while Lightning Bolt and Cori-Steel Cutter offer versatile removal options. The mana base is streamlined with fetchlands and dual lands, alongside Wasteland for disruption. The deck aims to control the board early on and close out the game quickly with a mix of direct damage and evasive threats."
