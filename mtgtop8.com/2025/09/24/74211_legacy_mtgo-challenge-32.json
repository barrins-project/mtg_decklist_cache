With a mix of threats and answers, the deck can adapt to different matchups and strategies, making it a versatile and deadly combo reanimator archetype in Legacy 1 vs 1 format."

The deck also includes various artifacts to support the combo, including Voltaic Key and Basalt Monolith for additional mana acceleration, as well as Urza's lands and Karn, the Great Creator for further utility. The goal is to assemble a powerful combination of cards that can generate a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent with a powerful combo finish."
