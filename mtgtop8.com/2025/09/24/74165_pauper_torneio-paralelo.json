The deck also includes some control elements with cards like Thraben Charm and Raffine's Informant. The creatures in the deck have flying or other abilities to help push through damage, and there are a few support cards like Dawnbringer Cleric and Greatsword of Tyr to provide additional options. Overall, the strategy focuses on fast, aggressive plays to overwhelm the opponent."
