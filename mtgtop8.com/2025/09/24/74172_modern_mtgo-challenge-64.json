By using cards like Whir of Invention and Lotus Bloom to ramp up mana and then deploying powerful cards like Goblin Charbelcher and Tameshi, Reality Architect, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and control elements. The inclusion of counterspells and disruptive spells like Jwari Disruption and Suppression Ray further solidify the deck's ability to disrupt the opponent's plans while maintaining its own strategy."
