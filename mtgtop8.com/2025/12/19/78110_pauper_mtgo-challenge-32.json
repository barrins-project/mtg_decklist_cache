By sacrificing artifacts for additional effects, the deck gains card advantage and can quickly overwhelm opponents with a combination of creature attacks and direct damage spells. The synergy between cards like Myr Enforcer, Galvanic Blast, and Drossforge Bridge allows for a fast-paced, high-powered approach that aims to defeat the opponent before they can establish a strong defense. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Thoughtcast provide utility and card draw to keep the deck running smoothly."

By playing cards like Galvanic Blast and Krark-Clan Shaman, the deck can deal with the opponent's threats efficiently. Additionally, with Thoughtcast and Reckoner's Bargain, the deck can draw cards to keep up the pressure. The inclusion of Nihil Spellbomb also disrupts graveyard strategies. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and artifact synergies."
