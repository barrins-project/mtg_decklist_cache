It aims to take advantage of the synergy between ramp cards like Arboreal Grazer and Omnath, Locus of Creation to quickly overwhelm the opponent with big threats. The inclusion of control spells like Get Lost and Earthbender Ascension helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up for a strong late-game with cards like Nissa, Resurgent Animist and Titan of Industry. The deck also utilizes Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion for additional value and flexibility."
