The goal is to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent to create tempo advantage while utilizing cards like Lotus Petal and Chrome Mox to accelerate mana production. The land base supports the aggressive strategy by providing fast mana and fixing colors for the deck's spells. The deck aims to stay ahead in tempo and pressure the opponent to close out the game quickly."
