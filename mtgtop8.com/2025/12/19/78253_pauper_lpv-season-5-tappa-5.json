Tolarian Terror is used as a win condition to finish off opponents once they have been sufficiently slowed down. The inclusion of spells like Sleep of the Dead and Deem Inferior provide additional control options, while cards like Thought Scour and Ponder help dig for key pieces of the strategy. Overall, the deck aims to outlast opponents and secure victory through careful planning and resource management."
