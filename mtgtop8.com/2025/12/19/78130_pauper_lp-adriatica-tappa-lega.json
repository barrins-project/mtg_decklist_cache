The deck focuses on card advantage and board control, with tools like Preordain, Prohibit, and Snap to manipulate the game state. God-Pharaoh's Faithful and Cryogen Relic help to stabilize against aggressive strategies, while Lórien Revealed and Sunscape Familiar reduce the cost of spells. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent with its efficient control cards and resource management."
