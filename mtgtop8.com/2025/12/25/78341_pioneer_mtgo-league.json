By ramping up with mana dorks like Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves, the deck aims to cast powerful green creatures such as Cavalier of Thorns and Old-Growth Troll. Cards like Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx provide additional mana acceleration and card draw. Storm the Festival helps to find key creatures quickly, while Boseiju, Who Endures protects against countermagic. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, resilient threats."
