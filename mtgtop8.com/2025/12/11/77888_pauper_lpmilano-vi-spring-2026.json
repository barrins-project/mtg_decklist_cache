The deck plays a variety of removal spells and card draw effects to maintain board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The key strategy is to constantly apply pressure and keep the opponent on the back foot while generating card advantage through sacrificing and recurring creatures. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the color requirements of the deck while also providing utility with cards like Twisted Landscape and Cleansing Wildfire."
