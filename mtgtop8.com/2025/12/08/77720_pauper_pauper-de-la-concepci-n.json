            "notes": "This Pauper aggro deck focuses on explosive plays and quick wins by boosting creatures with cheap spells like Mutagenic Growth and Temur Battle Rage. The key strategy is to pump up creatures like Kiln Fiend and Festival Crasher with spells and then use cards like Reckless Charge and Assault Strobe to land big hits and close out the game quickly. The deck is built around fast, high-risk plays that aim to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a solid defense."
