By utilizing cards like Carrion Feeder, Bloodthrone Vampire, and Mortician Beetle, the deck can take advantage of sacrificing creatures to grow stronger and trigger abilities. Supernatural Stamina and Rite of Consumption provide additional utility by protecting key creatures and dealing direct damage. With a focus on sacrificing and creature recursion, this deck aims to apply continuous pressure and steadily chip away at the opponent's life total."
