It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of burn spells and aggressive creatures that can quickly reduce their life total. The deck benefits from cards that deal damage directly to the opponent or their creatures, as well as cards that allow for card draw and additional mana acceleration to maintain pressure on the opponent. The key strategy is to deplete the opponent's life total before they can stabilize and mount a defense."

With cards like Myr Enforcer and Reckoner's Bargain, this deck can quickly build up a large board presence. Thoughtcast allows for drawing additional cards and Galvanic Blast provides direct damage to finish off opponents. The deck is also supplemented with removal spells like Krark-Clan Shaman and Nihil Spellbomb to disrupt opponent's strategies. By efficiently utilizing artifacts and synergies within the deck, this Aggro - Affinity archetype aims to quickly defeat opponents in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
