Additionally, cards like Dark Ritual and Sinkhole help accelerate the deck's game plan by disrupting the opponent's mana base. The inclusion of Thoughtseize and Fatal Push provides additional disruption, while cards like Sheoldred's Edict and Orcish Bowmasters help control the board. The deck also includes utility lands like Wasteland for resource denial and Raucous Theater for card advantage."

The deck's combo potential is amplified by the presence of Allosaurus Shepherd to protect against counter magic.
