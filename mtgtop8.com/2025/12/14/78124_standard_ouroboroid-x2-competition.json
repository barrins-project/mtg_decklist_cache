It includes creatures to protect you while setting up your combo, along with card draw and tutoring spells to find the necessary pieces. Roiling Dragonstorm is used as a win condition once Omniscience is on the battlefield. The deck also includes a mix of lands to ensure you have the mana you need to cast your spells. The key strategy is to ramp up quickly and play Omniscience to overwhelm your opponent with powerful spells."
