The deck focuses on utilizing efficient creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer, Territorial Kavu, and Scion of Draco, along with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Leyline Binding. It also includes cards like Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury and Nulldrifter for additional threats and card advantage. The mana base is flexible to support the diverse color requirements of the deck, allowing for consistent and explosive plays."
