This allows for explosive plays and the ability to overwhelm opponents with aggressive attacks and creature buffs. Additional cards like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to dig deeper into the deck and refill the hand with more Elves, ensuring a steady stream of threats. Overall, the deck aims to build a strong board presence and push for a quick victory through relentless aggression."
