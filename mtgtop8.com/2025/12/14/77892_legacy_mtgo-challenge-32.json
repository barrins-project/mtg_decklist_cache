It uses a combination of fast mana, discard spells, and creatures that enable you to accomplish this goal as early as the first turn. The deck is built to be a high-risk, high-reward strategy that can win out of nowhere if the opponent is unprepared to deal with such an explosive combo. It aims to create a fast and powerful combo that can overwhelm opponents before they have a chance to react."
