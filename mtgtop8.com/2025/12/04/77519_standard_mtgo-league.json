            "notes": "The key concept of this Gruul Aggro deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy. This deck focuses on playing efficient creatures like Patchwork Beastie and Wildfire Wickerfolk, while also including combat tricks and removal spells like Lightning Strike and Bushwhack to push through damage and control the board. With cards like Break Out and Overprotect to protect key creatures, and a solid mana base to support the aggressive curve, this deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board presence to secure victory."
