By ramping up mana production, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures, while also benefitting from multiple card draw spells to maintain a consistent stream of threats. The inclusion of cards like Avenging Hunter and Timberwatch Elf highlight the aggressive nature of the deck, allowing for explosive turns that can quickly end the game in the player's favor."
