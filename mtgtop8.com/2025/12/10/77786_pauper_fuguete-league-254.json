By utilizing mana accelerators like Elvish Mystic and Priest of Titania, the deck can quickly ramp up to play high-powered creatures like Timberwatch Elf and Nyxborn Hydra. Masked Vandal provides removal for any troublesome artifacts or enchantments, while Wellwisher helps to stall out the game against other aggro decks. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way keep the Elf engine running smoothly, ensuring a consistent flow of threats to keep the pressure on the opponent."
