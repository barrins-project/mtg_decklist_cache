By utilizing artifact creatures and spells, as well as cost reduction effects, the deck aims to maintain a high tempo and pressure the opponent early on. The inclusion of removal and card draw spells helps to maintain control of the game while continuously putting pressure on the opponent's life total. The deck's mana base is optimized to support its aggressive game plan."
