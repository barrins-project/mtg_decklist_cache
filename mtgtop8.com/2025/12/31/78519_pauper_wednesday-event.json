By using efficient creatures like Thraben Inspector and Kor Skyfisher, along with token generators like Battle Screech, the deck can put constant pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Prismatic Strands and Guardians' Pledge provides protection and additional firepower, while Idyllic Grange helps to pump up the creatures. Overall, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and maintain it throughout the game to secure victory."
