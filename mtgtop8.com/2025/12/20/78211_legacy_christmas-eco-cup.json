By combining aggressive threats like Murktide Regent and Orcish Bowmasters with efficient removal like Fatal Push and Thoughtseize, the deck aims to keep the opponent on the back foot while pressuring them to make suboptimal plays. The inclusion of counterspells like Force of Will and Daze further enhances the deck's ability to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain its own tempo advantage. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility, allowing for smooth gameplay and powerful plays."

The deck utilizes cards like Chrome Mox, Lion's Eye Diamond, and Dark Ritual to accelerate mana production, while cards like Beseech the Mirror and Gamble allow for card selection. Echo of Eons can then be used to refill the hand and continue the combo. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and win the game in a single explosive turn."
