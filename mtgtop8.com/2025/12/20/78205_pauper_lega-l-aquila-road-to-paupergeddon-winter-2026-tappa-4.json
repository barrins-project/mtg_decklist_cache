By utilizing cheap counterspells and card draw, the deck aims to control the game while attacking with aggressive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent. The inclusion of bounce spells like Sleep of the Dead further disrupts opponents' plans, allowing for swift victory through a combination of board control and creature aggression. With a low mana curve and a focus on tempo, this deck aims to apply pressure from the start and maintain dominance throughout the game."
