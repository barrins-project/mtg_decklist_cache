By using cards like Bloodthrone Vampire and Mortician Beetle in combination with sacrifice outlets like Carrion Feeder and Infestation Sage, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays. Cards like Sadistic Glee and Rite of Consumption can provide additional burst damage, while removal spells like Snuff Out help keep the opponent's board clear. Overall, the deck is designed to be fast-paced and relentless in its attacks."
