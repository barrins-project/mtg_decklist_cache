By efficiently disrupting the opponent's game plan and maintaining pressure with a mix of high-value threats and efficient removal, the deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent in a tempo-driven game plan. The key is to control the board while maintaining a fast clock to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
