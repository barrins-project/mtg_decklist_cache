It also utilizes cards like Vanishing Verse and Fatal Push to deal with opposing threats. The inclusion of Thoughtseize and Duress helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Preacher of the Schism and Elspeth, Storm Slayer provide additional threats and win conditions. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent casting of spells."
