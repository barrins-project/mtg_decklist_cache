The deck also includes removal spells like Cast Down and aggressive burn spells like Galvanic Blast to clear the way for attacking. Additionally, the deck features artifact synergy with cards like Cleansing Wildfire and Drossforge Bridge to improve consistency and card advantage. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive board presence while disrupting their resources."
