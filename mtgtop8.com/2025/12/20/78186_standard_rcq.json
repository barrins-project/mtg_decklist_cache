By utilizing cards like Boomerang Basics and Torch the Tower to control the board and deal damage, combined with strong creatures like Thundertrap Trainer and Badgermole Cub, the deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Enduring Vitality and Valley Floodcaller also provides additional resilience and utility to maintain pressure on the opponent."
