By utilizing cards like Counterspell and Spell Pierce, it aims to control the board while also maintaining card advantage with cards like Ninja of the Deep Hours and Of One Mind. With a low mana curve and a focus on tempo, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and quickly close out the game before they can stabilize."
