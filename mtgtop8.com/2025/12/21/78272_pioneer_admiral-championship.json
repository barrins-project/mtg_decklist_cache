By generating mana with cards like Mox Amber and Stock Up, as well as manipulating the library with cards like Sleight of Hand and Sea Gate Restoration, the deck aims to establish an overwhelming board presence and outvalue the opponent. The inclusion of disruptive elements like Spell Pierce and Boomerang Basics helps to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
