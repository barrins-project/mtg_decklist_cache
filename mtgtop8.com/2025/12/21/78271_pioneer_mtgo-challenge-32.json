The inclusion of cards like Academic Dispute and Stock Up helps to maintain card advantage and keep the pressure up throughout the game. The mana base is optimized to ensure consistent access to the necessary colors for spells."

Collected Company provides additional creature support, while Thalia, Guardian of Thraben disrupts opponent's spells. The inclusion of Aven Interrupter and Enduring Innocence helps maintain board control. The deck also includes some utility lands like Boseiju, Who Endures and Branchloft Pathway, along with powerful creatures like Tyvar, the Pummeler and Ouroboroid. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a mix of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells."
