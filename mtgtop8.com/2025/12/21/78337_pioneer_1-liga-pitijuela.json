The deck also includes powerful finishers like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker to secure victories. With a mix of efficient removal, hand disruption, and resilient threats, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly before they can stabilize or mount a counterattack. The combination of aggression and disruption makes it a formidable force in the Pioneer 1 vs 1 format."
