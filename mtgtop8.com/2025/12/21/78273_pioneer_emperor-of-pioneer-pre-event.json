The deck includes a variety of high-impact creatures with varying mana costs, allowing for flexibility in the Enigmatic Incarnation search. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion provides additional value through blinking creatures for extra triggers. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the three-color requirements of the deck while also providing access to key lands like Cavern of Souls and various Verge lands for additional mana fixing."
