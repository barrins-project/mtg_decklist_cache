            "notes": "This deck revolves around ramping up mana quickly with cards like Arboreal Grazer and Amulet of Vigor to cast Primeval Titan and other big threats early on. The deck utilizes powerful lands like Urza's Saga and Lotus Field to generate even more mana and search for key combo pieces. The goal is to amass enough resources to pull off a game-winning Scapeshift or Green Sun's Zenith combo, overwhelming the opponent with massive, unstoppable threats. The deck also includes utility lands like Boseiju, Who Endures and Tolaria West to protect key spells and ensure a smooth combo execution."
