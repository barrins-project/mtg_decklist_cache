By combining cards like Cauldron Familiar, Witch's Oven, and Mayhem Devil, the deck aims to generate incremental advantages with each sacrifice. Additionally, cards like Bloodtithe Harvester and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker provide additional sources of advantage and disruption. The deck's aggressive strategy is further supported by removal spells like Fatal Push and Scavenger's Talent to maintain board control and push through damage."
