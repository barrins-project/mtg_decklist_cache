This mana is then used to cast powerful Eldrazi creatures like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Thought-Knot Seer, as well as planeswalkers like Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, the Eye of the Storms. The deck also includes disruption spells like Kozilek's Command and Sowing Mycospawn to control the game and interact with the opponent's strategy. Additionally, Expedition Map is used to tutor for specific lands needed for the combo."
