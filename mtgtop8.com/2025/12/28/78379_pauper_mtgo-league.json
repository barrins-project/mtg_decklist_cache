Once the Spy enters the battlefield, it mills the entire deck, putting cards like Lotleth Giant and Dread Return into the graveyard. This enables a powerful combo finish, using cards like Lotleth Giant to deal massive damage to the opponent or utilizing Dread Return to bring back key creatures for a game-winning turn. The deck aims to efficiently and effectively execute this combo strategy to overwhelm the opponent."
