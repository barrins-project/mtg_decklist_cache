It also aims to stall the game and disrupt the opponent's strategy with counterspells like Negate and Prohibit. The deck also utilizes land destruction with Contaminated Landscape and tempo plays with bounce effects like Snap. Overall, the key strategy is to grind out incremental advantages and overwhelm the opponent with card advantage."

The deck aims to use Faeries for early aggression and control, while also utilizing card draw and recursion effects to maintain card advantage. By combining efficient removal spells like Snuff Out and Cast Down with countermagic like Counterspell, the deck can answer threats effectively. The inclusion of card draw spells like Preordain and Brainstorm allows for consistency and flexibility in gameplay, ensuring the deck can adapt to different situations."
