By playing powerful cards like Gene Pollinator and Ouroboroid, the deck aims to maintain board presence and apply pressure early on. The inclusion of cards like Quantum Riddler and Into the Flood Maw help to disrupt the opponent's strategy while controlling the tempo of the game. The deck also takes advantage of powerful Planeswalker cards like Tyvar, the Pummeler and Sab-Sunen, Luxa Embodied to finish off the opponent quickly and efficiently."
