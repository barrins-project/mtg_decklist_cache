The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain board control with cards like Field of Ruin, Cleansing Wildfire, and Wrath of the Skies. Additionally, the deck includes powerful creatures such as White Orchid Phantom and Magmatic Hellkite to apply pressure and close out the game. Finally, cards like Solitude and Price of Freedom provide additional protection and utility to outmaneuver opponents."
