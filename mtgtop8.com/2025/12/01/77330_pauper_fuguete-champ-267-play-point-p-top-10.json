The deck includes low-cost creatures like Clockwork Percussionist and Goblin Bushwhacker, along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast to clear the way for attacking creatures. The goal is to apply pressure early and often, utilizing a combination of fast creatures and direct damage to defeat the opponent before they can stabilize."
