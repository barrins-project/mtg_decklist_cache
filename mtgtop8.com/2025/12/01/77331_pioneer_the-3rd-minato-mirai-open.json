            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of small, aggressive creatures (aggro) that are low-cost and efficient (Weenie White). The deck focuses on quickly building a board presence with cards like Adeline, Resplendent Cathar, Thalia's Lieutenant, and Coppercoat Vanguard, while also providing some protection with cards like Dauntless Bodyguard and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben. The inclusion of cards like Cavern of Souls and Mutavault provide additional versatility and protection, allowing for aggressive plays while maintaining some board control."
