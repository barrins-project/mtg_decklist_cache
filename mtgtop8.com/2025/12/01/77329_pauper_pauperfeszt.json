The key strategy revolves around using efficient threats like Krark-Clan Shaman and Gixian Infiltrator to apply early pressure, while also controlling the board with removal like Cast Down and Fanatical Offering. Additionally, card advantage is gained through cards like Ichor Wellspring and Writhing Chrysalis, allowing you to outvalue your opponent over the course of the game. The deck aims to maintain a steady stream of threats while disrupting your opponent's game plan, ultimately securing victory through a combination of aggression and control."
