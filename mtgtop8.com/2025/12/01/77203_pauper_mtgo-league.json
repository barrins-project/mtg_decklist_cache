It utilizes control elements like counterspells and removal spells to survive against aggressive strategies, while also including card draw and recursion to maintain card advantage and resilience against removal. The deck can stall the game with defensive creatures like Mulldrifter and Stonehorn Dignitary until it can establish a dominant board position with big threats like Mnemonic Wall and Murmuring Mystic. The goal is to outvalue the opponent and win through overwhelming card advantage and mana advantage."
