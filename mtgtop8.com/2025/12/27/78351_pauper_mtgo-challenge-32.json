Creatures like Kessig Flamebreather and Voldaren Epicure are included to provide additional damage sources. The deck also utilizes cards like Faithless Looting and Lava Dart for card advantage and flexibility. Highway Robbery and Grab the Prize help to maintain pressure on the opponent. Guttersnipe serves as a secondary win condition by dealing damage whenever a non-creature spell is cast."
