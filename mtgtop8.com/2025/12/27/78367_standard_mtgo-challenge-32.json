            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing a mix of powerful creatures and removal spells to establish board presence and overwhelm the opponent quickly. By combining aggressive creatures like Beifong's Bounty Hunters and Bloodghast with cards like Maelstrom Pulse and Restless Cottage for removal, the deck aims to wear down the opponent's defenses and push for victory. The inclusion of cards like Umbral Collar Zealot and Nature's Rhythm also helps to add extra damage and disrupt the opponent's strategy, making it difficult for them to recover. The deck thrives on maintaining constant pressure and leveraging strong synergy between its cards."
