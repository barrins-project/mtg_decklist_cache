Cards like Faithless Looting help dig for more threats, while Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery provide additional card advantage. Lifegain from Vampire's Kiss and Alms of the Vein help to offset the aggressive strategy. The deck also includes some land destruction with Bojuka Bog and bounce lands like Rakdos Carnarium for additional value."
