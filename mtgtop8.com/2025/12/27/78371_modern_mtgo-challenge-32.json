The goal is to establish a powerful board presence early on and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The deck includes powerful threats like Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, along with Eldrazi creatures like Emrakul, the Promised End. The deck aims to control the board with counterspells, removal, and artifacts while ramping into powerful threats to close out the game. The inclusion of cards like Echoes of Eternity and Mind Stone allows for card advantage and flexibility in gameplay."
