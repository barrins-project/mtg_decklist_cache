By utilizing low-cost creatures like Goblin Bushwhacker and Clockwork Percussionist, along with efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, this deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent from the start of the game. The inclusion of cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Rally at the Hornburg allows for explosive plays and ensures a fast-paced, proactive playstyle. Ultimately, the goal is to win the game through relentless aggression and efficient removal."
