The key strategy involves using faeries to disrupt the opponent's game plan and generate card advantage through synergy and tempo plays. The inclusion of Counterspells and removal spells ensures that key threats are dealt with effectively, while the addition of Ninja of the Deep Hours provides additional card draw and pressure. By efficiently using resources and leveraging the faerie tribe's abilities, this deck aims to outpace and outvalue the opponent in order to secure victory."
