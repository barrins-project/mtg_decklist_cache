The deck utilizes inexpensive counterspells like Counterspell and Spell Pierce to protect its threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Drawing cards with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Deep Analysis helps ensure a steady stream of threats and answers. The inclusion of disruptive spells like Sleep of the Dead and Tolarian Terror adds further pressure on the opponent while maintaining card advantage. Ultimately, the goal is to out-tempo and overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and disruptive spells."
