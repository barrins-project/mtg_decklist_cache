By utilizing cards like Myr Enforcers and Refurbished Familiars along with spells like Galvanic Blast and Krark-Clan Shaman, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Thoughtcast and Ichor Wellspring allow for card draw to keep the momentum going. The deck also features a few utility spells like Nihil Spellbomb and Hunter's Blowgun to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
