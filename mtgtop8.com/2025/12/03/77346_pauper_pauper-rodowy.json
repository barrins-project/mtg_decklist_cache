            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle, utilizing the affinity mechanic to quickly deploy artifacts and reduce their costs. By efficiently casting threats like Myr Enforcer and Krark-Clan Shaman, alongside support cards like Galvanic Blast and Thoughtcast, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain an advantage throughout the game. Additional cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Refurbished Familiar help control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy, while also providing card advantage to stay ahead in the resource game."
