Utilizing cards like Bushwhack and Stormchaser's Talent to pump up your creatures and deal extra damage, while also having utility spells like Boomerang Basics and Stock Up to control the board. The deck aims to quickly build a board presence and apply pressure on the opponent, while also having some resilience with cards like Enduring Vitality. The mana base of the deck ensures a smooth and consistent mana curve for aggressive plays."
