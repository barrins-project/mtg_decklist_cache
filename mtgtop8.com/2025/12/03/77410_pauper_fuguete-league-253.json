By combining efficient creatures with powerful auras like Ethereal Armor and Sentinel's Eyes, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and deal damage to the opponent before they can establish their own game plan. The inclusion of cards like Emerge Unscathed and Benevolent Blessing provide additional protection and evasion to ensure the creatures can keep attacking effectively."
