This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence and high damage output, using cards like Avenging Hunter and Malevolent Rumble to deal direct damage and clear the way for attacks. With a mix of creature removal, ramp spells, and aggressive creatures, this Gruul Aggro deck aims to win the game quickly and decisively."
