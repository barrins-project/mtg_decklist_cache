The creatures are low-cost and can put pressure on the opponent early in the game. The burn spells provide reach and can finish off the opponent or deal with threats on the board. The deck aims to outpace the opponent's defenses and win the game before they can stabilize. The mana base is focused on quickly casting spells and maximizing damage output."
