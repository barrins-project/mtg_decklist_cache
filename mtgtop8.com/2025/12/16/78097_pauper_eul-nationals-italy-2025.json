The deck focuses on efficient creatures like Novice Inspector and Thraben Inspector, along with token generators like Battle Screech. Guardians' Pledge and Ramosian Rally can provide a sudden boost in power, while Prismatic Strands can protect the weenies from removal. Overall, this deck aims to quickly build a board presence and apply pressure on the opponent to win the game."
