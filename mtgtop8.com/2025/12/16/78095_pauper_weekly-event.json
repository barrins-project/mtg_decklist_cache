The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of low-cost creatures, while using combat tricks and token generation spells to maintain board control. The deck also includes some equipment and combat tricks to enhance the power of the creatures. Overall, the goal is to apply constant pressure on the opponent and win through efficient creature combat and token generation."
