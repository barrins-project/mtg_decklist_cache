The key strategy involves efficiently dealing with threats and applying pressure early in the game with a mix of creatures and burn spells. The deck also includes life gain options to help stabilize against aggressive opponents. With a strong mana base and a mix of aggressive threats, removal, and burn spells, this deck aims to close out games quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
