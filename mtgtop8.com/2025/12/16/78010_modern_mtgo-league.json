It includes a mix of low-cost creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Guide of Souls, backed up by burn spells like Galvanic Discharge and Goblin Bombardment to clear the way for attacks. Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Seasoned Pyromancer provide additional creature support and card advantage. Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury offers a big threat, while Thraben Charm and Shocking Sharpshooter add versatility. Blood Moon disrupts opponent's mana bases, and Voice of Victory helps push through damage."

The deck also looks to generate massive amounts of mana with Cabal Coffers and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth to fuel powerful spells like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Necrodominance. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through attrition and resource advantage."
