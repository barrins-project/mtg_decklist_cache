It also includes cards that provide card advantage like Thoughtcast and Reckoner's Bargain. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of quick creatures and direct damage spells. Additionally, cards like Metallic Rebuke and Cast Down help with removal and disruption. The inclusion of utility cards like Lembas and Nihil Spellbomb provides additional options for control and resource management."
