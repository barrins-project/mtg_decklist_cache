The key strategy is to keep the board clear of threats and slowly wear down the opponent's resources, while also building up your own resources with cards like Ichor Wellspring and Lembas. The deck also includes some graveyard hate with Nihil Spellbomb and Bojuka Bog to disrupt opponent's graveyard strategies. The win condition is to outvalue the opponent by using efficient removal and card advantage, while also having some beatdown potential with creatures like Cauldron Familiar and Troll of Khazad-dûm."
