The deck also focuses on generating value through cards like Simulacrum Synthesizer and Cryogen Relic. The inclusion of cards like Split Up and United Battlefront allows for additional control over the game. The mana base is built to ensure consistent access to white mana sources, while also providing a small splash of blue with an Island and Fabled Passage. Overall, the deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a 1 vs 1 Standard format."

By utilizing cards like Combustion Technique, It'll Quench Ya!, and Abandon Attachments, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while also maintaining card advantage through Accumulate Wisdom and Stock Up. The deck also includes some finisher cards like Roiling Dragonstorm for a win condition. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the board and outmaneuvering the opponent to claim victory."
