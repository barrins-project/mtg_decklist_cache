This deck aims to apply pressure early and consistently, using cards like Kitchen Imp, Voldaren Epicure, and Sneaky Snacker to chip away at the opponent's life total. Lightning Bolt, Fiery Temper, and Galvanic Blast provide additional reach and removal, while Faithless Looting helps dig for key cards. Alms of the Vein and Vampire's Kiss provide life gain to stabilize against aggressive decks, while Grab the Prize can help disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also features a mana base that supports its aggressive game plan."
