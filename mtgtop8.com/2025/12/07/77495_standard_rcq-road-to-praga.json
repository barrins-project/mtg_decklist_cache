By utilizing cards like Shoot the Sheriff and Phantom Interference to control the board, along with powerful creatures like Kaito, Bane of Nightmares and Preacher of the Schism, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total. The inclusion of cards like Nowhere to Run and Intimidation Tactics further adds to the aggressive strategy, making it difficult for the opponent to mount a defense. The deck also features a mix of land cards to ensure consistent mana production for its spells and creatures."
