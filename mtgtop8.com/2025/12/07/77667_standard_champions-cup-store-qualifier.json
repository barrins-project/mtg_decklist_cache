The deck utilizes a combination of direct damage spells, card draw, and versatile creatures to control the pace of the game and overwhelm the opponent.

Additionally, the deck includes some control elements with cards like Roaring Furnace and Winternight Stories to disrupt the opponent's strategy and secure victory."
