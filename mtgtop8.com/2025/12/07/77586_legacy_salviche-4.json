Ultimately, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent with fast and powerful artifact-based threats."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly establish a board presence by playing efficient creatures like Delver of Secrets and Dragon's Rage Channeler, while disrupting opponents with cards like Daze and Force of Will. The deck also aims to generate card advantage with Brainstorm, Mishra's Bauble, and Ponder, while being able to control the board with Lightning Bolt and Wasteland. Murktide Regent provides a powerful finisher, and the mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility. Overall, this deck focuses on fast tempo plays and aggressive strategies to overwhelm opponents."
