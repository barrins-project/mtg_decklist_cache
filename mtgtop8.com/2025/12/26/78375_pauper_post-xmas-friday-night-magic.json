The key strategy is to play efficient threats like Rhino Beetles and Nyxborn Hydra, while using spells like Cast Down and Terminate to deal with opposing threats. The deck also utilizes card draw and recursion to maintain resources and stay ahead in card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to deploy threats early and disrupt the opponent's game plan, making it difficult for them to catch up and ultimately secure a victory through overwhelming board presence."
