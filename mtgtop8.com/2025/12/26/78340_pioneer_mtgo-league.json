It also utilizes cards like Stock Up and Wishclaw Talisman to dig for combo pieces and maintain card advantage. The Wandering Minstrel and Lumra, Bellow of the Woods provide additional support and card advantage, while cards like Arboreal Grazer and Badgermole Cub help with early board presence. The main goal is to set up an explosive combo using Lotus Field to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."
