Arcbound Ravager and Ornithopter provide additional synergy to overwhelm the opponent, while cards like Weapons Manufacturing and Urza's Saga help to pump up creatures and create more threats. Engineered Explosives and Tormod's Crypt provide disruption against opposing strategies, while cards like Sink into Stupor and Thoughtcast offer card advantage and control options. The deck aims to be fast, efficient, and relentless in its aggro strategy."

The deck focuses on using cards like Faithless Looting and Thought Scour to fill the graveyard, while also disrupting the opponent's hand with cards like Thoughtseize. Once key creatures like Archon of Cruelty and Emperor of Bones are in the graveyard, the deck aims to bring them back to the battlefield to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures."
