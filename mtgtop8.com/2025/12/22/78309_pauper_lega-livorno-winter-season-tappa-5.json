The key strategy is to maintain a fast and consistent pace of aggression, utilizing cards like Goblin Tomb Raider and Kessig Flamebreather to pressure the opponent early on. Support cards like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt help to finish off opponents quickly, while cards like Thermo-Alchemist and Experimental Synthesizer provide additional reach and damage potential. With a low mana curve and a focus on proactive play, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents before they can establish their own game plan."
