The deck uses God-Pharaoh's Faithful and Sunscape Familiar to gain incremental advantages, while cards like Snap and Prohibit provide disruption. Mulldrifter and Archaeomancer provide card advantage and recursion, allowing the player to out-value their opponent. Meeting of Minds and Lórien Revealed offer additional card draw and filtering. The deck aims to outlast opponents, gradually gaining advantage and overwhelming them with a superior late game."
