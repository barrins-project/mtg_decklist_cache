With a mix of land destruction spells like Stone Rain and mana ramp, Gruul Aggro aims to disrupt your opponent's mana base while building up your own board presence. Writhing Chrysalis can also be used to create threats while Eldrazi Repurposer can deal with troublesome artifacts. Overall, the deck is all about fast mana acceleration and aggressive creature plays."
