By utilizing cards like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent, the deck can quickly apply pressure while countering opponent's plays with spells like Counterspell. The deck is also focused on card advantage through cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder, while also utilizing graveyard interaction with cards like Thought Scour and Tolarian Terror. With a focus on tempo and disruption, the deck looks to quickly close out games while controlling the pace of the match."
