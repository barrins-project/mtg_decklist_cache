By cycling through cards quickly with Thoughtcast and Ichor Wellspring, the deck can deploy threats like Myr Enforcer and Gearseeker Serpent early and often. The deck also includes burn spells like Galvanic Blast to remove blockers or finish off opponents. Nihil Spellbomb provides both graveyard hate and card draw, while Refurbished Familiar and Reckoner's Bargain offer additional utility and synergy with the artifact theme. The goal is to quickly build a board presence and apply consistent pressure to win the game."
