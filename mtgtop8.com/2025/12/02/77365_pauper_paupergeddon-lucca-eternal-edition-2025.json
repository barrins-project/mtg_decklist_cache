The deck aims to outlast the opponent by maintaining board presence and resource advantage, ultimately overwhelming them with powerful threats and versatile removal options. The synergy between the Urzatron lands and artifact cards allows for a highly adaptable and strategic playstyle, making it a formidable control archetype in the Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
