The deck also includes card draw and recursion with Ichor Wellspring and Refurbished Familiar. Additionally, the inclusion of Writhing Chrysalis and Nyxborn Hydra allows for a potential late-game payoff with big creatures. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with aggressive plays and resource management."
