This allows for explosive plays with Primeval Titan fetching key lands like Vesuva and Tolaria West to find the combo pieces. With access to cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Scapeshift, the deck can quickly find the pieces it needs to win the game. The inclusion of Urza's Saga adds consistency to finding key artifacts like Amulet of Vigor. The deck also includes a toolbox of utility lands to provide versatility in different matchups."

Cards like Ajani, Nacatl Pariah, Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer, and Guide of Souls provide early-game pressure, while cards like Goblin Bombardment and Galvanic Discharge offer reach and removal. With cards like Seasoned Pyromancer and Voice of Victory providing additional value, the deck aims to close out games quickly through a combination of creature aggression and direct damage. The mana base is optimized for consistency and efficiency to support the deck's aggressive game plan."
