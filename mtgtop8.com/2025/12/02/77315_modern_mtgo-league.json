The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly with a combination of creature aggression and direct damage spells like Galvanic Discharge and Goblin Bombardment. Arena of Glory helps to pump up the team, while Voice of Victory provides additional value. The inclusion of disruptive cards like Thraben Charm and Blood Moon adds versatility and disruption to the deck's game plan."
