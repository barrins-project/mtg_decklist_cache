The deck focuses on using cards like Pentad Prism and Lotus Petal to ramp up mana production, while also drawing cards with Deep Analysis and Contentious Plan to find combo pieces. Once enough poison counters are accumulated, the deck can use spells like Prologue to Phyresis and Infectious Inquiry to finish off the opponent with a Poison Storm."
