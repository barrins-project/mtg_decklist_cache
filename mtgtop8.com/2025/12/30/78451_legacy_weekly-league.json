This is achieved through a combination of counterspells like Force of Will, removal spells like Swords to Plowshares, card draw/filtering with Brainstorm and Ponder, and powerful planeswalkers like Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win conditions for a decisive victory."
