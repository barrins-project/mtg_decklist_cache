            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly building a board presence with low-cost creatures and efficient removal spells. The key strategy is to continuously bounce and return creatures to hand with cards like Kor Skyfisher and Glint Hawk, in order to trigger valuable enter-the-battlefield effects and maintain tempo. With a mix of card draw, removal, and recursion, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a relentless stream of threats and disruption. The mana base also supports the deck's aggressive game plan by including artifact lands for additional synergy and flexibility."
