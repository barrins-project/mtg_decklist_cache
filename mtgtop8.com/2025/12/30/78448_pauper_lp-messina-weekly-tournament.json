Malevolent Rumble and Ram Through provide removal options to clear the way for our creatures to attack, while Jewel Thief can provide card advantage to keep up the pressure. With a focus on speed and aggression, this mono green aggro deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent can establish their own board presence."
