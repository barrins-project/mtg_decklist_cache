Alms of the Vein and Vampire's Kiss can drain the opponent's life total, adding to the aggro strategy. Faithless Looting helps with card selection and filling the graveyard for Fiery Temper's madness cost. Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery offer additional reach and disruption. The mana base includes dual lands for consistency."

By utilizing cards that provide extra mana and haste to creatures, as well as efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, the deck can apply pressure early on. The deck aims to swarm the opponent with creatures, backed up by direct damage spells to finish off the opponent quickly before they have a chance to stabilize. It utilizes a low mana curve and high card velocity to maintain momentum and push for a quick victory."
