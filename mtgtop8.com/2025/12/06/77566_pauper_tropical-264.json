The deck also includes some graveyard interaction with cards like Faithless Looting and Alms of the Vein to provide additional value. By combining creatures that can attack early and direct damage spells, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize or mount a defense. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Grab the Prize allows for additional flexibility in the deck's strategy."
