The deck aims to efficiently use card draw and selection to fuel the graveyard and utilize delve creatures like Cryptic Serpent. Murmuring Mystic provides additional threats while Sleep of the Dead can lock down the opponent's board. Overall, this Mono Blue Terror deck seeks to outmaneuver and outlast the opponent through careful resource management and strategic decision-making."
