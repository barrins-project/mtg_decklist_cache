The goal is to cheat big creatures like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Atraxa, Grand Unifier into play using Show and Tell or Stock Up, and then use Omniscience to cast additional spells for free. The deck also has access to a tutoring package with cards like Cunning Wish and Intuition to find key combo pieces. Additionally, the deck has card draw and filtering with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student."
