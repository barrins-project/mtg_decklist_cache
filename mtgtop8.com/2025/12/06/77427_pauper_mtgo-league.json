The deck also includes spells like Malevolent Rumble and Wild Growth to support the aggro strategy and ensure consistent mana production. By constantly applying pressure and maintaining board presence, this deck aims to outpace and outmuscle the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize and counterattack."

It aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly with a mix of efficient creatures, burn spells, and card draw, while also disrupting their graveyard strategies with Nihil Spellbomb. The deck's synergy and efficiency in utilizing artifacts allow it to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out games before they can establish their own board presence."
