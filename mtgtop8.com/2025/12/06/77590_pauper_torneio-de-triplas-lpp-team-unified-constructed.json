Once you have enough creatures in the graveyard, you can use Dread Return to bring back a powerful creature like Lotleth Giant and win the game in one turn. The deck also includes mana ramp cards like Overgrown Battlement and Saruli Caretaker to help you cast your spells quickly. Additionally, cards like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help you dig through your deck to find the pieces you need for your combo."
