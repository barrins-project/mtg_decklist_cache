With a mix of discard spells like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach, along with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze, the deck aims to keep the opponent off balance. At the same time, threats like Barrowgoyf, Murktide Regent, and Kaito, Bane of Nightmares provide a clock for the opponent to deal with. Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student helps to filter draws and generate card advantage. This deck combines disruption and aggression to control the pace of the game."
