The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to colored mana sources, while also incorporating utility lands like Karakas and Cavern of Souls to protect key creatures and ensure successful spell resolution."

The deck also incorporates disruption elements like Chalice of the Void and Force of Will to control the game and protect key combo pieces. By efficiently ramping up mana and assembling powerful combo plays, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
