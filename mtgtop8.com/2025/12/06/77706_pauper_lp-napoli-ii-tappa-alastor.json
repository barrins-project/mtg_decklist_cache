By sacrificing artifacts like Ichor Wellspring and Refurbished Familiar with cards such as Fanatical Offering and Eviscerator's Insight, the deck can generate value while controlling the board. Additionally, the deck contains removal spells like Cast Down and Krark-Clan Shaman to clear the way for aggressive creatures like Nyxborn Hydra. With a mix of utility lands like Bojuka Bog and Vault of Whispers, as well as mana fixing with Twisted Landscape, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while applying steady pressure."
