The deck also utilizes cards like Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury and Ajani, Nacatl Pariah to create a powerful board presence. The inclusion of cards like Goblin Bombardment and Voice of Victory provide additional ways to push damage through and secure the win. The deck aims to close out games quickly and efficiently through a combination of creature aggression and burn spells."
