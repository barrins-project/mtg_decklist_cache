Additionally, cards like Firebending Lesson and Boomerang Basics provide additional removal options, while Accumulate Wisdom and Monument to Endurance help you draw more cards and stay ahead in resources. Ultimately, the goal is to control the game until you can secure a win condition."

This is achieved through a combination of self-mill effects, reanimation spells, and payoff cards that benefit from having creatures in the graveyard. The deck aims to set up explosive turns where multiple threats are cast from the graveyard in quick succession, putting the opponent on the back foot and securing victory through overwhelming board presence."
