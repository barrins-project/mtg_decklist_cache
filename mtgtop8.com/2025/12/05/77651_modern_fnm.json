The deck aims to establish board presence quickly with cards like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Seasoned Pyromancer, while also disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Goblin Bombardment and Ajani, Nacatl Pariah. The inclusion of cards like Blood Moon and Static Prison helps to shut down opposing strategies, while cards like Voice of Victory provide additional reach and finishers. Overall, the deck focuses on fast, aggressive plays to secure victory."
