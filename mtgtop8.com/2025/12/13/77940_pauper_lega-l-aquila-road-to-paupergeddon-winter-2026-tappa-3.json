The deck also includes card draw and deck manipulation options like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Thought Scour to maintain card advantage. Sleep of the Dead can provide a potential game-ending finishing move, while Tolarian Terror adds extra aggression. Lórien Revealed can provide additional card advantage and tempo advantage to keep the pressure on the opponent."
