It utilizes efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage, along with burn spells like Burst Lightning and Reckless Rage, to clear the way for direct attacks to the opponent's life total. The mana base also supports this strategy by providing consistent access to the necessary colors of mana."
