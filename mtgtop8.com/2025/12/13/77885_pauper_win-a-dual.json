By using a combination of efficient creatures and removal spells, along with graveyard hate and sacrificing effects, the deck aims to control the board and apply constant pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of artifact lands and artifact synergy cards provide additional value and versatility to the deck's strategy, allowing for various lines of play and ways to outmaneuver the opponent."
