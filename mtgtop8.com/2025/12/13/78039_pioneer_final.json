The deck also focuses on creating synergy with cards like Experimental Synthesizer and Cori-Steel Cutter to deal massive damage. By running a mix of burn spells like Reckless Rage and Monstrous Rage, along with card draw and buffs, the deck aims to maintain pressure and tempo throughout the game. The mana base is optimized for consistent casting of spells and creatures to maintain aggression."
