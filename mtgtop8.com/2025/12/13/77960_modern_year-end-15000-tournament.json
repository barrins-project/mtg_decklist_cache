Karn, the Great Creator can shut down artifact-based strategies, and Ugin, the Eye of the Storms can clear the board. Overall, this deck aims to establish dominance on the battlefield and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful threats and control elements."

Spells like Kozilek's Command and Malevolent Rumble provide additional control options, while cards like Writhing Chrysalis and Sowing Mycospawn can generate additional threats. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm and outmaneuver the opponent through a combination of ramp and control elements."
