The deck also includes cards to prevent graveyard recursion and search for specific answers with cards like Consult the Star Charts and Wan Shi Tong, Librarian. The mana base is designed to support the control strategy and provide flexibility in casting spells."

It utilizes cards like Stormchaser's Talent and Torch the Tower to target the opponent directly, while also using creatures like Badgermole Cub and Thundertrap Trainer to apply pressure on the board. The inclusion of Ral, Crackling Wit provides additional card advantage and potential burn damage. The mana base is optimized for casting spells and creatures efficiently, allowing the deck to maintain a fast pace throughout the game."
