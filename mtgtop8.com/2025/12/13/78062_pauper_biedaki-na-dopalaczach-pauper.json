By constantly putting pressure on the opponent with aggressive creatures like Goblin Bushwhacker and Voldaren Epicure, while also dealing direct damage with burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt, this deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. Additionally, cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Clockwork Percussionist allow for explosive starts and generating additional value. The inclusion of cards like Rally at the Hornburg and Wrenn's Resolve help to maintain tempo and ensure a relentless assault on the opponent's life total."
