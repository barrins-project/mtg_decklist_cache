This deck utilizes artifacts such as Myr Retriever, Pactdoll Terror, and Golem Foundry to create threats and support the land strategy. The deck also includes cards like Candy Trail and Eviscerator's Insight for card advantage and removal. Overall, the goal is to establish control of the game through mana generation and strategic card plays."
