The deck also has card draw and graveyard interaction, such as Thought Scour and Gurmag Angler, to maintain card advantage and apply pressure. Overall, the strategy revolves around slowing down the opponent's game plan while staying resilient and efficient in resource management."

The inclusion of disruptive spells and bounce effects helps to control the board state and protect the deck's creatures. With a low mana curve and a focus on maximizing efficiency, this Mono Blue Aggro deck aims to quickly close out games by pressuring the opponent and disrupting their game plan."
