It includes support cards such as Goblin Welder and Goblin Engineer to control the board and find combo pieces efficiently. The deck also has disruption cards like Red Elemental Blast and Pyroblast to protect the combo and disrupt opponent's strategy. Overall, the key strategy is to assemble the combo pieces quickly and efficiently while controlling the board with disruptive cards to win the game in a fast and consistent manner."
