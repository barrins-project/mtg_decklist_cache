The deck aims to efficiently use low-cost spells like Brainstorm, Counterspell, and Force Spike to control the game while maintaining a board presence with creatures like Cryptic Serpent and Delver of Secrets. By consistently drawing cards through spells like Thought Scour and Deep Analysis, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory."
