It also disrupts the opponent's game plan with cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Collector Ouphe. The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Wasteland, while setting up powerful plays with Gaea's Cradle and Scryb Ranger. Overall, the deck combines aggressive creatures with disruption and mana acceleration to overpower the opponent."
