The deck aims to control the board with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push, as well as have ways to protect its creatures and re-use their enter-the-battlefield effects with cards like Ephemerate and Flickerwisp. The deck also includes enchantment-based synergies with cards like Witch Enchanter and Quantum Riddler. By utilizing a mix of disruptive elements and aggressive threats, the deck seeks to outmaneuver the opponent and secure a victory."
