It relies heavily on efficient creatures like Guttersnipe and Voldaren Epicure to chip away at the opponent's life total, while also utilizing burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast to finish them off. Faithless Looting helps with card selection and Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery provide additional resources and a potential finisher. Overall, the goal is to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
