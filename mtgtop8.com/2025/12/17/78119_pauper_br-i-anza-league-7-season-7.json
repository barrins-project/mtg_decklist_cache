By maintaining a high tempo through cards like Delver of Secrets and Tolarian Terror, the deck aims to pressure the opponent while also disrupting their game plan with counterspells and card draw. The inclusion of cards like Thought Scour and Deep Analysis helps to enable the graveyard interaction of Cryptic Serpent and Lórien Revealed. Ultimately, the deck seeks to establish early board presence and control the game until victory."
