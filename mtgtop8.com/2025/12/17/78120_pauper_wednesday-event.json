The deck aims to generate value through sacrificing creatures and artifacts, while also using land destruction and card draw to maintain advantage. The Jund color combination allows for a versatile and disruptive playstyle that can overwhelm opponents with a combination of aggression and resource denial. By constantly pressuring the opponent and manipulating the game state, this deck aims to secure victory through attrition and outmaneuvering the opponent."

By ramping up mana with Arbor Elf, Utopia Sprawl, and Wild Growth, the deck can quickly cast powerful threats like Avenging Hunter and Nyxborn Hydra. Ram Through and Malevolent Rumble provide removal options, allowing the deck to push through damage and disrupt opponents. The key strategy is to build a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure throughout the game, utilizing efficient creatures and enchantments to overpower the opponent."
