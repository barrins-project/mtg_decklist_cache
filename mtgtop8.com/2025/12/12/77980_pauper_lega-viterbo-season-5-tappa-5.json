By combining efficient creatures like Gixian Infiltrator with ways to generate card advantage and disruption like Ichor Wellspring and Nihil Spellbomb, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with constant pressure. The inclusion of removal spells like Cast Down and Cleansing Wildfire helps keep the board clear for your creatures to attack. Additionally, the deck has some graveyard recursion and sacrifice synergies to provide extra value and resilience in longer games."
