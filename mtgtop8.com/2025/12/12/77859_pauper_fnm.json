The combo includes using cards like Lotleth Giant and Oliphaunt to deal massive damage to the opponent once they are reanimated. Gnaw to the Bone is used to gain life and protect against aggressive decks, while Malevolent Rumble and Molten Gatekeeper provide additional removal and control options. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to quickly and efficiently reanimate powerful creatures to overwhelm the opponent."

Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to draw more creatures and maintain a strong presence on the battlefield. Timberwatch Elf and Avenging Hunter provide strong finishers, while Wellwisher helps to stabilize against aggro decks. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient creature-based strategy, utilizing the synergy between the different Elf cards to create a powerful aggro deck."
