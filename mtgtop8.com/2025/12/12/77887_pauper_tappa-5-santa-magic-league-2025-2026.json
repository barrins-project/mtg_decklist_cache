Once the graveyard is full, the deck aims to combo off with Dread Return to bring back powerful creatures like Lotleth Giant to deal massive damage to the opponent. The key strategy is to efficiently ramp up mana using cards like Overgrown Battlement and Saruli Caretaker while also utilizing creatures like Gatecreeper Vine and Masked Vandal for additional value. The deck has a strong synergy between its creatures and spells to create a powerful combo engine."
