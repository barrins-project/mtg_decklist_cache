The strategy is to play fast creatures like Emberheart Challenger and Monastery Swiftspear early on, while using burst damage spells like Burst Lightning and Monstrous Rage to take control of the board. The goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can stabilize. The deck also includes cards like Witchstalker Frenzy and Magebane Lizard to provide additional damage and disruption. The mana base is streamlined with mostly Mountains and a few utility lands like Rockface Village and Soulstone Sanctuary."

Spells like Monstrous Rage and Burst Lightning provide additional reach and removal, while cards like Opt and Sleight of Hand help to maintain card advantage and find the necessary pieces. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creatures and burn spells, while also having some control elements with counterspells like Spell Pierce. The mana base allows for consistent early game aggression while also providing the necessary colors for the spells."
