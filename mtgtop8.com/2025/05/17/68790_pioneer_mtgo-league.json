            "notes": "The main concept of this Red Deck Wins aggro deck is to quickly deploy low-cost creatures and burn spells to apply pressure on the opponent and deal damage as fast as possible. The deck focuses on using efficient burn spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike, along with powerful creatures like Bonecrusher Giant and Sunspine Lynx. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent early in the game and close out the match before they have a chance to stabilize. The addition of cards like Tersa Lightshatter and Monstrous Rage provide additional ways to push through damage and secure victories."
