Once Omniscience is in play, the goal is to cast a Roiling Dragonstorm and generate a large number of dragon tokens to overwhelm the opponent. Cards like Temporary Lockdown and Confounding Riddle help control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Founding the Third Path can provide additional value by searching for key combo pieces."

            "notes": "The primary focus of this deck is to quickly deploy low-cost creatures and cast spells to deal damage to the opponent's face as fast as possible. Utilizing cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Stormchaser's Talent, along with cheap spells like Opt and Sleight of Hand, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Drake Hatcher and Cori-Steel Cutter provide additional threats and potential for explosive damage output. This deck prioritizes speed and aggression to secure victories."
