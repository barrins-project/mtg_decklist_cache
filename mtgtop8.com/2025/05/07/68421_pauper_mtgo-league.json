Writhing Chrysalis and Malevolent Rumble provide removal options, while Jewel Thief can disrupt the opponent's strategies. Bannerhide Krushok and Eldrazi Repurposer offer additional threats that can be difficult for opponents to deal with. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain a strong board presence to secure a rapid victory."
