            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly getting Arclight Phoenix into the graveyard and then bringing it back to the battlefield for repeated damage. It utilizes a combination of cards like Opt, Treasure Cruise, and Sleight of Hand to cycle through the deck quickly and find the necessary pieces. Picklock Prankster and Cori-Steel Cutter help to enable the Phoenix's revival, while Fiery Impulse and Lightning Axe provide removal options. The deck also includes some counter spells and additional card draw to maintain consistency and aggression."
