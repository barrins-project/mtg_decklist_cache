It utilizes cards like Fiery Impulse, Lightning Axe, and Picklock Prankster to control the board and make sure Arclight Phoenix can attack. The deck also includes draw spells like Consider, Opt, and Treasure Cruise to cycle through the deck quickly and find the necessary cards. The inclusion of Temporal Trespass and Proft's Eidetic Memory provide additional value and ways to close out the game. The key strategy is to be fast and efficient in casting spells to overwhelm the opponent."

The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value through blinking creatures and enchantments. With a mix of powerful creatures, removal spells, and land fetching abilities, this deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents in a slower, grindy game."

            "notes": "This Red Deck Wins aggro deck focuses on quickly overwhelming opponents with a mix of direct damage spells, aggressive creatures, and mana-efficient threats. With a low mana curve and a focus on attacking early and often, this deck aims to put pressure on opponents and end the game quickly before they can stabilize. Cards like Burst Lightning, Monstrous Rage, and Kumano Faces Kakkazan provide flexible removal and reach, while creatures like Sunspine Lynx and Emberheart Challenger deliver fast, evasive damage. Den of the Bugbear and Manifold Mouse add additional threats and versatility to keep opponents on their toes."
