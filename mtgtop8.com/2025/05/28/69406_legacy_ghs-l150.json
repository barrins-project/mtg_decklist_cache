            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to systematically control and disrupt the opponent's resources while slowly draining their hand and life total. By using cards like The Rack, Smallpox, and Raven's Crime, the deck aims to keep the opponent on the back foot and limit their options. Additionally, cards like Fatal Push and Inquisition of Kozilek serve to further disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, this deck focuses on grinding out advantages over time and ultimately overwhelming the opponent with its resource denial and attrition strategies."
