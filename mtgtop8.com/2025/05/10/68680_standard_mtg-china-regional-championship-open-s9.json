By using cards like Duress and Cut Down to strip the opponent's hand and removal spells like Go for the Throat to deal with threats, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's tempo. The deck also utilizes powerful creatures like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Archfiend of the Dross to apply pressure and close out the game. Overall, the key concept is to control the game and outvalue the opponent."

Enduring Curiosity allows for card draw to maintain momentum, while powerful finishers like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Kaito, Bane of Nightmares can help secure victory in the late game."

The key strategy is to maintain board presence while using removal and counterspells to efficiently deal with threats. Enduring Curiosity helps with card draw, while cards like Cut Down and Go for the Throat provide removal options. Kaito, Bane of Nightmares can be a game-changer against certain matchups. The mana base is optimized for consistency and the inclusion of Soulstone Sanctuary and Restless Reef gives the deck some resilience against aggressive decks."
