This allows the player to chain together a series of powerful spells and eventually win the game through a combo finish. The deck also includes protection and recursion elements to ensure consistency and resilience. By carefully managing resources and maximizing card advantage, the player can effectively execute their game plan and overwhelm the opponent with a sudden burst of spells."
