By utilizing cards like Opt and Dispelling Exhale for card selection, Lightning Helix for creature removal and burn damage, and Stock Up for card draw, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and eventually win through powerful finishers like Shiko, Paragon of the Way and Chandra, Hope's Beacon. The inclusion of spells like Temporary Lockdown and No More Lies also provides additional disruption and control elements to the deck's game plan."
