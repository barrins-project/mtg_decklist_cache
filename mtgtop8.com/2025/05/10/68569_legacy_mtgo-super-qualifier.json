The deck also utilizes cards like Voltaic Key and Manifold Key to untap artifacts for extra value, while Karn, the Great Creator allows for artifact tutoring. The combination of aggressive artifact plays and mana acceleration creates a fast-paced aggro strategy that overwhelms the opponent before they have a chance to respond effectively."

The deck also includes cards like Karn, the Great Creator and All Is Dust to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of cards like Chalice of the Void and Trinisphere help to slow down the opponent while the deck builds towards its powerful late-game threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger."
