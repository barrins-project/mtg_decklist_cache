This mana can then be used to ramp into powerful artifact creatures and spells, such as Myr Retriever and Eviscerator's Insight. The deck also contains various ways to draw cards and gain advantage, as well as ways to sacrifice artifacts for additional benefits. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of card advantage, mana advantage, and powerful threats."
