The inclusion of cards like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Sheoldred's Edict also adds additional control elements to the deck. The overall strategy is to apply pressure early and keep the pressure on until you emerge victorious."

The key strategy is to use efficient creatures like Cheeky House-Mouse and Mabel, Heir to Cragflame along with powerful spells like Monstrous Rage and Burst Lightning to push damage quickly. The inclusion of cards like Sheltered by Ghosts and Shardmage's Rescue also helps protect key creatures and maintain pressure. The mana base is optimized to ensure consistent early game aggression."
