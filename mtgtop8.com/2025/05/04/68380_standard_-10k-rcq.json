By curving out with aggressive creatures like Abhorrent Oculus and Marauding Mako, and using efficient burn spells like Torch the Tower and Glacial Dragonhunt to control the board, it aims to close out the game quickly. The key strategy is to maintain a steady stream of threats while disrupting the opponent's game plan with counter spells like Spell Pierce. The deck also includes card draw and card advantage tools like Profit's Eidetic Memory to maintain momentum."
