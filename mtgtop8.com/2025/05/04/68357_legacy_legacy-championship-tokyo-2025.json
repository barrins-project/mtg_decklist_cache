Utilizing efficient counterspells like Force of Will and Daze, alongside powerful creatures like Murktide Regent and Dragon's Rage Channeler, the deck aims to pressure opponents while disrupting their strategies. The deck also relies on card selection and card advantage engines like Brainstorm and Mishra's Bauble to maintain consistency and outmaneuver opponents. Wasteland and other land disruption cards further help in slowing down opponents while the deck aims to close out the game in a swift manner."
