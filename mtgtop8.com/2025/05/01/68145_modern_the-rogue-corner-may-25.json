The deck focuses on aggressive plays with Aggro creatures like Street Wraith and Webstrike Elite, while also controlling the board with Lightning Bolt and Malevolent Rumble. Wrenn and Six provides additional land recursion and card advantage, while Monument to Endurance helps to pump up your creatures. Additionally, Faithless Looting helps to filter your draws and Commercial District can provide additional mana acceleration. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with constant land destruction and creature pressure."
