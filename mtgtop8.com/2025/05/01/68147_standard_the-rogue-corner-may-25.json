The deck utilizes a variety of artifacts and enchantments to keep the opponent's board in check while also creating card advantage through draw spells and token generation. The deck focuses on out-valuing the opponent and eventually overwhelming them with its powerful late-game threats. The deck's synergy lies in its ability to consistently answer threats while drawing cards to ensure a steady stream of resources throughout the game."
