The deck focuses on controlling the game with counterspells like Counterspell and Spell Pierce while cycling through the deck with Brainstorm, Thought Scour, and Ponder. Deem Inferior and LÃ³rien Revealed provide additional boosts to the creatures on the board. The deck also includes some card advantage with Deep Analysis. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and maintain control throughout the game."
