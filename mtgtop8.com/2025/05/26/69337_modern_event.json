By combining aggressive creatures with cards like Solitude and Prismatic Ending, the deck aims to disrupt opponents' strategies while steadily gaining life to outlast them. The inclusion of Martyr of Sands and Abiding Grace further enhances the life-gain aspect of the deck, giving it resilience against aggressive strategies. The deck also includes some board wipes like Supreme Verdict to deal with wide boards, along with some land disruption with Field of Ruin."
