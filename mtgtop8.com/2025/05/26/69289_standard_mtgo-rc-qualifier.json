The deck aims to control the board early on with cards like Cut Down and Go for the Throat, while also applying pressure with evasive creatures like Azure Beastbinder and Spyglass Siren. Enduring Curiosity and Preacher of the Schism provide card advantage to keep the aggression going, while Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Soulstone Sanctuary offer powerful late-game threats. The deck's versatility and ability to disrupt the opponent's game plan make it a formidable force in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
