By casting multiple spells in a single turn, the player can generate a significant number of poison counters quickly and win the game. The deck includes cards that generate mana, draw cards, create poison counters, and provide protection against opposing spells. The key strategy is to efficiently chain together spells to create a deadly storm of poison that the opponent cannot withstand."
