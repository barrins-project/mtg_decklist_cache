Unstoppable Slasher and Bloodletter of Aclazotz provide early threats, while Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Archfiend of the Dross offer late-game finishes. Liliana of the Veil helps in controlling the board while providing card advantage. The deck aims to outvalue your opponent while setting up a strong board presence to secure the win."
