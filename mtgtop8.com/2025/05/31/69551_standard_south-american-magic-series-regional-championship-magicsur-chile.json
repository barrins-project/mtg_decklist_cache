The deck includes cards to ramp up mana quickly, draw cards, counter opponent's spells, and manipulate the board state. By setting up Omniscience, the player can cast spells for free and take advantage of powerful effects like Roiling Dragonstorm to deal massive damage or Floodfarm Verge to control the opponent's options. The deck aims to create a lockout situation where the opponent is unable to effectively respond to the player's threats."

By combining the powerful abilities of cards like Preacher of the Schism, Spyglass Siren, and Floodpits Drowner with removal spells like Go for the Throat and Cut Down, the deck aims to pressure the opponent early and maintain tempo throughout the game.
