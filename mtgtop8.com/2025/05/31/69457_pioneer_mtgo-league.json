The deck also includes creatures with evasion and powerful abilities like Voice of Victory and Archon of Emeria. The mana base is crafted to support both black and white spells, with utility lands like Mutavault and Bleachbone Verge. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of efficient threats and control elements, aiming to close out games quickly with a strong presence on the battlefield."
