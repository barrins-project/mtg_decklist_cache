The deck aims to apply pressure through efficient creatures like Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd and Orcish Bowmasters, while also providing card advantage with Staff of the Storyteller. Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Overlord of the Balemurk serve as finishers to close out the game. The mana base includes Wasteland and Karakas for disruption, with a mix of fetch lands for consistency."
