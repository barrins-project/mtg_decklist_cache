            "notes": "The deck focuses on fast, aggressive gameplay by utilizing cheap artifacts and creatures to quickly overwhelm the opponent. Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Kappa Cannoneer provide early aggression, while Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student and Thought Monitor offer card advantage and value. Mishra's Bauble and Mox Opal help to ramp into bigger threats, and Portable Hole provides removal. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Metallic Rebuke and Pithing Needle to control the board. Urza's Saga and Spire of Industry provide additional mana sources, allowing for explosive plays and finishing the opponent off quickly."
