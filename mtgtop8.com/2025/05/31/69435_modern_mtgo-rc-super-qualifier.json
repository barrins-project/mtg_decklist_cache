The deck focuses on playing low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Slickshot Show-Off, while also utilizing powerful spells like Lightning Bolt and Mutagenic Growth to deal damage quickly. The deck also includes cards like Dragon's Rage Channeler and Cori-Steel Cutter to provide additional aggression and disruption. By combining efficient creatures with burn spells and card draw, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and close out the game before they can stabilize."
