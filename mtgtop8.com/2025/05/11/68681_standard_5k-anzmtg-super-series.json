The creatures in the deck have abilities that make them difficult to block, allowing you to deal damage consistently. By combining disruption and aggression, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently."

By curving out with aggressive creatures like Abhorrent Oculus and Steamcore Scholar, backed up by disruptive spells like Torch the Tower and Spell Pierce, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm opponents before they can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Fear of Missing Out and Profit's Eidetic Memory provide card advantage and additional reach to close out games. The mana base allows for consistent casting of spells and ensuring the deck can operate smoothly."

Once Omniscience is on the battlefield, the player can then cast multiple spells for free, such as Roiling Dragonstorm, to overwhelm the opponent and win the game. The deck also includes protection spells like Spell Pierce and Temporary Lockdown to ensure the player's combo goes off without interruption. Overall, the strategy revolves around quickly assembling the Omniscience combo and leveraging its power to secure victory."
