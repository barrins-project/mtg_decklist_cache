By combining efficient creature cards like Sunpearl Kirin and Nurturing Pixie with powerful spells like Stormchaser's Talent and No More Lies, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and put pressure on the opponent. Additionally, cards like Grim Bauble and Entity Tracker provide disruption and control options to support the aggressive game plan."
