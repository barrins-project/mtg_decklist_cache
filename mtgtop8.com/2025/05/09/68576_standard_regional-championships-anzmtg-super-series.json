The deck also includes evasive threats like Spyglass Siren and Deep-Cavern Bat to apply pressure on the opponent. Enduring Curiosity and Tishana's Tidebinder provide card advantage and tempo, allowing the deck to maintain its aggressive strategy. The inclusion of Sheoldred, the Apocalypse as a finisher adds a powerful threat that can quickly close out games. The deck aims to outpace the opponent with its aggressive creatures and disruption spells."

            "notes": "The key concept of this Jeskai Aggro deck is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and efficient removal spells to quickly reduce their life total to zero. By using a combination of low-cost creatures like Abhorrent Oculus and Marauding Mako, along with spells like Torch the Tower and Abrade, the deck aims to establish early board presence and pressure the opponent while maintaining control of the game. The inclusion of cards like Guardian of New Benalia and Profit's Eidetic Memory provides additional support and card advantage to keep up the pressure and close out the game swiftly."

By utilizing a mix of defensive tools and mana manipulation, it aims to outlast the opponent and eventually overwhelm them with a combination of threats and resource denial. The deck's strength lies in its ability to adapt to various situations while maintaining a strong defensive posture, ultimately grinding down the opponent's resources until victory is assured."
