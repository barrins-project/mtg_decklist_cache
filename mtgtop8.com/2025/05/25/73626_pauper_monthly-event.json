It also focuses on sacrificing artifacts to trigger various abilities and generate value. The deck aims to control the game through generation of mana and card advantage, while utilizing cards like Pactdoll Terror and Golem Foundry to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent. The synergy between the Urzatron lands and artifact sacrifice mechanics allows for a consistent and powerful control strategy."

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of fast creatures and direct damage spells, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize and turn the game in their favor."
