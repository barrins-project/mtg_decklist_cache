            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to establish control over the game by assembling the Urzatron lands to generate large amounts of mana. This allows the player to consistently cast powerful spells and develop their board presence. Utilizing various artifacts like Expedition Map and Prophetic Prism, along with cards like Golem Foundry and Candy Trail, the deck aims to create a strong late-game advantage. Additionally, the inclusion of Myr Retriever and Pactdoll Terror provides utility and removal options to help maintain control over the game and secure a victory."
