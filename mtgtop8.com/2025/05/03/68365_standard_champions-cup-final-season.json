By utilizing cheap, aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Cori-Steel Cutter, along with efficient burn spells like Burst Lightning and Torch the Tower, the goal is to deal damage to the opponent as quickly as possible. The deck also includes card draw and manipulation effects to ensure a steady stream of threats. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy with a mix of lands that provide colored mana and utility."
