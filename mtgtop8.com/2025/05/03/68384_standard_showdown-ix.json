By playing aggressive threats like Monastery Swiftspear and Cori-Steel Cutter, along with direct damage spells like Burst Lightning and Monstrous Rage, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on while keeping up tempo with card draw and mana fixing. With a mix of creatures, burn spells, and card draw/filtering, this UR aggro deck aims to be a fast and proactive menace on the battlefield."
