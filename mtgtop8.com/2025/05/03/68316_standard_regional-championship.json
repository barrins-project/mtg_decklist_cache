By using cards like Day of Judgment, Lightning Helix, and Temporary Lockdown, the deck aims to maintain board control and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also features powerful finishers like Marang River Regent and Shiko, Paragon of the Way to close out the game once the opponent has been sufficiently controlled. The mana base includes a variety of dual lands to ensure smooth mana production for the three-color deck."
