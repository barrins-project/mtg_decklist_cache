By deploying threats like Nurturing Pixie and Optimistic Scavenger early on, you can quickly put pressure on your opponent while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Fear of Isolation and Hopeless Nightmare. Utilizing cards like This Town Ain't Big Enough and Nowhere to Run, you can control the board and keep your opponent on the back foot. The mana base is designed to support a fast and efficient curve, allowing you to capitalize on your early aggression."

The deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total before they have a chance to stabilize, using cards like Monstrous Rage and Witchstalker Frenzy to pump up creatures for lethal attacks. The mana base includes lands like Rockface Village and Thornspire Verge to ensure consistent access to red mana."
