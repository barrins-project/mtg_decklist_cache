By using cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push to disrupt the opponent's strategy, while also efficiently bringing back creatures with Reanimate and Necrodominance, this deck aims to put pressure on the opponent and finish them off with big creatures like Barrowgoyf and Exsanguinator Cavalry. The inclusion of cards like Opposition Agent and Dauthi Voidwalker also provide additional disruption and value, making this deck a formidable threat in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
