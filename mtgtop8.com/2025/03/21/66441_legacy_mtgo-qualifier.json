The deck utilizes powerful mana acceleration like Dark Ritual and Lotus Petal to quickly cast your spells, while also disrupting your opponent with Thoughtseize and Pact of Negation to ensure your combo goes off without a hitch. Timing and sequencing are crucial to executing this all-in strategy effectively."

The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Noble Hierarch, while also disrupting opponents with cards like Endurance and Collector Ouphe. By using cards like Natural Order and Elvish Reclaimer, the deck can efficiently tutor for key pieces to further solidify its control over the game."
