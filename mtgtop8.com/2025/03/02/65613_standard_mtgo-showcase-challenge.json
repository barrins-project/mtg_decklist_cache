The deck also features cards like Fear of Isolation and Nowhere to Run to control the opponent's board and protect your own creatures. By staying one step ahead of the opponent and maintaining pressure, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The inclusion of cards like Resolute Reinforcements and Regal Bunnicorn also provides additional ways to go wide and pump up the team for a strong finish."

This is achieved through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and board wipes like Day of Judgment. The deck also includes card draw and mana ramp to ensure consistency and stability. The creatures in the deck are resilient and can provide added control on the battlefield. Overall, the deck aims to outlast opponents and secure victory through superior control of the game."
