Cards like Authority of the Consuls and Get Lost help control the board, while Caretaker's Talent and Ride's End allow you to gain advantage. Sunfall and Up the Beanstalk provide additional power and options for your plays. The Overlord cards serve as your powerful finishers, with Beza, the Bounding Spring providing support. The mana base is structured to ensure a smooth curve and consistent access to all necessary colors for your spells."
