The goal is to ramp up mana quickly to get Omniscience on the field, allowing you to cast multiple spells in a turn without paying their mana costs. Fallaji Archaeologist and Picklock Prankster help to support this strategy by either searching for key cards or disrupting the opponent's game plan. Confounding Riddle, Ephara's Dispersal, and Moment of Truth provide additional control options, while Stock Up helps to filter through the deck for combo pieces."
