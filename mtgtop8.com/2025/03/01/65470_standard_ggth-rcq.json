The deck focuses on utilizing cards that provide quick and efficient creature removal, along with mana ramping abilities from Llanowar Elves and land cards. The deck also includes a mix of versatile creatures and spells to maintain board control and push for a fast victory. The overall strategy revolves around overwhelming the opponent with early aggression and efficient card synergy."
