The key strategy is to set up the combo pieces quickly while disrupting the opponent with counterspells and removal spells. The deck aims to win the game by either milling the opponent entirely with Thassa's Oracle or by dealing direct damage with Flame of Anor and Lightning Bolt. The deck also utilizes cards like Urza's Saga and Mox Opal to generate mana efficiently and maintain card advantage."

Additionally, Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student provides card selection and filtering to help find key combo pieces, while disruptive elements like Spell Snare and Malevolent Rumble disrupt the opponent's game plan."

The deck includes cards that support this strategy such as Vodalian Hexcatcher and Tide Shaper, along with powerful lords like Master of the Pearl Trident and Lord of Atlantis to pump up your team. Additionally, disruptive spells like Force of Negation and Flare of Denial help to protect your creatures and maintain pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for faster deployment of creatures, ensuring a consistent and swift offense."
