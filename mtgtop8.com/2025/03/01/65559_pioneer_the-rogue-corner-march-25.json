The addition of enchantments and artifacts like Training Grounds, Profit's Eidetic Memory, and The Enigma Jewel enhance the deck's creatures and provide additional card advantage. Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and other lands like Otawara, Soaring City help generate mana quickly to play multiple threats in a turn. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a consistent stream of creatures and disruption spells."
