The deck aims to maintain card advantage through card selection, card draw, and card advantage creatures like Kaito, Bane of Nightmares, and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student. By efficiently managing resources and answering threats, the deck can outvalue the opponent and secure victory through attrition. The mana base is built to ensure consistency and access to all necessary colors for spells."

It uses cards like Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Urza's Saga to constantly create artifacts on board to fuel the combo. Ancient Tomb and Lotus Petal help accelerate the mana needed to execute the combo quickly. Control elements like Force of Will and Force of Negation are included to protect the combo pieces while also disrupting the opponent's game plan. The key strategy is to assemble the combo pieces efficiently and disrupt the opponent's plans to win the game."
