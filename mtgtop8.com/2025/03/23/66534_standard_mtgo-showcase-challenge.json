The goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can stabilize or mount a defense. Key cards like Monstrous Rage and Monastery Swiftspear help keep the pressure on, while cards like Lightning Strike and Shock provide direct damage to finish off the opponent. With a mix of creatures and burn spells, this deck aims to be a fast and relentless force on the battlefield."

Confounding Riddle, Ephara's Dispersal, and Moment of Truth can provide disruption to the opponent while the player sets up their combo. The deck also includes some removal and card draw to help control the board and maintain hand advantage."
