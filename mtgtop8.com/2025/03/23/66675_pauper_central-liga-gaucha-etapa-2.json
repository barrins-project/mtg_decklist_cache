The strategy is to aggressively attack with creatures like Goblin Bushwhacker and Goblin Tomb Raider while using burn spells like Chain Lightning and Lightning Bolt to finish off the opponent. The deck also utilizes artifacts like Implement of Combustion and Experimental Synthesizer to provide additional damage and card advantage. By maintaining a fast pace and applying constant pressure, the goal is to outpace the opponent and secure a quick victory."
