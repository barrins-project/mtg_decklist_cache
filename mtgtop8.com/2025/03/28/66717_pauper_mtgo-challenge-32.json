The deck includes cards like Galvanic Blast for direct damage, Ichor Wellspring for card draw, and Myr Enforcer as a powerful finisher. The inclusion of cards like Deadly Dispute and Reckoner's Bargain allows for sacrificing artifacts for additional benefits. By leveraging the affinity mechanic and artifact support cards, this aggressive deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence and push for victory."
