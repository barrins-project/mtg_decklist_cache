Key cards like Solitude and Fatal Push help control the board, while creatures like Boggart Trawler and Ketramose, the New Dawn deal damage quickly. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Relic of Progenitus and Thoughtseize to disrupt opponent's plans. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive strategy while also allowing for solid mana fixing. Overall, the deck aims to overpower opponents quickly while disrupting their game plan."
