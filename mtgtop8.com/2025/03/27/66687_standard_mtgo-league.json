            "notes": "The key strategy of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and aggressive creatures, supported by efficient burn spells and combat tricks. The deck focuses on quickly building a board presence with creatures like Emberheart Challenger and Hired Claw, and then using cards like Monstrous Rage and Witchstalker Frenzy to increase damage output. The inclusion of cards like Burst Lightning and Torch the Tower provides additional reach to finish off opponents. The overall goal is to win through unrelenting pressure and efficient use of resources."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the opponent's resources and board state through a combination of hand disruption, removal spells, and card advantage. By using cards like Duress, Go for the Throat, and Deadly Cover-Up, the deck aims to slow down the opponent while generating card advantage through Mazemind Tome and Stock Up. Jace, the Perfected Mind and Oildeep Gearhulk provide additional win conditions for the deck, allowing it to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted."
