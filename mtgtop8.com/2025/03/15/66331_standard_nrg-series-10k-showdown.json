Boros Charm and Monstrous Rage provide additional ways to buff creatures or protect them, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. Overall, the deck excels at fast-paced, aggressive gameplay to secure victories in a 1vs1 format."

It aims to build a wide board presence early in the game, utilizing cards like Dusk Rose Reliquary and Brightglass Gearhulk to quickly close out the game. The inclusion of cards like Get Lost, Split Up, and Shardmage's Rescue allows for disruption and protection against removal spells. The deck also features a mana ramp package with Llanowar Elves and Voyager Glidecar to accelerate its aggressive game plan."
