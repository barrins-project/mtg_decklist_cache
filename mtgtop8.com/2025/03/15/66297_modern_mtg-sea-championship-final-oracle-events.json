By controlling the board and the opponent's resources, the deck aims to slowly grind out a victory by efficiently dealing with threats and maintaining card advantage. The inclusion of cards like Murktide Regent and Psychic Frog provides powerful finishers to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. Additionally, the deck has a versatile sideboard to adapt to different matchups and strategies."

Cards like Guide of Souls and Ranger-Captain of Eos help in maintaining card advantage and consistency, while Static Prison and Arena of Glory provide control and protection. The deck is designed to quickly take control of the game and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."

The deck also includes disruption cards like Fatal Push and Drown in the Loch to control the board and prevent counterplay. The combo aspect comes from the synergy between milling cards and cards like Tasha's Hideous Laughter or Jace, the Perfected Mind to mill large amounts of cards at once. Surgical Extraction is included to remove key cards from the opponent's graveyard to disrupt their strategy."
