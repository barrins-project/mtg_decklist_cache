The deck also runs disruptive elements like Pithing Needle and Swan Song to protect the combo and control the board, while cards like Urza's Saga and Mishra's Bauble provide additional value and consistency."

With a suite of counterspells, hand disruption spells, and removal, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's threats and prevent them from executing their strategies effectively. The deck also includes card draw and filtering to ensure consistency and access to key cards. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue the opponent by staying ahead on resources and controlling the game until victory can be achieved."

By controlling the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Terminus, the goal is to outlast the opponent and win the game through incremental advantage. Combining powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Time Raveler with efficient spells like Spell Snare and Force of Negation, the deck aims to outmaneuver the opponent and control the pace of the game until victory is achieved."
