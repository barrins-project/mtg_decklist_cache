With a mix of creature removal, card draw, and mana acceleration, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building up its own board presence. The deck focuses on generating value through sacrificing creatures and artifacts, allowing the player to maintain pressure and adapt to various game situations. Additionally, the inclusion of land destruction spells adds an element of disruption to further hinder the opponent's strategy."
