With a focus on generating extra mana early on, you can quickly play out strong threats like Nyxborn Hydra and Bannerhide Krushok to pressure your opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. Writhing Chrysalis provides additional removal options while Malevolent Rumble can help clear the way for your creatures to attack unchecked."
