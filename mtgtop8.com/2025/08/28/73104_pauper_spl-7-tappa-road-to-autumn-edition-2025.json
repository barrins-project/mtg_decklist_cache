By utilizing cards that benefit from having artifacts in play, such as Reckoner's Bargain and Refurbished Familiar, the player can quickly build a board presence and deal damage efficiently. With the ability to generate card advantage through cards like Thoughtcast and Ichor Wellspring, as well as removal options like Galvanic Blast and Krark-Clan Shaman, this deck is designed to apply constant pressure and win before the opponent can stabilize."
