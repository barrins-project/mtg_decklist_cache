The key strategy is to efficiently use spells to enable the recursion of Arclight Phoenix while also maintaining card advantage and controlling the board with removal spells. By carefully planning your plays and managing resources effectively, you can overwhelm your opponent with a flurry of powerful spells and creatures."
