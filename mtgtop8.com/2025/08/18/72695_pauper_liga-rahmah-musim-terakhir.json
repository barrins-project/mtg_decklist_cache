The deck focuses on flooding the board with a variety of weenie creatures such as Novice Inspector and Mardu Devotee, while also utilizing cards like Thraben Charm and Guardians' Pledge to buff them up for a swift victory. The deck also includes some lifegain elements like Suture Priest and Kor Skyfisher to help sustain aggro pressure. The goal is to quickly build a strong board presence and push for damage before the opponent can stabilize."
