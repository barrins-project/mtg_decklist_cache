            "notes": "This deck focuses on using sacrificing and recurring creatures to disrupt the opponent's strategy while steadily building up resources. It takes advantage of graveyard interactions and card draw options to maintain a steady flow of threats. The combination of removal spells, creature recursion, and sacrifice outlets provide a versatile and aggressive strategy that can overwhelm opponents by constantly pressuring the board and disrupting their game plan. The mana base is designed to support the color requirements of the spells and enable consistent plays throughout the game."
