The key strategy is to use the mana acceleration from cards like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic to cast Collected Company and flood the board with Elves. Cards like Elvish Archdruid and Steel Leaf Champion provide additional power and resilience, while Surge of Salvation and Banner of Kinship help pump up the team for a big attack. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of Elves and win the game before the opponent can stabilize."

By combining cards like Witch's Oven and Cauldron Familiar for a recurring sacrifice loop, along with powerful creatures like Yagra, Eater of All and Vinereap Mentor, this deck aims to control the board and apply pressure early in the game. With removal spells like Fatal Push and The Meathook Massacre, this deck can deal with opposing threats while building up a strong board presence. The key strategy is to grind out value from sacrificing creatures and overwhelm the opponent with efficient threats."
