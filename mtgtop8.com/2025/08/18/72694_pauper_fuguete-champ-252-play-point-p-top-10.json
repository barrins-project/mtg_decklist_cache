By utilizing cards like Sunscape Familiar and God-Pharaoh's Faithful to generate mana advantage, combined with flicker effects like Ghostly Flicker and Snap, the deck can outvalue opponents while countering threats with cards like Prohibit and Foil. The key is to maintain board presence and card advantage while disrupting the opponent's game plan until you can overwhelm them with powerful late-game threats like Mulldrifter and Murmuring Mystic."
