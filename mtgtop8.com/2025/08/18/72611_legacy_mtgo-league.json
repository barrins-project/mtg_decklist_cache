The deck also aims to generate value from land synergies with cards like Urza's Saga and Wasteland, as well as token generation from Eumidian Hatchery. Overall, the deck seeks to grind out incremental advantages and outvalue the opponent through resource denial and strategic graveyard manipulation."
