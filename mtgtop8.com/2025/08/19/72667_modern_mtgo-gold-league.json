By quickly getting creatures on the board like Seasoned Pyromancer, Ragavan, and Guide of Souls, and using cards like Galvanic Discharge and Goblin Bombardment for direct damage, the deck aims to aggressively reduce the opponent's life total. Additionally, the inclusion of Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury provide versatile threats to further pressure the opponent. The deck also includes utility cards like Arena of Glory and Static Prison for control and disruption."
