Utilizing the affinity mechanic, the deck aims to play multiple artifacts for cheap or for free, enabling quick and efficient board development. With cards like Urza's Saga and Thought Monitor, the deck can generate card advantage and create threats while maintaining a low mana curve. By combining artifact synergy with fast and aggressive plays, the deck aims to outpace and overpower the opponent in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."
