By ramping up with mana dorks like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic, and utilizing cards like Leyline of the Guildpact and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx, the deck aims to quickly cast powerful green creatures like Old-Growth Troll and Cavalier of Thorns. With support from cards like Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner and Storm the Festival, the deck can overwhelm opponents with its devotion to green mana and strong creature presence."
