By utilizing cards that provide card advantage and efficient mana use, the deck aims to maintain a steady stream of threats while disrupting the opponent's game plan with counter spells and removal. The inclusion of creatures with abilities that benefit from attacking, such as Mockingbird and Sentinel of the Nameless City, ensures that the deck maintains pressure on the opponent and finishes the game swiftly."
