The inclusion of win conditions like Kaito, Bane of Nightmares and Psychic Frog ensures the deck has a way to close out the game once it has gained control."

By utilizing cards like Lotus Bloom and Whir of Invention to ramp up mana, the deck aims to quickly assemble the necessary components to activate Goblin Charbelcher's ability and deal lethal damage to the opponent in a single turn. The deck lacks traditional land cards and instead relies on non-land sources of mana to power its combo strategy."
