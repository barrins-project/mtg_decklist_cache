With cards like Street Wraith and Curator of Mysteries, the deck can cycle through the deck quickly to find the combo pieces needed. Force of Negation and Endurance also provide disruption and protection for the combo. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large number of creatures all coming back at once, often catching them off guard and leading to a swift victory."
