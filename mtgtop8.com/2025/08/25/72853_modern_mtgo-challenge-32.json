By utilizing cards like Teferi, Time Raveler for tempo advantage, Stock Up for card draw, and Ephemerate for recursion, the deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent. With a well-balanced mix of interaction and card advantage, the deck seeks to grind out incremental advantages and ultimately dominate the late game with powerful finishers like Wrath of the Skies and Solitude."
