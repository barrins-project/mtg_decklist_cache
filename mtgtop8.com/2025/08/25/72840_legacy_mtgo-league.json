The inclusion of Urza's Saga allows for the deck to tutor for powerful artifacts and create a strong board presence. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive affinity strategy."

The goal is to assemble key pieces such as Grim Monolith, Manifold Key, and Voltaic Key to generate infinite mana, while using Mystic Forge to play cards off the top of the library. Tezzeret, Cruel Captain and Karn, the Great Creator provide additional utility and synergy with artifacts, ultimately aiming to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of resources and threats."
