The deck utilizes cards that enhance creature abilities, provide card advantage, and disrupt the opponent's strategy. By utilizing a combination of fast creatures like Llanowar Elves and Spyglass Siren, alongside disruptive spells like Spell Pierce and Repulsive Mutation, the deck can quickly build a strong board presence and put pressure on the opponent. The mana base is optimized for both green and blue mana sources to support the deck's Simic color identity."
