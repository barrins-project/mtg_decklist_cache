This allows for a quick win condition with cards like Griselbrand or Planar Genesis. The deck also includes disruption and protection spells like Pact of Negation and Veil of Summer to ensure the combo's success."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by using the powerful UrzaTron lands to ramp up and play big threats like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Thought-Knot Seer. Cards like Mystic Forge and Karn, the Great Creator allow for card advantage and flexibility in dealing with a variety of threats. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while assembling its own win condition through the use of powerful Eldrazi creatures and artifacts. Provoking quick and heavy pressure on the opponent while maintaining control of the board is key to success."
