The goal is to establish early board presence with efficient creatures like Glint Hawk and Kor Skyfisher, while using cards like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt to remove blockers and finish off opponents. The deck aims to close out games quickly before the opponent can stabilize and mount a defense."

By combining burn spells like Chain Lightning and Lightning Bolt with creatures like Sneaky Snacker and Voldaren Epicure, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Alms of the Vein and Vampire's Kiss provide additional reach and life gain to keep the pressure on. The mana base includes dual lands to ensure consistency in casting both red and black spells."
