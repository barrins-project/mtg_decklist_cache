The inclusion of control elements like Static Prison and Blood Moon can disrupt opponents' strategies, while cards like Seasoned Pyromancer and Voice of Victory provide card advantage and resilience. The mana base is streamlined to consistently cast threats and spells efficiently."

Once you have enough creatures in the graveyard, casting Living End will create a huge board presence that can overwhelm your opponent.

            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing the Amulet of Vigor to generate extra mana and untap lands when playing powerful creatures like Primeval Titan. By utilizing lands that provide additional effects or abilities such as Urza's Saga and Boseiju, Who Endures, the deck aims to quickly set up combos to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Cultivator Colossus or Aftermath Analyst. Through the use of cards like Scapeshift and Malevolent Rumble, the deck can quickly ramp up and search for key pieces to create a dominant board state and win the game."

It also utilizes disruptive elements such as Solitude and Witch Enchanter to slow down the opponent's game plan. The deck includes a mix of creatures with powerful abilities like Flickerwisp and Emperor of Bones. Aether Vial is used to cheat creatures into play quickly, while Ephemerate provides additional value by reusing creature abilities. Fatal Push and Prismatic Ending help deal with opposing threats, while the manabase includes a variety of lands to ensure consistent access to different colors of mana."
