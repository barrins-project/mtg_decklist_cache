The deck utilizes a combination of low-cost creatures like Burnout Bashtronaut and Razorkin Needlehead, along with powerful finishers like Nova Hellkite and Ojer Axonil. The burn spells like Burst Lightning and Obliterating Bolt provide additional reach to close out games, while cards like Scalding Viper and Hired Claw help maintain board presence. Overall, the deck focuses on fast, efficient aggression to quickly defeat the opponent."
