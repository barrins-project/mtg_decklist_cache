With cards like Snuff Out, Cast Down, and Defile, the deck aims to deal with opponent's threats efficiently. Additionally, cards like Pulse of Murasa and Lembas help to regain lost life, while Ichor Wellspring provides card advantage. The inclusion of cards like Crypt Rats and Troll of Khazad-dÃ»m allows for board control, while the mana base of the deck supports these strategies effectively."
