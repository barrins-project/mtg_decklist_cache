            "notes": "The main concept of this UR Aggro deck is to aggressively play low-cost creatures and spells to quickly overwhelm the opponent. The deck focuses on tempo and card advantage by utilizing cards like Fear of Missing Out, Marauding Mako, and Vivi Ornitier to apply pressure early on. The deck also includes disruptive spells like Abrade and Spell Pierce to control the board and protect its creatures. Additionally, the deck utilizes card draw and recursion through cards like Proft's Eidetic Memory and Agatha's Soul Cauldron to maintain consistency and push for victory."
