The Eldrazi creatures like Emrakul, the Promised End and World Breaker serve as powerful finishers, while cards like Writhing Chrysalis and Sowing Mycospawn provide additional threats. The deck also utilizes ramp spells like Utopia Sprawl and Talisman of Impulse to accelerate its mana production and cast its big threats ahead of schedule."

It also incorporates some flicker effects to gain additional value from enters-the-battlefield triggers. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, limit their resources, and gradually wear them down with a mix of powerful threats and disruptive elements. By combining aggressive creatures with disruptive elements, the deck aims to force the opponent into unfavorable positions and secure victory through tempo advantage and card advantage."
