By maximizing aggressive creatures like Kitchen Imp and Voldaren Epicure, along with removal spells like Fiery Temper and Lightning Bolt, the deck can quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Alms of the Vein and Vampire's Kiss provide crucial life gain to keep the player alive while continuing to apply pressure. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creature aggression and burn spells."
