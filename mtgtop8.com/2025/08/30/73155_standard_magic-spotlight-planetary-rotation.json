The deck focuses on playing low-cost creatures like Vivi Ornitier and Marauding Mako to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Cards like Fear of Missing Out and Quantum Riddler provide additional damage and card advantage. Agatha's Soul Cauldron and Into the Flood Maw help to maintain board control and push for the final damage. The deck includes a mix of instant and sorcery spells for removal and disruption. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive playstyle with a mix of Islands, Mountains, and dual lands."
