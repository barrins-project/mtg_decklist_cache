By utilizing cost reduction and card draw effects, the deck aims to maintain a steady stream of threats and removal options to control the board and pressure the opponent. The inclusion of direct damage spells like Galvanic Blast adds extra reach to finish off the opponent quickly. Additionally, the deck utilizes various artifact lands to maximize its synergy with cards like Myr Enforcer and Thoughtcast."
