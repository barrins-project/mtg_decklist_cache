The deck aims to control the board early on with cards like Journey to Nowhere and Lightning Bolt, while also applying pressure with efficient creatures like Kor Skyfisher and Glint Hawk. The deck also includes some artifact synergies with Experimental Synthesizer and Black Mage's Rod to provide additional value and card advantage. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive game plan with a mix of lands that provide colored mana and can also trigger landfall abilities."
