The deck utilizes a variety of fast mana, powerful discard spells, and graveyard recursion to assemble the combo pieces, protect the combo, and disrupt the opponent's game plan. It sacrifices card advantage and stability for the explosiveness and speed needed to win the game before the opponent can effectively respond."

By utilizing cards that provide mana acceleration, card selection, and graveyard recursion, the deck can consistently assemble a game-winning combo by milling the entire library and winning through alternative win conditions like Thassa's Oracle or tokens generated by Bridge from Below. Through careful sequencing and manipulation of resources, this deck can quickly overwhelm opponents and secure victory before traditional control or aggro decks can establish a strong board presence."
