The deck focuses on quickly building a board presence with creatures like Geralf, the Fleshwright and Vivi Ornitier, while utilizing spells like Fear of Missing Out and Torch the Tower to control the board and push damage through. By maintaining a steady stream of threats and efficient removal, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory."
