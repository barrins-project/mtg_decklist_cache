By using counterspells, removal, and card draw, the deck aims to maintain board control and outvalue the opponent. This is achieved through a combination of efficient creatures, board wipes, and card advantage spells. The deck also includes a few finishers to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. Overall, the deck seeks to control the game and outlast the opponent through careful resource management and strategic plays."
