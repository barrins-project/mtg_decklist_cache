            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent quickly with aggressive creatures and direct damage spells. By utilizing powerful dragons like Nova Hellkite and Sarkhan, Dragon Ascendant, along with supporting cards like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to deal damage fast and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Magda, the Hoardmaster and Soulstone Sanctuary provides additional value and resources to keep up the pressure on the opponent. Overall, the deck focuses on fast, aggressive gameplay to secure a victory before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
