With a mix of creatures and spells that can both deal direct damage and control the board, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a strong defense. Cards like Terror of the Peaks and Anticausal Vestige provide powerful threats, while cards like Spell Pierce and Ill-Timed Explosion help disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck's mana base is heavily skewed towards blue, allowing for a consistent stream of spells to be played."
