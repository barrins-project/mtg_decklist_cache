By leveraging cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum for mana acceleration, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents early in the game with a combination of aggressive creatures and powerful artifact synergy. The inclusion of Urza's Saga and Aether Spellbomb provide additional utility and consistency to the deck's game plan, allowing it to maintain pressure and disrupt opponents while staying focused on winning through fast, aggressive attacks."
