            "notes": "The main concept of this UR Aggro deck is to quickly deploy low-cost aggressive creatures like Dragon's Rage Channeler and Monastery Swiftspear, and back them up with spells like Lightning Bolt and Mutagenic Growth to deal damage directly to the opponent. Slickshot Show-Off and Cori-Steel Cutter provide additional threats and disruption, while cards like Mishra's Bauble and Expressive Iteration help maintain card advantage and filter through the deck. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive game plan, with fetch lands and shock lands to ensure consistent access to red mana for the aggressive spells."
