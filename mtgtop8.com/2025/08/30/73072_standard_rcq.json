The key is to maintain board presence with cards like Spyglass Siren and Floodpits Drowner while using Enduring Curiosity to draw more cards and keep the pressure on. Cards like Tishana's Tidebinder and Sunset Saboteur can provide additional control and disruption. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient creatures and maintain momentum throughout the game."
