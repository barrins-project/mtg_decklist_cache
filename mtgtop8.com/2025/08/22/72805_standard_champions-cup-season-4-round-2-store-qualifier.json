Cecil, Dark Knight and Kaito, Bane of Nightmares provide additional threats, and Bitter Triumph and Tragic Trajectory offer removal options.

By quickly playing threats like Kaito, Bane of Nightmares and Floodpits Drowner, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to establish their own game plan. Utilizing key interactions such as Shoot the Sheriff and Spyglass Siren, the Dimir Aggro deck seeks to disrupt the opponent's strategy while continuously applying pressure. The deck's versatility and resource management make it a formidable force in the Standard 1 vs 1 format."
