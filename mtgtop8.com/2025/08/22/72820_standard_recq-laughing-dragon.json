By controlling the game pace and resource management, it aims to outvalue the opponent and secure victory through late-game threats such as Marang River Regent and Overlord of the Mistmoors. The mana base is optimized for consistency and to support the deck's control elements. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and maintain board control throughout the game."
