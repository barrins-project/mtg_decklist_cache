By utilizing creatures with powerful ETB effects like Ephemerate and Solitude, the deck aims to control the board while applying pressure with evasive creatures like Mockingbird and Ocelot Pride. Haliya, Guide of Light provides additional protection for key creatures, while Witch Enchanter and Quantum Riddler generate card advantage. The deck's mana base is fine-tuned to ensure consistency and flexibility in casting spells while maintaining aggressive tempo."
