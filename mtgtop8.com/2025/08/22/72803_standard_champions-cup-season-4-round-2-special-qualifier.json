            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressive tactics with efficient creatures like Steamcore Scholar and Marauding Mako to apply early pressure. Fear of Missing Out and Vivi Ornitier help maintain card advantage and tempo. Agatha's Soul Cauldron and Winternight Stories provide additional ways to gain advantage and control the board. Quantum Riddler and Proft's Eidetic Memory offer card selection and filtering. Abrade and Obliterating Bolt act as removal spells, while Into the Flood Maw and Wild Ride provide additional burst damage. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize consistency in casting spells."
