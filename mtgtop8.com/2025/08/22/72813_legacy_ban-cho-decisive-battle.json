The inclusion of cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Chrome Mox allows for explosive starts, while cards like Thorn of Amethyst and City of Traitors provide disruption and additional mana acceleration. The deck is designed to be efficient, relentless, and focused on winning the game as quickly as possible."
