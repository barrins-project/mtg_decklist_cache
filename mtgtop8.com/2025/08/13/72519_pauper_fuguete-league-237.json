By utilizing cheap burn spells such as Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, as well as mass pump effects like Wrenn's Resolve and Rally at the Hornburg, the deck aims to deal significant damage early on and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The low land count and high creature density ensure a fast and relentless attack strategy."
