By using cards like Springleaf Drum and Mox Opal, the player can generate large amounts of mana to cast threats like Arcbound Ravager and Thought Monitor. Urza's Saga provides additional value by searching for key artifacts, while Weapons Manufacturing and Kappa Cannoneer help control the board. With a focus on speed and aggression, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents before they can establish their own game plan."
