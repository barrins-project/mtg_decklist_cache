            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively control the board and apply pressure to the opponent's life total as quickly as possible. By efficiently utilizing low-cost creatures like Marauding Mako and Tersa Lightshatter, along with powerful spell cards such as Fear of Missing Out and Winternight Stories, the deck aims to establish dominance early in the game. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Abrade and Into the Flood Maw provides additional removal options to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to both blue and red mana sources for casting spells."
