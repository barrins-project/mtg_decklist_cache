By combining low-cost threats like Spyglass Siren and Floodpits Drowner with powerful finishers like Kaito, Bane of Nightmares and Lazav, Wearer of Faces, the deck aims to constantly put pressure on the opponent. Support cards like Enduring Curiosity and Tragic Trajectory help maintain card advantage and control the board. Overall, the deck seeks to quickly establish a dominant board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

With cards like Agatha's Soul Cauldron and Profit's Eidetic Memory generating card advantage, the deck aims to maintain pressure and close out the game swiftly. Additionally, Quantum Riddler and Into the Flood Maw offer versatile options for dealing with a variety of threats."
