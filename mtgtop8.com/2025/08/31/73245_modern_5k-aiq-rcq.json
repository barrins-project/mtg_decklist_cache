The inclusion of graveyard interaction cards like Cling to Dust and Unearth adds an extra layer of strategy to the deck, while the creatures like Abhorrent Oculus and Psychic Frog provide additional control options. The deck also includes a strong mana base to support its control-heavy gameplay."

The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan by countering their spells, removing their threats, and generating card advantage through cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Ephemerate. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind out a win through attrition, using cards like Stock Up, Tune the Narrative, and Quantum Riddler to maintain resources and eventually win the game with powerful finishers like Wrath of the Skies and Solitude."
