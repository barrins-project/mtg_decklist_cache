By using cards like Goblin Charbelcher and Lotus Bloom, along with counterspells and disruption, the deck aims to control the game and set up a win condition that can be difficult for opponents to interact with. By leveraging cards that manipulate spells and mana, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up a powerful combo finish. The deck's strength lies in its ability to quickly assemble its combo pieces and execute its win condition before the opponent can respond effectively."
