The key strategy involves assembling the Urzatron lands as soon as possible to generate large amounts of mana, allowing for the casting of powerful creatures like Maelstrom Colossus and Bramble Wurm. The deck also includes removal spells like Malevolent Rumble to deal with threats, along with card draw effects like Ancient Stirrings and Candy Trail to maintain card advantage."
