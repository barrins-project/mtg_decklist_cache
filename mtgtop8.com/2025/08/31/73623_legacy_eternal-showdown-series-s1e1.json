The inclusion of counterspells like Force of Will and Flusterstorm helps protect key combo pieces, while cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder ensure consistency in drawing into the necessary cards for the combo."

The deck also includes disruptive elements like Thoughtseize and Daze to help protect the combo and control the opponent's game plan. Overall, the goal is to assemble the combo pieces efficiently and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats from the graveyard."
