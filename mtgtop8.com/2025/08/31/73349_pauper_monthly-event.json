The deck includes cards that help to quickly build a board presence, such as Lunarch Veteran and Thraben Inspector, while also including cards like Dawnbringer Cleric and Exosuit Savior for added protection. With powerful anthems like Guardians' Pledge and Battle Screech, the deck aims to go wide and go tall, overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of creatures. The key strategy is to maintain pressure and force the opponent to react to the constant threats on the battlefield."
