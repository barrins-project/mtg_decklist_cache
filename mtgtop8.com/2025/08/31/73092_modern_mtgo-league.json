It utilizes cards like Path to Exile and Wrath of the Skies to remove threats, while also incorporating cards like Relic of Progenitus to disrupt graveyard strategies. Crucible of Worlds allows for consistent land destruction with cards like Field of Ruin and Ghost Quarter. Karn, the Great Creator provides additional disruption and utility. The deck also includes win conditions like Solitude and White Orchid Phantom to close out the game. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and overwhelm them with control elements."
