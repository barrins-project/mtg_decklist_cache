            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing cheap artifacts to boost the power of creatures and enable quick aggressive plays. By efficiently casting creatures like Myr Enforcer and Glint Hawk while also drawing cards with Thoughtcast, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a high number of threats. The artifact lands provide additional mana sources and synergize well with cards like Kor Skyfisher and Cryogen Relic. With a balance of creature aggression and card advantage, this Aggro - Affinity deck aims to quickly establish board presence and outpace the opponent."
