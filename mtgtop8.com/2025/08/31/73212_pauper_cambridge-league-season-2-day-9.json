            "notes": "The main focus of the deck is to quickly establish a board presence with small, efficient creatures like Brinebarrow Intruder and Faerie Miscreant, while disrupting the opponent's game plan with countermagic like Counterspell and Spell Pierce. Moon-Circuit Hacker and Unstable Mutation provide additional ways to pump up the creatures and close out the game quickly. The deck also includes card draw with Of One Mind and tempo plays with Run Away Together. Ninja of the Deep Hours offers card advantage through its ability, making sure the deck maintains pressure on the opponent."
