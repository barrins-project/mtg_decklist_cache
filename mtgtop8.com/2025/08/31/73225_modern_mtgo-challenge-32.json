The deck focuses on efficient mana generation and protection while using Urza's Saga to tutor for key artifacts. The inclusion of cards like Spell Pierce and Esper Sentinel helps to disrupt opponents' game plans while maintaining card advantage. The deck aims to be fast and explosive, overwhelming opponents before they can respond effectively."
