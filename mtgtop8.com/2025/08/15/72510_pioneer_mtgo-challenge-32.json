The main win condition is to outvalue the opponent through efficient removal and powerful planeswalkers, eventually overwhelming them with card advantage and powerful threats like The Wandering Emperor. Additionally, the inclusion of Kaheera, the Orphanguard as a companion allows for additional utility and options in certain matchups."
