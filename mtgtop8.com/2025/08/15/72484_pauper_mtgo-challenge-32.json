            "notes": "The main objective of this deck is to efficiently fill the graveyard with creature cards, such as Lotleth Giant and Stinkweed Imp, and then bring them back to the battlefield with cards like Dread Return. By utilizing the combination of reanimation spells and self-mill effects, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures like Scrapwork Mutt and Troll of Khazad-dûm. Additionally, cards like Gnaw to the Bone and Malevolent Rumble provide the necessary support to sustain and protect the combo strategy."
