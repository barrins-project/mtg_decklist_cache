The inclusion of cards like Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker provide powerful boosts for your creatures. The deck also utilizes burn spells like Galvanic Discharge and Thraben Charm for additional reach. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient aggro strategy while maintaining some control elements."

The deck focuses on tempo, card advantage, and applying pressure early in the game to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. With cantrips like Preordain and Mishra's Bauble to filter through the deck and find the right cards, this deck aims to win the game swiftly and decisively."
