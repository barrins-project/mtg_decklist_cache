Collected Company and Kayla's Reconstruction help to flood the board with creatures, while cards like Giada, Font of Hope and Skyclave Apparition provide additional value and removal options. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggro pressure and resilience, utilizing cards like Inspiring Overseer and Enduring Innocence to further strengthen its creatures."
