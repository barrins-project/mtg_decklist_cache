The key strategy involves using efficient removal like Abrade and Torch the Tower to clear the way for powerful attackers like Marauding Mako and Tersa Lightshatter. Winternight Stories and Profit's Eidetic Memory provide card advantage, while cards like Fear of Missing Out and Agatha's Soul Cauldron help maintain pressure on the opponent. This deck aims to win the game quickly by applying constant aggression and utilizing a mix of burn, creatures, and card advantage."
