It combines removal spells and counterspells with efficient creatures like Nethergoyf and Murktide Regent to control the board and chip away at the opponent's life points. The deck aims to keep the opponent on the back foot by using tempo plays like Daze and bouncing spells with Brazen Borrower, while also utilizing powerful planeswalkers like Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student for additional card advantage and utility. The goal is to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent to secure victory."
