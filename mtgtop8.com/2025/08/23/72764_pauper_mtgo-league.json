Using cards like Guardians' Pledge and Battle Screech, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent with multiple creatures on the battlefield. Prismatic Strands provides protection for your creatures, while Militia Bugler helps to dig for more threats. Palace Sentinels and Eagles of the North serve as late-game finishers to seal the victory. Overall, this deck aims to swarm the opponent with a rapid assault of weenie white creatures."
