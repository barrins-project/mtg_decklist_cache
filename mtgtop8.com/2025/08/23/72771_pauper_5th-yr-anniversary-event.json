It aims to assemble the Urzatron lands (Urza's Tower, Mine, Power Plant) to generate large amounts of mana and play powerful spells like Mulldrifter and Stonehorn Dignitary. The deck also includes tools for recursion, such as Mnemonic Wall and Pulse of Murasa, along with ways to protect yourself from aggro decks like Moment's Peace and Weather the Storm. The goal is to outlast your opponent and win through card advantage and overwhelming board presence."
