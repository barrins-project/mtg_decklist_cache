The deck aims to control the board and card advantage, eventually winning the game through incremental advantage and powerful late-game threats like Quantum Riddler. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's game plan and ensure consistency in casting spells."

The key is to quickly assemble the pieces for a explosive turn using cards like Pyretic Ritual, Manamorphose, and Ral, Monsoon Mage to cast a critical mass of spells in a single turn. The goal is to find and utilize Past in Flames to flashback spells from the graveyard for a lethal burst of damage with cards like Glimpse the Impossible and Reckless Impulse supported by Wrenn's Resolve and Ruby Medallion to reduce costs."
