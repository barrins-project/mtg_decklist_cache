The deck also includes utility lands like Fountainport and Restless Anchorage to help generate card advantage and mana advantage."

Shardmage's Rescue and Sheltered by Ghosts provide protection for your creatures, while Fae Flight and Valgavoth's Lair offer additional flying threats. Seam Rip and Profit's Eidetic Memory provide removal and card advantage, allowing you to maintain pressure on the opponent."
