By combining aggressive creatures like Voldaren Epicure and Sneaky Snacker with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fiery Temper, the deck aims to deal damage efficiently and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, cards like Faithless Looting and Grab the Prize help to filter through the deck and find key pieces, while Alms of the Vein provides a source of lifegain to offset aggressive strategies."
