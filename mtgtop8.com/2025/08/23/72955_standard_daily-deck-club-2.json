            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to gain control over the game by disrupting the opponent's strategy and maintaining card advantage. By utilizing cards such as Consult the Star Charts, Get Lost, and No More Lies, the player can manipulate their opponent's hand and board state. Additionally, the deck includes board wipes like Day of Judgment and removal spells like Seam Rip to deal with threats. The win condition is to either overwhelm the opponent with creatures like Overlord of the Mistmoors and Marang River Regent, or to utilize Ultima for a powerful finish."
