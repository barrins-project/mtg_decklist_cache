            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining a fast and aggressive tempo. It combines early disruption cards such as Thoughtseize and Force of Will with efficient removal spells like Fatal Push to control the board. The deck also runs card draw engines like Ponder and Brainstorm to maintain card advantage. Murktide Regent and Nethergoyf provide strong threats in the mid to late game, while Brazen Borrower offers versatility. Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student helps dig for key cards, while the mana base ensures consistent access to all necessary colors."
