The deck also includes powerful burn spells like Sundering Eruption and Fury to deal with opposing threats, as well as lock pieces like Chalice of the Void to further disrupt the opponent's game plan.

The deck also includes disruption elements like Force of Will and Daze to protect the combo.

By locking down the opponent's resources, the deck aims to establish early dominance and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive threats like Pyrogoyf and Fury. Additionally, cards like Urza's Saga and Chrome Mox provide additional mana sources to accelerate the deck's game plan, while cards like Fable of the Mirror-Breaker offer additional ways to disrupt the opponent's strategy."
