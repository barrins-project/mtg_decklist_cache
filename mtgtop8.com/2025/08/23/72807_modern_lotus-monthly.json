Thoughtseize and Spell Pierce help protect the combo pieces from disruption, while Fatal Push deals with opposing threats. Consign to Memory provides card advantage, and Harbinger of the Seas and Meltdown act as additional disruption. The deck aims to quickly reanimate powerful creatures while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
