The key strategy involves utilizing powerful control spells such as Counterspell and Journey to Nowhere to disrupt the opponent's plans, while also utilizing the card advantage from Squadron Hawk and The Modern Age. The deck aims to survive the early game with cheap creatures like Sacred Cat and then take over the game with resilient threats like Guardian of the Guildpact. The gates provide fixing and mana advantage, allowing for smooth gameplay and consistency in the deck's strategy."
