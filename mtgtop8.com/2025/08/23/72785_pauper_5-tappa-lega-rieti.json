The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast-paced aggressive strategy, using cards like Gearseeker Serpent and Myr Enforcer to apply pressure. Cards such as Galvanic Blast provide direct damage to finish off opponents, while Thoughtcast and Reckoner's Bargain help draw into more threats. The inclusion of cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Cryogen Relic provide some disruption and control elements to the deck."
