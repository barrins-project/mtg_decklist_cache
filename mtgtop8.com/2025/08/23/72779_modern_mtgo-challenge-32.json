The deck aims to maintain card advantage, slow down the opponent's game plan, and eventually win through incremental advantage and powerful planeswalker threats like Teferi, Time Raveler and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. Additionally, the inclusion of Kaheera, the Orphanguard as a companion provides an additional creature threat and synergizes well with the deck's control elements. The deck prioritizes maintaining control of the game and outvaluing the opponent over aggressive strategies."
