With a mix of counter spells, card draw, and removal, the deck aims to control the game while setting up for a big combo finish. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful burst of damage or disruption before they can respond effectively."

By filling up the graveyard with cards like Thought Scour and Faithless Looting, the deck aims to bring back big creatures like Archon of Cruelty and Emperor of Bones with cards like Persist and Unearth. The deck also includes disruption elements like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push to control the board while setting up the combo. The main win condition is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful reanimated creatures while maintaining control and tempo."

Urza's Saga provides additional artifact synergy and tutor options, while Metallic Rebuke serves as a versatile counterspell to protect the game plan. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and outpace the opponent before they can establish their own board presence."
