The deck includes a mix of removal, board wipes, counter spells, and card draw options to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent. The deck also utilizes a small number of creatures for added flexibility and threat potential. This control strategy aims to keep the opponent on the defensive and ultimately outpace them in card advantage and board presence."
