It utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student to generate card advantage and protect its own threats. By using cards like Back to Basics and Swords to Plowshares, the deck aims to maintain board presence and stall the opponent's advances until it can establish a winning board state with cards like Thundertrap Trainer and Flame of Anor."
