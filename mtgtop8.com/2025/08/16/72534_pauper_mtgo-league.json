The inclusion of removal spells and graveyard hate cards provide additional versatility and disruption to control the board. The combination of creature threats and direct damage potential make this deck a potent aggro option in the Pauper format, especially against slower or more controlling decks."

Timberwatch Elf is a key card for pumping up the creatures and overwhelming the opponent, ultimately aiming to win through sheer numbers and aggression."
