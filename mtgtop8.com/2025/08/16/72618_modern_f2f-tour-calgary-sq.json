This deck aims to disrupt the opponent's resources and tempo, while also providing a clock with efficient creatures. The deck also has a flicker package with cards like Ephemerate and Flickerwisp, allowing for additional value and protection for key creatures. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of disruption and aggression."
