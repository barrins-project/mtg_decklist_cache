By using cards like Flickerwisp and Solitude to temporarily remove threats, combined with cards like Thoughtseize to strip their hand of key cards, the deck aims to control the board and prevent the opponent from developing their strategy. Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd and Emperor of Bones provide strong aggro threats to close out the game quickly. Overall, the deck seeks to maintain a balance between disruption and aggression to outpace the opponent and secure victory."
