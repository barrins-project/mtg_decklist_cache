The deck focuses on stalling the opponent's board development with cards like Day of Judgment and Final Showdown, while also maintaining card advantage and resources with Consult the Star Charts and Stock Up. The win condition is to gradually wear down the opponent's resources and eventually overwhelm them with powerful creatures like Horned Loch-Whale and Marang River Regent. The deck also includes some land destruction elements to disrupt the opponent's mana base."
