The key concept revolves around assembling the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Mine, Power Plant, Tower) to generate massive amounts of mana, allowing for the casting of high-impact spells and creatures like Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, the Eye of the Storms. The deck also includes a number of Eldrazi creatures that can quickly close out the game once the opponent's board is under control."

Cards like Force of Negation and Subtlety provide additional control options, while cards like Sink into Stupor and Kozilek's Command help disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent with a combination of control elements and powerful threats, ultimately leading to victory through card advantage and board control."
