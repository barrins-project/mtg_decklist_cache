It employs a mix of evasion, card draw, and disruption to overwhelm opponents quickly. By utilizing the Simic color combination, the deck aims to leverage the synergy between green's mana acceleration and blue's card advantage to maintain a consistent stream of threats. The key strategy is to apply pressure early and continuously to force opponents on the back foot, while also having answers to control decks or removal spells."
