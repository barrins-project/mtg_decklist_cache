The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push while setting up your combo pieces. By utilizing cards that allow you to discard and draw, as well as fetch lands to help with mana fixing, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures like Archon of Cruelty and Emperor of Bones to secure victory."
