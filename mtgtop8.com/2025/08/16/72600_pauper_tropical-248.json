By combining low-cost creatures like Voldaren Epicure and Sneaky Snacker with potent burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fiery Temper, the Rakdos Aggro archetype aims to apply constant pressure and finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. Additionally, cards like Faithless Looting and Grab the Prize help maintain card advantage and flexibility in gameplay. The overall strategy is to consistently chip away at the opponent's life total and secure a swift victory."
