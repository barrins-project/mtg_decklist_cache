The key strategy involves generating enough mana to play Primeval Titan and trigger its powerful abilities to overwhelm opponents. The combination of ramp spells like Arboreal Grazer and Explore, along with lands like Lotus Field and Crumbling Vestige, allows the deck to set up explosive plays and quickly close out games."
