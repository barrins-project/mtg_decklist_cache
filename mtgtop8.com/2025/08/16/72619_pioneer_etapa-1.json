By utilizing cards like Hateful Eidolon and Sram, Senior Edificer to draw more cards and Ethereal Armor to boost the creatures' power, the deck aims to deal significant damage early in the game. The inclusion of cards like Thoughtseize and Duress also allows for disruption of the opponent's strategy, while protective cards like Selfless Savior and Skrelv, Defector Mite help to ensure the creatures stay on the board."
