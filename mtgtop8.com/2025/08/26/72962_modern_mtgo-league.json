The deck aims to maintain a strong board presence with powerful creatures like Murktide Regent and Orcish Bowmasters, while also drawing cards and filtering through the deck with cards like Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student and Quantum Riddler. The inclusion of powerful threats like Subtlety and Stern Scolding allows the deck to quickly close out the game once it has gained control."
