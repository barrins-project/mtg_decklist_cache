The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells like Collected Company to maintain tempo advantage. The inclusion of cards like Bishop of Wings and Righteous Valkyrie also provides a bonus for gaining life, adding another layer of synergy to the deck's strategy."
