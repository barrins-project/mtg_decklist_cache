By utilizing aggressive creatures like Voldaren Epicure and Goblin Tomb Raider, along with powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, the deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent while efficiently removing threats. The inclusion of cards like Thermo-Alchemist and Experimental Synthesizer helps to deal additional damage while Clockwork Percussionist provides a way to generate extra value. The goal is to maintain a fast tempo and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
