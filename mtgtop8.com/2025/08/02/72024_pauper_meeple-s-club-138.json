By utilizing cards like Arbor Elf and Utopia Sprawl to ramp up mana, the deck aims to play powerful threats like Avenging Hunter and Annoyed Altisaur early on to pressure the opponent. Writhing Chrysalis and Eldrazi Repurposer provide additional utility and removal, while Stone Rain and Mwonvuli Acid-Moss disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the strategy revolves around applying early pressure and maintaining board control to secure a fast victory."
