The deck utilizes the UrzaTron lands to generate massive amounts of mana quickly, allowing for the early deployment of threat cards like Glaring Fleshraker and Thought-Knot Seer. With cards like Ugin, Eye of the Storms and Kozilek's Command, this deck aims to keep opponents on the back foot while maintaining board control. Warping Wail and Chalice of the Void are also included to provide additional disruption options."

It combines efficient creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Guide of Souls with powerful spells like Galvanic Discharge and Goblin Bombardment. The deck also includes a few control elements like Elegant Parlor and Thraben Charm to disrupt opponent strategies. The key strategy is to maintain a fast pace and keep pressure on opponents while using Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Haliya, Guided by Light to buff and protect creatures for maximum damage output."
