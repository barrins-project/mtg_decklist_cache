The goal is to continuously apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's strategy while also draining their life with Gray Merchant of Asphodel. Grim Bauble and Blood Fountain provide card advantage, while Cast Down and Eviscerator's Insight remove threats efficiently. Tithing Blade and Fanatical Offering can provide additional value by sacrificing creatures. The deck also includes utility lands like Bojuka Bog to disrupt graveyard strategies."
