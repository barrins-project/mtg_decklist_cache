By using cards like Blazing Shoal, Berserk, and Invigorate alongside creatures like Progenitus and Monastery Swiftspear, the player aims to overwhelm their opponent with a sudden burst of infect damage. The deck also includes protection in the form of Pact of Negation and Leyline of Resonance, as well as card selection with Once Upon a Time. This deck is designed to win quickly and decisively through its combo potential."
