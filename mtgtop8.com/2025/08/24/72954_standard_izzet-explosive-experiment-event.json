            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent quickly with aggressive creatures and burn spells. By using small, efficient creatures and powerful direct damage spells, the deck aims to reduce the opponent's life total as quickly as possible. The creatures in the deck have abilities that can help them survive longer or deal additional damage, while the burn spells provide reach and removal options. The deck's mana base is built to support the aggressive strategy by providing consistent access to red mana sources."
