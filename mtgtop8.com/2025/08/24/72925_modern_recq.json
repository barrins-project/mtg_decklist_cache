It utilizes cards like Dragon's Rage Channeler and Monastery Swiftspear to apply early pressure, while Lightning Bolt and Unholy Heat provide direct damage to finish off the opponent. The deck also includes cantrips like Mishra's Bauble, Preordain, and Expressive Iteration to maintain card advantage and find key pieces. The mana base is optimized for consistency and allows for easy access to both red and blue spells."
