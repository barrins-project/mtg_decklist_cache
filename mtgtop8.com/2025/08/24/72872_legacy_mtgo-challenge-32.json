It also includes disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Daze to protect the combo. Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student helps dig for combo pieces, while cards like Brainstorm and Ponder provide card selection. The deck runs a low land count with dual lands to ensure consistency and includes counterspells like Force of Will to protect the combo. Overall, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures."
