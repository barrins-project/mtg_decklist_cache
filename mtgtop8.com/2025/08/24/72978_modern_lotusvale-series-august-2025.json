By using cards like Chord of Calling and Birthing Ritual to search for specific creatures, the deck aims to assemble powerful combinations that can control the board and overwhelm the opponent. With a mix of sacrifice outlets, recursion, and efficient creatures, the deck can adapt to various situations and outvalue the opponent. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the diverse range of creature types and abilities in the deck."
