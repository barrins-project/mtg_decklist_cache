It aims to ramp up with mana acceleration, tutor for important pieces with Urza's Saga, and protect its game plan with Defense Grid. The deck's end goal is to assemble a powerful board state with Urza's Tower and Karn, the Great Creator, while using Planar Nexus and Kozilek's Command to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The primary win condition is to overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence and efficient card advantage."
