The deck focuses on efficiently using low cost creatures like Sunspine Lynx and Hired Claw to chip away at the opponent's life total while also employing direct damage spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike to finish off the opponent or remove threats. Nova Hellkite and Obliterating Bolt serve as powerful finishers to seal the game. The mana base is streamlined to ensure consistency and speed in executing the game plan."
