Metallic Rebuke and Portable Hole offer interaction and disruption, allowing the deck to maintain pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Mox Opal and Mox Amber enable explosive starts, while Thoughtcast and Mishra's Bauble provide additional card draw. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive artifact-based strategy."

It aims to delay the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Force of Negation and Kozilek's Command, while also utilizing cards like Subtlety and Propaganda to protect itself. The main win conditions are Emrakul, the Promised End and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, backed up by cards like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Ugin, Eye of the Storms. The deck's key strategy is to control the board and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful late-game threats."
