By using cards like Lotus Bloom and Whir of Invention, the deck can quickly assemble the necessary pieces to activate Goblin Charbelcher for a game-winning burst of damage. The deck also features disruptive elements like Disrupting Shoal and Force of Negation to control the game and protect its combo. The combination of efficient threats and disruptive elements makes this deck a formidable opponent in Modern 1 vs 1 gameplay."
