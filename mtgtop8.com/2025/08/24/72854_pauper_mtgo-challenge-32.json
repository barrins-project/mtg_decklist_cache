The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of powerful creatures and graveyard recursion to secure victory in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."

Cards like Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery provide additional damage potential, while Faithless Looting helps with card selection. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast-paced and aggressive playstyle."
