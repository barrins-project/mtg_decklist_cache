It uses cards like Entomb and Reanimate to put creatures like Archon of Cruelty and Murktide Regent into the graveyard, while also utilizing counterspells like Force of Will and Daze to protect the combo. Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student provides card advantage and filtering, while cards like Brazen Borrower can provide tempo plays. The goal is to efficiently reanimate big threats and overwhelm the opponent before they can respond."
