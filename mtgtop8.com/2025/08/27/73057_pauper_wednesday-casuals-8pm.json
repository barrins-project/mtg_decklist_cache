This aggressive strategy aims to quickly build a strong board presence and push through damage before the opponent can mount a defense. The inclusion of protection spells and combat tricks adds to the resilience of the creatures, allowing them to survive removal spells and win combat exchanges. The deck relies on speed and synergy to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent."
