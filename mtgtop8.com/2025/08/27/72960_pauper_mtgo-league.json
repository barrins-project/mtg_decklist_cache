It also aims to close out the game with powerful finishers like Crypt Rats and Avenging Hunter. Overall, the deck prioritizes resource management and board control to outlast opponents."

The mana base is built around artifact lands and Bridges to support the Affinity mechanic and enable quick deployment of threats. The deck's goal is to apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game."
