Ephemerate can protect key creatures from removal spells, while Ram Through and Vines of Vastwood provide removal and combat tricks. The aggressive strategy is supported by Avenging Hunter and Jewel Thief for additional damage output, creating a fast-paced and powerful deck aimed at overwhelming opponents quickly."
