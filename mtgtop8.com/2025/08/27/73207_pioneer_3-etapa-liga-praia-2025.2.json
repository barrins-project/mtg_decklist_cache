The deck focuses on generating devotion to green with cards like Nylea, Keen-Eyed and Tyvar, the Pummeler to empower its abilities and spells, while also utilizing key cards like Storm the Festival and In Search of Greatness to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent with aggressive creatures like Old-Growth Troll and Ulvenwald Oddity."
