            "notes": "This deck focuses on fast and aggressive tactics using creatures with strong abilities to overwhelm the opponent. It utilizes a mix of creature removal, card draw, and graveyard manipulation to maintain board control. The key strategy is to play aggressively, using cards like Tragic Trajectory and Shoot the Sheriff to remove threats while building up card advantage with Enduring Curiosity and Soulstone Sanctuary. With cards like Floodpits Drowner and Gloomlake Verge providing additional support, the goal is to quickly close out the game before the opponent can establish a strong defense."
