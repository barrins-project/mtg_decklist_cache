The deck utilizes a combination of powerful creatures like Solitude and Overlord of the Balemurk, along with disruptive spells like Fatal Push and Thoughtseize to control the board and create openings for attacks. The inclusion of cards like Ephemerate and Flickerwisp allows for additional value by reusing enter-the-battlefield effects and disrupting the opponent's plays."
