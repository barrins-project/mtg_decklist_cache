The strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with big threats like Griselbrand and Archon of Cruelty while disrupting their plans with cards like Thoughtseize and Unmask. The inclusion of cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Brazen Borrower provide additional utility and protection against graveyard hate or problematic permanents. The goal is to quickly assemble the combo pieces and take control of the game before the opponent can respond effectively."
