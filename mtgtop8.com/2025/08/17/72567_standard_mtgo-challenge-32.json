The deck lacks defense, but makes up for it with sheer speed and aggression. It is all about applying constant pressure and forcing the opponent to react to the onslaught."

This strategy is focused on maintaining board control and tempo, ultimately overwhelming the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The key to success lies in efficiently utilizing resources and making timely plays to keep the pressure on."
