The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's hand with cards like Duress and Thoughtseize while generating mana efficiently with cards like Chrome Mox and Dark Ritual. Wishclaw Talisman is used to tutor for key combo pieces, while cards like Infernal Tutor and Burning Wish provide additional ways to search for win conditions. Overall, the deck relies on fast mana and efficient card selection to execute its combo strategy."
