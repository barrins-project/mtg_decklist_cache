Additionally, cards like Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery provide additional ways to deal damage and gain advantage. With a streamlined focus on quick aggression, this deck aims to win before the opponent can mount a defense."

Additionally, card draw spells like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain help the player find key cards while cards like Murmuring Mystic provide a win condition.
