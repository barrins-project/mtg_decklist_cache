The deck includes various cantrips and card draw spells to find necessary combo pieces quickly. The goal is to eventually cast a large card draw spell like Ideas Unbound or Pieces of the Puzzle to find the combo pieces needed to win the game. The deck also utilizes spells like Compulsive Research and Merchant Scroll to further increase card advantage and consistency."
