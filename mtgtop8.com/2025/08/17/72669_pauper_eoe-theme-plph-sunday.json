By using low-cost creatures such as Faeries and Ninjas, along with counterspells and bounce effects to disrupt the opponent's strategy, the deck aims to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total and win the game before they can stabilize. The deck's strength lies in its ability to apply early pressure and maintain a consistent tempo throughout the game."
