The inclusion of Dreadhorde Arcanist allows for reusing spells from the graveyard, while Treasure Cruise helps to refill the hand. The mana base is carefully selected to ensure consistent access to both colors of mana needed for the deck's spells."

The inclusion of creatures with abilities like haste and prowess, such as Emberheart Challenger and Soul-Scar Mage, allows for additional combat tricks and direct damage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and relentless assault."
