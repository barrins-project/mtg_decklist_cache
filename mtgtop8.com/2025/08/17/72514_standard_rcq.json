The deck's versatile land base allows for consistent mana fixing to support its control strategy."

Cards like Riverpyre Verge and Fear of Missing Out help generate advantage while aggressive creatures like Vivi Ornitier and Greasewrench Goblin deal damage efficiently. Control elements like Into the Flood Maw and Tersa Lightshatter can disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, card draw and recursion provided by Soulstone Sanctuary, Proft's Eidetic Memory, and Winternight Stories allow for continuous aggression and adaptation to different situations. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent by utilizing a mix of aggression and control."

By utilizing cards that provide card advantage and powerful creatures with abilities that can disrupt the opponent's game plan, it seeks to establish a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure throughout the game. The inclusion of mana-producing creatures and lands helps to ensure that the deck can efficiently cast its spells and keep up the pressure on the opponent."
