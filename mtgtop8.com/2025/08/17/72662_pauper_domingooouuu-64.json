By playing low-cost creatures like Goblin Bushwhacker and Goblin Tomb Raider, along with efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent. The addition of cards like Reckless Impulse and Rally at the Hornburg allows for card draw and creature buffs, keeping the aggression going. The goal is to quickly deplete the opponent's life total before they have a chance to stabilize."
