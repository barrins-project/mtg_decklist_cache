By using cards like Day of Judgment and Get Lost to remove threats from the opponent's side of the battlefield, while also utilizing Consult the Star Charts and Meticulous Archive to draw into more powerful spells, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and establish board dominance. Key creatures like Marang River Regent and Overlord of the Mistmoors provide additional control options, while Pinnacle Starcage and Stock Up offer protection and utility. Overall, the deck aims to stall the game and eventually overpower the opponent with its control elements."
