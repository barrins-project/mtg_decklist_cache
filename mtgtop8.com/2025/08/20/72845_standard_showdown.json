By playing aggressively with cards like Azure Beastbinder and Floodpits Drowner, while also utilizing control elements such as Spyglass Siren and Phantom Interference, this deck aims to apply pressure early on and maintain tempo throughout the game. The inclusion of cards like Harvester of Misery and Tragic Trajectory provides additional removal options, while cards like Enduring Curiosity and Bitter Triumph offer card advantage and flexibility. Overall, this deck focuses on fast, efficient aggression with a touch of disruption to outpace the opponent."
