The deck also utilizes card draw and manipulation to maintain consistency and adapt to the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck aims to quickly close out the game while staying ahead in tempo and card advantage."

The deck aims to assemble a powerful storm combo using cards like Infernal Tutor and Ad Nauseam to find win conditions like Tendrils of Agony or Burning Wish. The inclusion of Wishclaw Talisman and Vault of Whispers allows for additional tutoring and ramp. The deck also utilizes cards like Lion's Eye Diamond and Cabal Ritual to generate more mana for explosive plays. The deck is designed to create a powerful storm win condition and overwhelm the opponent before they can effectively respond."
