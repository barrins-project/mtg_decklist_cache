The key strategy is to disrupt opponent's plans with counterspells like Counterspell and Spell Pierce, remove threats with Lightning Bolt and Skred, and generate tokens with Murmuring Mystic. The deck also includes card draw spells like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain to ensure consistency. The mana base consists of Snow-Covered Islands and Mountains along with Volatile Fjord and Perilous Landscape to provide mana fixing and ramp."
