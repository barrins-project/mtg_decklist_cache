The combo involves generating infinite mana with Freed from the Real on Galvanic Alchemist, allowing for a win condition with Bloodrite Invoker or Reaping the Graves to bring back key combo pieces. The deck also utilizes creature tutors like Drift of Phantasms to find combo pieces and Lead the Stampede to refill the hand with creatures."
