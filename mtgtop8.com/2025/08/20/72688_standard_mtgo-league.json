By efficiently managing resources and using cards like Opt and Consult the Star Charts to dig for threats, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a mix of burn and creature pressure. Utilizing tempo advantage and efficient spells, the deck looks to quickly close out games before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Artist's Talent and Proft's Eidetic Memory provide additional reach and tools for card advantage in longer matches."
