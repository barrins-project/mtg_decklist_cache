The deck aims to stabilize the board, answer threats efficiently, and outvalue the opponent in the long run by leveraging the powerful card draw and manipulation spells like Brainstorm and Ponder. With a mix of counterspells, removal, and card advantage engines, the deck seeks to outmaneuver the opponent and grind out a victory through attrition."
