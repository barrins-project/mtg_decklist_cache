The inclusion of discard spells like Faithless Looting and removal like Chain Lightning helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Grab the Prize provide additional reach and card advantage. The mana base and land choices are designed to support the aggressive strategy by providing consistent access to both red and black mana sources."

The deck also includes cards like Faithless Looting and Grab the Prize to maintain card advantage and ensure consistency in the aggro gameplan."
