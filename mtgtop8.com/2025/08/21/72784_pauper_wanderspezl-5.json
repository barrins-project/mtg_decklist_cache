By efficiently utilizing card draw and graveyard synergy, the deck aims to consistently apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining card advantage. The inclusion of cards like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent allows for a fast clock, while spells like Counterspell and Dispel help protect the board state and ensure the opponent has a difficult time stabilizing."
