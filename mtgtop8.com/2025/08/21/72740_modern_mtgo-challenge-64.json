Once there are enough creatures in the graveyard, the player can cast Living End to reanimate all of their creatures at once, overwhelming the opponent. Cards like Subtlety and Force of Negation provide protection and disruption, while Curator of Mysteries and Waker of Waves offer additional value. The deck aims to win by setting up a powerful board state with a single well-timed Living End."
