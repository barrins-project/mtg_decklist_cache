It utilizes cantrips and card draw spells to dig for key combo pieces while also including countermagic and disruption to protect the combo. The goal is to efficiently cast multiple spells in a turn to generate enough mana to go off with a big finish, overwhelming the opponent before they have a chance to respond."
