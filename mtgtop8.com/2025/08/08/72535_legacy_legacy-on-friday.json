The deck also runs a suite of utility lands like Bojuka Bog and Karakas to disrupt opponents' strategies. Additionally, it includes ways to slow down opponents with cards like Sphere of Resistance and Wasteland, making it difficult for them to execute their game plan effectively."

Nethergoyf and Kaito, Bane of Nightmares provide additional ways to close out the game quickly, while cards like Fatal Push and Daze keep your opponent on the back foot. Wasteland and Orcish Bowmasters also help to disrupt your opponent's mana base, giving you the advantage."
