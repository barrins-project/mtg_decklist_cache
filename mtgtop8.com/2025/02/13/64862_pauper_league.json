By playing efficient creatures like Thraben Inspector and Kor Skyfisher, combined with removal spells like Cast Down and Snuff Out, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while developing its own board presence. The inclusion of cards like Ephemerate and Omen of the Dead allows for recursion and card advantage, giving the deck an edge in longer games. Overall, the deck seeks to out-tempo the opponent and win through aggressive creature combat."
