Once Omniscience is in play, the deck aims to cast spells for free, using cards like Ephara's Dispersal and Confounding Riddle to control the board while drawing cards and setting up for a game-winning turn. The deck also includes disruption and card draw spells to help find pieces of the combo and protect the key combo pieces."
