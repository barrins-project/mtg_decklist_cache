By sacrificing creatures through cards like Cabal Therapy and Dread Return, the deck can generate a large number of zombie tokens with Bridge from Below. This enables the player to set up a game-winning combo with cards like Thassa's Oracle or Ox of Agonas. The deck also includes disruption elements like Poxwalkers and Otherworldly Gaze to control the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck focuses on utilizing graveyard interactions to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."
