Cards like Raise the Past and Vengeful Bloodwitch help to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent. The deck's mana base is streamlined with Caves of Koilos and Concealed Courtyard, allowing for consistent aggression. The goal is to curve out efficiently and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
