By sacrificing creatures and artifacts with effects like Deadly Dispute and Ichor Wellspring, players can create a loop that allows them to continuously pump a creature with Sadistic Glee, dealing massive damage to the opponent. The deck also includes protection in the form of Tamiyo's Safekeeping and removal spells like Malevolent Rumble. The key strategy is to set up the combo pieces while controlling the board, then unleash a lethal attack with Sadistic Glee."
