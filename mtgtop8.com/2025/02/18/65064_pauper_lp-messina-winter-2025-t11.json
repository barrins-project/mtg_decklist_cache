It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up for powerful late-game plays with cards like Gurmag Angler. It employs a mix of cheap spells and efficient creatures to apply pressure while maintaining control of the battlefield. Strategic use of card draw and filtering effects like Careful Study and Thought Scour help ensure consistent access to the right cards at the right time. Land choices support the deck's game plan by providing flexible mana options."
