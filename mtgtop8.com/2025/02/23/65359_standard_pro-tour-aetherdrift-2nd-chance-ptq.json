Confounding Riddle and Temporary Lockdown are used as disruption against opponents. Chart a Course and Stock Up help with card draw and deck manipulation. Invasion of Arcavios provides additional spell options. Blast Zone serves as removal, while the mana base includes lands that provide both colors needed for the combo."

Additionally, the mana base is designed to support the aggressive playstyle with a focus on Mountains for quick and consistent access to red mana."

Sheoldred, the Apocalypse serves as a game-ending threat, while Obstinate Baloth and Sentinel of the Nameless City provide additional pressure. The mana base ensures consistent access to both green and black mana sources."

These cards help to get Omniscience onto the battlefield as soon as possible, allowing the player to cast spells for free. Other cards like Ephara's Dispersal and Confounding Riddle help to control the board while setting up the combo. The deck also includes cards like Temporary Lockdown and Invasion of Arcavios to further disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base is designed to support the combo while providing consistency."

The strategy revolves around stalling the opponent's threats, disrupting their game plan, and ultimately outlasting them with powerful late-game cards like Jace, the Perfected Mind and Horned Loch-Whale. By efficiently managing resources and controlling the board, this deck aims to establish dominance and win through attrition. Card draw and mana ramp are crucial to ensure the deck can consistently answer threats and maintain control throughout the match."
