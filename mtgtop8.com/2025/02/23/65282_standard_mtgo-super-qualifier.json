With cards like Manifold Mouse and Rockface Village providing additional support, the deck creates a fast-paced, high pressure game plan designed to secure victory before the opponent can get their own strategy online."

The deck also includes cards like Monstrous Rage to pump up its creatures and push for lethal damage. Overall, the deck aims to play aggressively and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
