The deck aims to apply early pressure and finish the game with powerful creatures like Nyxborn Hydra and Lembas, while using cards like Cleasing Wildfire and Ichor Wellspring to control the board and generate card advantage. Additionally, Snuff Out and Unholy Heat provide additional removal options to keep the opponent on the back foot."
