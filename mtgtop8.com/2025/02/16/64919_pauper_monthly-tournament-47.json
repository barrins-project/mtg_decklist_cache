            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with small, efficient creatures known as \"weenies\" and support them with various spells that enhance their abilities. By quickly amassing a board of creatures and utilizing cards like Prismatic Strands for protection, the deck aims to establish early dominance and pressure the opponent into making unfavorable decisions. The synergy between creatures like Martyr's Soul and spells like Guardians' Pledge allows for powerful attacks that can quickly end the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
