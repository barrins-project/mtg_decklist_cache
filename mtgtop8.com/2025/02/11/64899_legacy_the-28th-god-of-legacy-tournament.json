Once these creatures are in the graveyard, the player can bring them back onto the battlefield using cards like Reanimate and Animate Dead. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Brazen Borrower and Force of Will to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base is designed to provide a good mix of colored mana sources and disruption through Wasteland and Undercity Sewers."

The combination of cheap interaction spells like Force of Will and Daze, along with disruptive creatures like Dauthi Voidwalker, allows the deck to protect its game plan while disrupting the opponent. The deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Archon of Cruelty and Atraxa, Grand Unifier, making it difficult for the opponent to keep up with the sheer speed and efficiency of the combo strategy."
