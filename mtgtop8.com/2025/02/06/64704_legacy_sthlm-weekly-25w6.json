            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively play powerful creatures and disrupt opponents' strategies by limiting their resources. By using cards like Chalice of the Void, Magus of the Moon, and Archon of Emeria, the deck aims to control the tempo of the game and quickly overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of fast mana like Chrome Mox and Lotus Petal allows for explosive starts, while cards like Solitude provide removal options. The deck seeks to take control of the game early on and maintain pressure until victory is achieved."
