By utilizing aggressive creatures like Goblin Bushwhacker and Voldaren Epicure, along with burn spells such as Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to deal damage to the opponent as fast as possible. Supporting cards like Kuldotha Rebirth and Experimental Synthesizer help keep up the pressure, while cards like Chain Lightning and Fireblast provide additional reach to finish off the opponent. The mana base is streamlined with Great Furnace and Mountain to ensure consistent and fast starts."
