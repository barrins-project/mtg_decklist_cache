By curving out early with creatures like Bloodtithe Harvester and Bonecrusher Giant, while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Duress, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent and close out the game quickly. The inclusion of cards like Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and Fear of Missing Out add additional threats and card advantage to help maintain tempo and outvalue the opponent. Additionally, cards like Fatal Push and Invoke Despair provide removal options to clear the way for attacks."
