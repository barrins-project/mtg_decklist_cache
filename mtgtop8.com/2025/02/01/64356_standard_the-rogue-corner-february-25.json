The strategy involves playing low-cost creatures with evasion like Elas il-Kor and Deep-Cavern Bat, supported by cards like Amalia Benavides Aguirre and Picklock Prankster to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes removal spells like Hinterland Sanctifier and Raise the Past to deal with threats. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent and finish the game quickly before they have a chance to stabilize."
