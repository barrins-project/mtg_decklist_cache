The key strategy involves gaining incremental advantages over time by using cards like Authority of the Consuls and Season of the Burrow to slow down the opponent's progress. Additionally, the deck contains various removal spells like Get Lost and Seized from Slumber to deal with threats on the board. The creatures in the deck, such as Overlord of the Mistmoors and Beza, the Bounding Spring, provide additional control and defensive capabilities to maintain board presence. With the right mix of control and defense, this deck aims to outlast the opponent and secure victory."
