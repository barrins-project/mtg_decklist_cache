It utilizes control cards like Kozilek's Command and Malevolent Rumble to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also generating value through cards like Sowing Mycospawn and Karn, the Great Creator. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with huge threats and disrupt their strategy, ultimately leading to victory through sheer power and control."
