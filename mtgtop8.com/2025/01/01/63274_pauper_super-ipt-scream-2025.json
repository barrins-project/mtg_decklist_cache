By combining aggressive creatures like Myr Enforcer and Gearseeker Serpent with cards like Deadly Dispute and Reckoner's Bargain, the deck can overwhelm opponents while drawing additional resources. The inclusion of artifact lands and cards like Blood Fountain allows for additional synergies with the deck's artifact theme. The goal is to establish a strong board presence early and maintain pressure on opponents throughout the game."
