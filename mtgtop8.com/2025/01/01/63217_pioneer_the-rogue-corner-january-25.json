The key strategy is to accelerate mana production using cards like Arboreal Grazer and Gilded Goose, while also using control cards like Dreamdew Entrancer and Insidious Fungus to slow down the opponent. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Sire of Seven Deaths to seal the deal. Additionally, the deck includes flexible cards like Glasspool Mimic and Spelunking to adapt to different game situations."
