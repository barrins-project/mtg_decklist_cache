Kiora, the Rising Tide provides card advantage and tempo manipulation, while cards like Torch the Tower and Unsummon offer disruption against the opponent. The mana base is streamlined to ensure consistent access to both colors, with a few utility lands like Soulstone Sanctuary for additional benefits. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain momentum throughout the game."
