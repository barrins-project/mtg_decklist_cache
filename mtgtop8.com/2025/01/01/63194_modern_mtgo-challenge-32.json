By using mana ramp cards like Utopia Sprawl and Talismans, the deck aims to cast large threats like Emrakul, the Promised End and World Breaker ahead of the curve. The Eldrazi creatures in the deck also provide additional value with their abilities, while spells like Kozilek's Command and Ancient Stirrings help maintain control and card advantage. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with eldritch horrors and outvalue them in the late game."

By efficiently removing threats from the opponent's board, countering key spells, and constantly drawing cards, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent. With a mix of tempo plays and powerful finishers like Murktide Regent and Graveyard Trespasser, the deck seeks to disrupt the opponent's game plan while steadily building towards a winning position. The deck's win condition is to establish a dominant board presence and close out the game with powerful threats."
