The deck also includes cards like Collector's Cage and Get Lost to disrupt the opponent's strategy, while utilizing Toby, Beastie Befriender and Overlord of the Mistmoors for additional support and card advantage. With a mix of efficient creatures and supportive spells, this deck aims to establish board dominance and finish the game quickly."
