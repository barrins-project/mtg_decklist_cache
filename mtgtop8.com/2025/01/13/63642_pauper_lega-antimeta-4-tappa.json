By utilizing cards like Eldrazi Repurposer, Nyxborn Hydra, and Werebear, you can quickly establish a formidable board presence. The inclusion of cards like Jewel Thief and Vault Skirge ensures that you have additional threats to apply pressure to your opponent. Malevolent Rumble and Rancor provide additional ways to pump up your creatures and push through damage. The deck also includes ramp elements like Llanowar Visionary and Wild Growth to accelerate your game plan."
