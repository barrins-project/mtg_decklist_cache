The deck aims to maintain board control and outvalue the opponent by efficiently dealing with threats and deploying evasive creatures for chip damage. The Faerie tribal synergy with Spellstutter Sprite and Faerie Seer adds an additional layer of disruption, making it difficult for opponents to resolve spells. The deck's mana base allows for consistent access to both blue and black mana sources for casting spells and activating abilities."
