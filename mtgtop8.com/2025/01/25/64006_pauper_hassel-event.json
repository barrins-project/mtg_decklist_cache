Crypt Rats and Defile provide additional board control, while cards like Avenging Hunter and Troll of Khazad-dûm serve as win conditions.

It also aims to control the board with removal spells like Cast Down and Snuff Out, while generating card advantage with Ichor Wellspring and Blood Fountain. The deck's mana base is designed to enable the aggressive playstyle with a mix of lands and artifacts. Overall, this deck is built around sacrificing, generating value, and maintaining board control to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive threats."
