The deck utilizes a mix of efficient counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining card advantage. The inclusion of snow-covered lands allows for synergy with cards like Skred and Lórien Revealed. The goal is to outvalue the opponent while controlling the board and eventually closing out the game with a finisher like Azure Fleet Admiral or Murmuring Mystic."
