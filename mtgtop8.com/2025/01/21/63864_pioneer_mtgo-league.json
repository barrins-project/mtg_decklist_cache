This devotion to green allows for powerful plays with cards like Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Polukranos Reborn. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with aggressive creatures like Rhonas the Indomitable and Spinner of Souls, while also disrupting their strategy with cards like Hunter's Talent and Collected Company. The inclusion of Lair of the Hydra and Boseiju, Who Endures provide additional versatility and protection."
