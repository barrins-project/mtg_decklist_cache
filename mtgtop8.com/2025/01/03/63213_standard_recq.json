Protection spells like Sheltered by Ghosts and Shardmage's Rescue help keep your creatures alive while maintaining pressure. The inclusion of Mabel, Heir to Cragflame adds a powerful late-game threat. This deck aims to win the game as swiftly as possible through aggressive attacks and direct damage."

The deck also includes removal spells like Go for the Throat and Cut Down to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the focus is on applying pressure and maintaining tempo to secure a victory."

By consistently answering threats and drawing cards, the deck seeks to outvalue the opponent and eventually win the game through its powerful finishers like Chandra, Hope's Beacon and Thundertrap Trainer."
