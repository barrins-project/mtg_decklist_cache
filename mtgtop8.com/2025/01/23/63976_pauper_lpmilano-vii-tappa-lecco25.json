Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Thoughtcast allows for graveyard disruption and card draw, respectively.

The deck aims to outlast the opponent by recurring key cards like Pulse of Murasa and Nihil Spellbomb, while also presenting threats in the form of creatures like Nyxborn Hydra and Troll of Khazad-dûm. The mana base includes a combination of lands that provide color fixing and token generation to ensure the deck can consistently cast its spells and maintain board presence."
