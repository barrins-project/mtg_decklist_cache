This deck aims to close out the game as quickly as possible by utilizing efficient creatures like Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd and Overlord of the Balemurk. The inclusion of Goblin Bombardment provides additional reach and removal options. Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury provide additional aggression and synergy with the deck's strategy. The mana base is carefully designed to ensure consistent mana production for the deck's aggressive game plan."
