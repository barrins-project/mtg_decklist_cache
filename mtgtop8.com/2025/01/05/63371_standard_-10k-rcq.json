The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient creatures and finish them off with direct damage spells. The deck also includes cards that provide additional damage and card draw to keep up the pressure on the opponent. It aims to win the game quickly by putting pressure on the opponent and not giving them enough time to stabilize."

Using cards like Invasion of Arcavios, Chart a Course, and Abuelo's Awakening, the player can set up their hand and battlefield to take advantage of Omniscience. With a mix of card draw, removal, and counterspells, the deck aims to stall the opponent's strategy while building up to a game-winning play with Omniscience and powerful spells."

The deck aims to constantly disrupt the opponent's strategy while building card advantage with Beseech the Mirror and Dreams of Steel and Oil. The win condition comes from playing Demonic Pact and then passing it to the opponent through Harmless Offering, eventually leading to their demise. Sheoldred, the Apocalypse provides additional late-game value, while Preacher of the Schism can help finish off the opponent. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and provide consistent access to all the spells."
