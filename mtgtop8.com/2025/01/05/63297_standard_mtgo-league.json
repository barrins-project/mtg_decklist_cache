By utilizing cards like Deadly Cover-Up, Go for the Throat, and Maelstrom Pulse for removal, along with Herd Migration for token generation, the deck can maintain board control. The deck also includes powerful cards like Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and Vivien Reid for additional value. The mana base includes a mix of dual lands and utility lands to support the deck's strategy."
