By playing efficiently-costed threats like Entity Tracker and Nurturing Pixie, along with removal spells like Go for the Throat, the deck aims to maintain board control and apply pressure to the opponent. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Hopeless Nightmare and Stormchaser's Talent allow for card advantage and additional ways to close out the game. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure smooth gameplay and consistent access to all colors needed for the deck's strategy."
