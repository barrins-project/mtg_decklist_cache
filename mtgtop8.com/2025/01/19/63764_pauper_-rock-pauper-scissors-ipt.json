By constantly pressuring the opponent with aggressive creatures like Nyxborn Hydra and Krark-Clan Shaman, while also disrupting their plans with cards like Cleansing Wildfire and Nihil Spellbomb, you aim to control the game and come out ahead. Additionally, the deck features card draw and recursion options to ensure you maintain a steady stream of threats and answers. Overall, the strategy revolves around maintaining a proactive game plan while disrupting the opponent's strategy."
