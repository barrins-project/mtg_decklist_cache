By using cards like Distorted Curiosity and Whisper of the Dross to draw cards and generate value, while also utilizing powerful control spells like Serum Snare and Drown in Ichor to deal with threats efficiently, this deck aims to stall the game out and eventually overwhelm the opponent with its late-game finishers like Venerated Rotpriest and Bring the Ending. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements while ensuring consistency in casting spells."
