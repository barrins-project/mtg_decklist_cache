By combining efficient creature threats with powerful artifact cards such as Chalice of the Void and Urza's Saga, the deck aims to disrupt opponents while applying pressure on the board. The inclusion of cards like Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Mishra's Bauble allows for card advantage and recursion, ensuring a consistent and proactive game plan. The deck's reliance on artifacts and disruptive spells like Force of Will makes it a versatile and formidable archetype in the Legacy 1 vs 1 format."

The key strategy revolves around playing cards like Chrome Mox and Simian Spirit Guide to ramp out powerful threats like Karn, the Great Creator and Magus of the Moon early in the game. By establishing an aggressive board presence and disrupting the opponent's mana base with cards like Chalice of the Void and City of Traitors, this deck aims to secure an early advantage and close out the game swiftly."
