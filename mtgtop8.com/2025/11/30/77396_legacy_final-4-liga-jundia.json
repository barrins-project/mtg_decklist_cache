The deck also includes cards like Lotus Petal and Lion's Eye Diamond to generate mana quickly and cards like Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student and Thassa's Oracle to provide additional value and alternate win conditions. The goal is to assemble the Doomsday combo as quickly and consistently as possible while disrupting opponents' game plan."
