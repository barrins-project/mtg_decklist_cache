The Gates provide additional utility by tapping for multiple colors of mana and preventing damage with Prismatic Strands.

It utilizes efficient creatures like Burning-Tree Emissary and Goblin Bushwhacker to quickly build a board presence, while also using burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt to remove blockers or finish off opponents. The deck can also take advantage of sacrificing creatures with Fireblast and Reckless Abandon for extra damage. Rally at the Hornburg can provide a large boost to the team's attacks, allowing for a swift victory."
