The deck also includes disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a combination of graveyard manipulation, reanimation spells, and disruption, this deck aims to create explosive plays and overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures early in the game."
