            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to create a fast and aggressive strategy with creatures that can quickly overwhelm the opponent. By utilizing mana ramp with cards like Arbor Elf and Utopia Sprawl, the deck aims to play large threats like Nyxborn Hydra and Bannerhide Krushok early in the game. The inclusion of removal spells like Ram Through and Malevolent Rumble helps to clear the way for these powerful creatures to deal massive damage to the opponent. Overall, the deck focuses on efficiently playing threats and disrupting the opponent's game plan."
