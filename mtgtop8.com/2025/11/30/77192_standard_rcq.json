By using cards like Jeskai Revelation, Deadly Cover-Up, and Inevitable Defeat, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and outvalue them in the long game. Additionally, with access to powerful removal spells like Lightning Helix and Shiko, Paragon of the Way, the deck can deal with threats efficiently. The mana base is optimized for consistent color access to enable the player to cast their spells effectively."
