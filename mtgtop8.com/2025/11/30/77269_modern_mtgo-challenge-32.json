It also includes disruption in the form of counterspells like Flare of Denial and Force of Negation, as well as removal with Dismember. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and control, leveraging card advantage and tempo to maintain a strong board presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
