By utilizing cards like Birchlore Rangers and Priest of Titania to ramp up mana production, along with cards like Timberwatch Elf to pump up the team, the deck aims to swarm the opponent with aggressive plays. Lead the Stampede and Distant Melody help refill the hand with more creatures, while cards like Wellwisher provide some sustain. Overall, the deck aims to flood the board early and maintain pressure throughout the game."
