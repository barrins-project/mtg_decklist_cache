Additionally, there are cards included to disrupt the opponent's strategy and control the board. The goal is to outlast the opponent and assemble the necessary pieces to secure victory."

This combo allows you to win the game by immediately following up with Dread Return and bringing Lotleth Giant back from the graveyard to deal a significant amount of damage to the opponent. The deck also includes various creatures and spells to help ramp up mana and find combo pieces efficiently. It focuses on quickly assembling the necessary combo pieces to win the game in a single turn."
