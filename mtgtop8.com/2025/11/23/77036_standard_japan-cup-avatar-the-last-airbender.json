Additionally, cards like Doc Aurlock, Grizzled Genius and Gene Pollinator provide added value and card advantage to maintain pressure. Quantum Riddler and Aang, at the Crossroads offer additional ways to disrupt the opponent's strategy and secure victory."

By efficiently playing creatures like Badgermole Cub and Llanowar Elves, then buffing them with cards like Repulsive Mutation and Tyvar, the Pummeler, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on. Spyglass Siren and Jackal, Genius Geneticist provide control options, while Gene Pollinator and Ouroboroid offer resilient threats. With a mix of efficient creatures and supportive spells, this deck aims to close out games quickly through aggressive plays and strategic decision-making."
