The deck focuses on quickly establishing a board presence with efficient creatures like Guide of Souls and Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer, then using burn spells like Galvanic Discharge and Lightning Bolt to control the board and finish off the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and Goblin Bombardment adds additional reach and versatility to the deck, allowing for multiple avenues to victory. Lastly, cards like Blood Moon and Arena of Glory provide disruption and additional advantage against certain matchups."

Mishra's Bauble and Expressive Iteration provide card advantage, while the land base ensures consistent mana sources.
