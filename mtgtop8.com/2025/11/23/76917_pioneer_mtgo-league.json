By using cards that boost the strength of multiple creatures at once and utilizing low-cost creatures with abilities that support each other, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence. Additionally, the inclusion of removal spells and protection cards helps to control the battlefield and protect key creatures. The deck's reliance on synergy and efficiency allows it to quickly build an advantage and apply pressure to the opponent in a fast-paced game."
