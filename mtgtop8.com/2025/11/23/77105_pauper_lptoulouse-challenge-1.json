By playing aggressively and flooding the battlefield with multiple creatures, the deck aims to quickly build a commanding board presence and apply pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Battle Screech, Squadron Hawk, and Thraben Inspector allows for continuous card advantage and board presence, while combat tricks like Prismatic Strands and Thraben Charm provide protection and additional combat utility. The deck aims to win through fast, efficient creature-based aggression."
