It includes cards like Crypt Rats and Malevolent Rumble for board control, Eviscerator's Insight for direct damage, and Moment's Peace for protection. The deck also includes ways to gain life and generate card advantage to outlast opponents. With careful planning and strategic plays, this deck can quickly overwhelm opponents and secure victory."
