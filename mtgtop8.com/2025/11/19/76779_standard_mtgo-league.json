The deck aims to maintain control of the board while generating card advantage through spells like Opt and Stock Up. Additionally, the deck utilizes the powerful Planeswalker Ral, Crackling Wit to generate card advantage and provide additional removal options. The various burn spells like Obliterating Bolt and Torch the Tower are used as finishers to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted."
