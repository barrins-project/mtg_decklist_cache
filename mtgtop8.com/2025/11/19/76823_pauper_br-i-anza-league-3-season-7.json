By using cards like Fanatical Offering, Ichor Wellspring, and Pulse of Murasa, the deck aims to control the board while generating card advantage and gaining life. With a mix of creature removal, hand disruption, and graveyard hate, the deck can deal with a variety of threats while slowly building up its own board presence. The deck is resilient and versatile, able to adapt to different matchups and playstyles."
