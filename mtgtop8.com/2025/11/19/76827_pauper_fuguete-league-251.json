With a low mana curve and a high level of aggression, the deck aims to close out the game as quickly as possible while keeping the opponent on the defensive. The inclusion of cards like Blightning and Okiba Reckoner Raid helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining pressure. Overall, the deck aims to be relentless in its assault and punish any slow or unprepared opponents."
