By efficiently using cards that deal direct damage, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a strong defense. Additionally, the deck includes cards that help draw more burn spells and creatures to keep up the pressure. With a strong focus on aggression and burning the opponent down as quickly as possible, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can mount a successful defense."
