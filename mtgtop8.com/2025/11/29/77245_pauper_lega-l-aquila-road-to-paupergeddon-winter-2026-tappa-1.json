By combining removal spells like Cast Down and Golgari Rot Farm with creatures like Cauldron Familiar and Troll of Khazad-dûm, the deck can outvalue opponents while disrupting their game plan. Cards like Fanatical Offering and Eviscerator's Insight provide additional removal and synergy with sacrificing creatures. The deck also includes some lifegain and card draw elements to ensure longevity in longer matches."
