With a mix of powerful creatures, mana dorks, and disruptive elements, the deck aims to establish early dominance on the battlefield and close out the game with big threats like Craterhoof Behemoth. Through efficient tutoring and strong ramp spells, the deck can consistently set up powerful board states that are difficult for opponents to overcome. Overall, the strategy revolves around leveraging the strength of Cradle and controlling the game until victory is achieved."
