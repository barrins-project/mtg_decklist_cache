It utilizes various artifact lands and card draw spells to support its strategy, as well as removal spells like Galvanic Blast and Krark-Clan Shaman to control the board. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Makeshift Munitions and Nihil Spellbomb for additional utility and synergy with its artifact theme. The key idea is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and consistent stream of threats while maintaining card advantage and disrupting the opponent's game plan."
