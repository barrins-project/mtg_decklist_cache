By using fast mana sources like Lotus Petal and Talismans, the deck aims to deploy threats ahead of schedule and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells. The Eldrazi creatures in this deck are designed to apply early pressure and control the board, allowing the pilot to secure a victory before the opponent can stabilize."

It uses various artifacts and creatures to find pieces of the combo, protect it with countermagic like Force of Will, and generate mana with cards like Mox Opal and Lotus Petal. The inclusion of Urza's Saga allows for additional tutors and artifact synergy. Emry, Lurker of the Loch provides recursion for key pieces and Thought Monitor offers card advantage. The deck focuses on speed, consistency, and disruption to win the game efficiently."
