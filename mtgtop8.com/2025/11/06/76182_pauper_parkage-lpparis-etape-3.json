It includes a mix of cantrips and card draw spells to quickly find key pieces, along with interaction like Gigadrowse to disrupt opponents. The goal is to chain together spells and generate enough mana to cast a game-winning spell or combo. Strategic sequencing of spells and careful planning are crucial to maximize the deck's potential and outpace opponents."
