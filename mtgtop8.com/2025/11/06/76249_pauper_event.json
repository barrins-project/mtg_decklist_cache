Lightning Bolt provides additional removal and reach, while Rally the Peasants can quickly close out games. Faithless Looting and Thrilling Discovery help with card draw and selection. Battle Screech generates multiple tokens, and the mana base is optimized for consistent casting. This deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and aggressive board presence."
