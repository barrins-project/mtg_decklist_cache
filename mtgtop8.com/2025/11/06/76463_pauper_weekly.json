By using cards like Duress and Nihil Spellbomb to disrupt the opponent's strategy, while also generating value through cards like Ichor Wellspring and Lembas, the player aims to establish board presence with cards like Pestilence and Cauldron Familiar. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Temporal Intervention and Cast Down to deal with threats efficiently. With a focus on generating value and controlling the board, this Golgari/Jund Garden deck aims to outlast and outplay the opponent."
