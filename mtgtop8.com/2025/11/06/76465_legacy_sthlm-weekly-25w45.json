The deck also focuses on disruption with cards like Daze and Force of Will to protect its threats. The mana base is designed to ensure consistency in casting spells early on, while cards like Mishra's Bauble and Ponder help with card selection and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to control the game tempo and overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive strategy."
