The combo involves using Freed from the Real on a creature with high toughness to generate infinite mana, allowing for powerful spell casts and potential game-winning plays. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to maintain card advantage while digging for combo pieces. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can assemble its combo for a decisive victory."
