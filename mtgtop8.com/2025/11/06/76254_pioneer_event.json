By combining aggressive creatures like Dauntless Bodyguard and Thalia's Lieutenant with powerful support cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Adeline, Resplendent Cathar, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and maintain that pressure throughout. Mutavault and Cavern of Souls provide additional utility and protection for the creature-heavy strategy."
