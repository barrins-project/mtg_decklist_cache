The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Cast Down, while also building up its own board presence with creatures like Nyxborn Hydra and Gixian Infiltrator. The inclusion of cards like Drossforge Bridge and Darkmoss Bridge helps to enable the sacrifice strategy, while cards like Pulse of Murasa provide additional recursion. Overall, the deck looks to apply pressure early while maintaining card advantage through sacrifice synergies."
