            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive Eldrazi creatures while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Chalice of the Void and Thought-Knot Seer. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent from the beginning of the game by playing powerful Eldrazi creatures early on. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Ancient Tomb and Lotus Petal to accelerate mana production and cast big threats ahead of schedule. The inclusion of cards like Wasteland and Eye of Ugin also helps to control the opponent's resources and ensure the Eldrazi creatures can dominate the battlefield."
