The inclusion of Quirion Ranger and Priest of Titania also helps generate more mana to cast more threats. The deck also utilizes creatures like Masked Vandal and Spider-Man, Brooklyn Visionary for disruption and card advantage. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way provide card draw to keep the pressure on the opponent."
