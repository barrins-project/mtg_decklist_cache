It aims to stall the game with removal spells and counter magic, then capitalizes on card draw and resource management to outvalue the opponent. By utilizing a mix of control spells, removal, and draw engines, the goal is to establish a dominant position and gradually wear down the opponent's resources until victory is assured. The inclusion of powerful creatures and game-ending spells provide additional win conditions to close out games efficiently."

By utilizing efficient creatures like Burnout Bashtronaut and Razorkin Needlehead, as well as burn spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to reduce the opponent's life total as quickly as possible. The inclusion of Nova Hellkite provides a strong late-game threat, while Witchstalker Frenzy helps to pump up the team and finish off the opponent. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive game plan, with a mix of Mountains and utility lands like Rockface Village and Soulstone Sanctuary."
