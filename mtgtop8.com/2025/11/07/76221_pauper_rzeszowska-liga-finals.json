The deck is also equipped with removal spells like Galvanic Blast and Krark-Clan Shaman to control the board and close out the game with direct damage. The synergy between artifacts and sacrifice effects creates a fast-paced and synergistic aggro strategy."

It aims to outvalue the opponent with recursion and efficient removal, eventually overwhelming them with threats such as Crypt Rats and Troll of Khazad-dûm. The deck also utilizes lands like Khalni Garden to generate token creatures for sacrificing. Overall, the strategy revolves around attrition and resource management to grind out the opponent and secure victory."
