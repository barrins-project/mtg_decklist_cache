By utilizing the affinity mechanic to reduce the costs of artifact creatures, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and aggressive strategy. Additionally, the inclusion of removal spells and counter magic helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own threats. The mana base is designed to support the color requirements of the deck while maximizing artifact synergy."
