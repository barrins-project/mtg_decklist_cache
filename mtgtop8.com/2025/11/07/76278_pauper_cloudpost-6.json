The deck aims to control the opponent's creatures and prevent them from establishing a strong board presence, while also applying pressure with cards like Murmuring Mystic and Tolarian Terror. The deck utilizes a mix of burn spells and counterspells to handle threats efficiently, while also having card selection tools like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain to ensure consistency and find key cards when needed."
