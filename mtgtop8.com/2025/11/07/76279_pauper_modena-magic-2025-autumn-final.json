The combination of cards like Gixian Infiltrator, Refurbished Familiar, and Writhing Chrysalis aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly, while cards like Cast Down and Eviscerator's Insight provide efficient removal options. Additionally, utilizing artifacts like Blood Fountain and Ichor Wellspring helps to provide card advantage and consistency. The deck also includes some graveyard hate with cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Bojuka Bog to disrupt opponent strategies."
