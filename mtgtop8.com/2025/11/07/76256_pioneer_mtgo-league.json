By utilizing cards like Foundry Street Denizen, Battle Cry Goblin, and Legion Loyalist, the aim is to build a wide board presence and deal damage to the opponent as quickly as possible. Skirk Prospector and Conspicuous Snoop provide additional utility and card advantage, while Den of the Bugbear and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx generate additional resources for the deck. With a combination of powerful creatures and efficient spells, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
