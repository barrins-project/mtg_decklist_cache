By playing multiple cheap and efficient creatures like Burning-Tree Emissary and Goblin Bushwhacker, along with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, the goal is to deal as much damage as possible in the early turns. Rally at the Hornburg and Wrenn's Resolve are included to provide additional ways to pump up creatures and push through damage, while Fireblast can serve as a potent finisher. The key strategy is to maintain pressure and end the game before the opponent can stabilize."
