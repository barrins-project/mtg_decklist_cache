The inclusion of versatile cards like Abrupt Decay and Brazen Borrower allow for flexibility in handling different threats.

By using cards like Urza's Bauble and Mishra's Bauble for card advantage and Urza's Saga for ramp, the deck aims to establish an early board presence and disruptive threats while controlling the game with counterspells like Force of Will and Metallic Rebuke. With a blend of artifact synergy and aggro tactics, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and disrupt opponent's game plans effectively."

The deck also includes disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Duress to control the opponent's hand, while also having card selection and filtering tools like Brainstorm and Ponder to find key combo pieces."
