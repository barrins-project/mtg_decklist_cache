By utilizing cards that provide mana acceleration and disruptive elements like Archon of Emeria and Swords to Plowshares, the deck aims to control the pace of the game and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. With a mix of creature threats and removal spells, the deck seeks to maintain tempo and capitalize on early advantage to secure a quick victory."
