It also includes disruptive elements like Force of Negation and Remand to protect the combo and control the game. The deck relies on card draw and selection from cards like Peek, Mishra's Bauble, and This Town Ain't Big Enough to find key pieces. The mana base includes lands like Mutavault and Cavern of Souls to support the creature-heavy strategy."
