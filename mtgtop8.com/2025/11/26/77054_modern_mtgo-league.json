It aims to create a storm of spells that can overwhelm the opponent in a single explosive turn, either burning them out with direct damage or overwhelming them with a flurry of spells. The deck also utilizes cards like Wish and Ral, Monsoon Mage to find key pieces and control the game until it can execute its combo."
