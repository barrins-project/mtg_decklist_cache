By playing efficient and evasive creatures like Faeries along with disruptive spells like Counterspell and Spell Pierce, the deck aims to control the board while pressuring the opponent's life total. The inclusion of card draw spells like Of One Mind and card advantage engines like Ninja of the Deep Hours ensures that the deck can maintain its aggression and outvalue the opponent in the long run."
