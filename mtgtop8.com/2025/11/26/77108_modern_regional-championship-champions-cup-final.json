Emry, Lurker of the Loch provides card advantage by recurring artifacts from the graveyard, while Tormod's Crypt and Engineered Explosives help disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck's key concept is to rapidly deploy threats and disrupt the opponent's plans in a fast-paced aggressive strategy."
