Cards like Enter the Enigma and Full Bore help to push damage through, while Leyline of Resonance and Turn Inside Out provide additional ways to increase the deck's damage output. The main strategy is to be fast, efficient, and relentless in attacking the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
