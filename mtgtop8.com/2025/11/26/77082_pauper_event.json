By utilizing cards like Krark-Clan Shaman and Fanatical Offering to sacrifice creatures for value, combined with artifact draw from Ichor Wellspring and cleansing abilities from Cleansing Wildfire, the deck aims to maintain card advantage and board presence. Additionally, utilizing Writhing Chrysalis to create insect tokens and Eviscerator's Insight to finish off opponents, this deck can apply pressure and disrupt opponent's plans effectively."
