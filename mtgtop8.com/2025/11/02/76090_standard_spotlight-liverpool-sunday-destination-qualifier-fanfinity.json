The deck aims to apply pressure early on with creatures like Burnout Bashtronaut and Emberheart Challenger, while also having a variety of burn spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike to finish off the opponent. With a low mana curve and a high number of creatures and burn spells, this deck looks to overwhelm the opponent and secure a swift victory."
