Lightning Bolt and Unholy Heat provide direct removal, while cards like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Mishra's Bauble help with card selection and staying ahead in tempo. The deck also includes land disruption with Wasteland and tempo plays with Brazen Borrower. Overall, the deck aims to establish an early advantage and maintain pressure on the opponent."

The deck utilizes Green Sun's Zenith to tutor for specific creatures as needed, and Once Upon a Time for additional consistency. Overall, the deck focuses on explosive plays and overwhelming the opponent with a fast combo finish."
