The deck utilizes cards like Consider, Fiery Impulse, and Opt to fuel the graveyard, while also including cards like Sleight of Hand and Treasure Cruise to draw through the deck quickly. The inclusion of Picklock Prankster and Artist's Talent allow for additional ways to manipulate the graveyard and generate value. The deck aims to be aggressive and relentless in its attacks, while maintaining card advantage and flexibility."
