The deck also includes card draw and graveyard hate to maintain resources and control the game. Overall, the deck leverages aggro strategies in a Jund color scheme to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent in a 1 vs 1 Pauper format."

The key strategy involves ramping up mana with defender creatures like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement, then using cards like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way to find more creatures to play. Annoyed Altisaur and Avenging Hunter provide the finishing blow once the combo is assembled, making it a powerful and explosive deck in the Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
