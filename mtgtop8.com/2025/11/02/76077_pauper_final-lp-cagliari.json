The key strategy is to efficiently use cards like Cleansing Wildfire and Crypt Incursion to disrupt opponents while generating value through cards like Drossforge Bridge and Refurbished Familiar. By playing a mix of threats and disruption, this deck aims to maintain a consistent pressure on opponents while maintaining card advantage and tempo. Additionally, the deck has some lifegain and graveyard recursion to help stabilize against aggressive strategies."
