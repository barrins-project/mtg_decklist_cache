By combining flying, unblockable, and flash creatures with disruptive counterspells, the deck aims to control the pace of the game and overwhelm the opponent with tempo advantage. The inclusion of card draw and card advantage spells helps to maintain a steady stream of threats while keeping the opponent on their toes with counter magic. The overall strategy is to be proactive in applying pressure while being reactive with counterspells to protect our board state."

The deck aims to quickly establish a strong board presence with creatures like Nyxborn Hydra and Bannerhide Krushok, supported by mana acceleration provided by Utopia Sprawl and Wild Growth. The inclusion of Eldrazi Repurposer and Writhing Chrysalis adds versatility and surprise elements to the deck."
