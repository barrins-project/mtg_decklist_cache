By utilizing efficient creatures like Goblin Tomb Raider and Reckless Lackey, along with powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to deal consistent damage and finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. The inclusion of artifact creatures like Clockwork Percussionist and Experimental Synthesizer helps to provide additional threats and synergies with cards like Inventor's Axe. Overall, the deck focuses on applying early pressure and maintaining a high tempo throughout the game."
