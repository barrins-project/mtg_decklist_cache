The deck focuses on using cheap card draw spells like Brainstorm, Thought Scour, and Ponder to maintain card advantage and keep the pressure on. Counterspells like Counterspell and Dispel are used to protect the creatures and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of Lórien Revealed helps to buff the creatures and increase their effectiveness in combat. Overall, the deck aims to win through efficient aggression and disruption."
