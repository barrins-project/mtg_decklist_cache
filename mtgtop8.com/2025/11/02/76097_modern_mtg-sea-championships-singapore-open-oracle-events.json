The inclusion of cards like Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury and Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines provides additional finishers to quickly close out games. With a mix of efficient creatures and disruptive spells like Goblin Bombardment and Blood Moon, the deck seeks to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining a fast and aggressive strategy."
