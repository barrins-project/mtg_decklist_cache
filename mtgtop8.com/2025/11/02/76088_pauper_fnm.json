By sacrificing the creatures in the graveyard, the deck aims to bring back powerful creatures like Lotleth Giant or Avenging Hunter for a game-winning finish. The deck also includes cards like Wall of Roots and Saruli Caretaker to help ramp up mana for larger plays. This deck is designed to be fast-paced and aggressive, aiming to overwhelm the opponent with its combo potential."
