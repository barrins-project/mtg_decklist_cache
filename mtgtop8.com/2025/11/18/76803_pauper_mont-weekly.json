The deck also includes creatures with powerful abilities like generating tokens or returning spells from the graveyard. Additionally, the deck includes a few creatures with flying to provide an alternate win condition. The mana base is built around snow-covered lands to support cards that benefit from snow mana. With a mix of control elements and creature threats, this deck aims to dominate the battlefield and outlast the opponent."
