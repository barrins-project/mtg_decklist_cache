            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by using cards like Archaeomancer, Snap, and Prohibit while gaining value from Ephemerate and Mulldrifter. God-Pharaoh's Faithful and Sunscape Familiar help to stabilize the board against aggressive opponents, while Murmuring Mystic provides a win condition by generating bird tokens. The deck focuses on card advantage with efficient draw spells like Sea Gate Oracle and Mulldrifter, while also including some interaction with removal spells like Remove Soul and Thraben Charm. The mana base is designed to support the color requirements of the spells while also providing some utility with Contaminated Landscape and Mortuary Mire."

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creatures with haste and direct damage spells, with a particular emphasis on dealing damage directly to the opponent rather than controlling the board. By employing a low mana curve and focusing on fast, efficient plays, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize or build up their own board presence."
