This is achieved by using cards like Counterspell, Skred, and Spellstutter Sprite to counter or remove threats, while cards like Augur of Bolas and Brainstorm provide card advantage and selection. Additionally, the deck aims to control the board with creatures like Faerie Seer and Moon-Circuit Hacker, while also having access to burn spells like Galvanic Discharge and Azure Fleet Admiral for additional removal and reach."
