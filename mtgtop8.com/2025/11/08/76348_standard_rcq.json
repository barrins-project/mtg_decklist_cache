            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the opponent's actions through a combination of counterspells, removal, and card draw. By utilizing cards like Get Lost and No More Lies to disrupt the opponent's strategy, while maintaining card advantage with Consult the Star Charts and Meticulous Archive, the player can slowly gain control of the game. Cards like Day of Judgment and Ultima serve as board wipes to reset the battlefield when necessary, while Beza, the Bounding Spring and Marang River Regent provide win conditions. Elspeth, Storm Slayer offers additional removal and card advantage, while Demolition Field provides additional control options."
