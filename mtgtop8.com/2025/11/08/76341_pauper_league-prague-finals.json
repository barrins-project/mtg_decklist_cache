            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to utilize artifact creatures to quickly build a board presence and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive attacks. The deck aims to play multiple cheap artifacts to reduce the cost of powerful creatures like Myr Enforcer and Glint Hawk, enabling fast and efficient aggression. Additionally, the deck incorporates cards like Thoughtcast and Metallic Rebuke to maintain card advantage and disruption. The mana base includes artifact lands for synergy with affinity cards and utility lands for additional support. Overall, this deck emphasizes speed, efficiency, and synergy in order to achieve victory through aggressive plays."
