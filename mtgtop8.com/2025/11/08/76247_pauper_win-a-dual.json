By efficiently dealing damage directly to the opponent or through attacking with creatures, this deck aims to burn through the opponent's life total as fast as possible, ultimately winning the game through aggressive and consistent damage output. This aggressive strategy is supported by the inclusion of card draw and creature recursion to maintain a steady stream of threats and burn spells."
