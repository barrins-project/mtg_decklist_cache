Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Seasoned Pyromancer provide early aggression, while Phlage, Titan of Fire's Fury and Ocelot Pride offer powerful finishers. Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Guide of Souls provide additional aggression and support. The deck also includes utility cards like Thraben Charm and Goblin Bombardment to deal with threats. Blood Moon can disrupt opponents' mana bases, while Static Prison slows down aggressive decks. Overall, this deck aims to win quickly through a combination of creature damage and burn spells."
