By using cards like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast, along with creatures like Guttersnipe and Voldaren Epicure, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total. The inclusion of faithless looting helps to filter through the deck and find the necessary cards to finish off the opponent. Finally, cards like Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery provide additional utility and ways to potentially end the game."
