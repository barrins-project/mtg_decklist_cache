The deck includes support cards like Masked Vandal for removal and Tangled Islet for card draw. The addition of cards like Gnaw to the Bone and Moment's Peace provide the deck with additional survivability against aggressive strategies. By consistently casting Persistent Petitioners and utilizing cards like Winding Way to find them, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with milling pressure."
