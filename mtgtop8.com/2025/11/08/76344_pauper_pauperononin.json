With a focus on affinity cards and synergies, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure throughout the game. The inclusion of disruption and interaction spells such as Mana Leak and Cast Down helps to control the opponent's board while the artifact creatures like Glint Hawk and Myr Enforcer deliver consistent damage. Overall, the deck is designed to be fast-paced and relentless in its assault."
