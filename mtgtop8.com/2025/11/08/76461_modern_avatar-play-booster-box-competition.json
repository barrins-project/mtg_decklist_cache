The key concept is to establish a fast board presence with cheap creatures like Ornithopter and Memnite, while also disrupting opponents with cards like Tormod's Crypt and Engineered Explosives. The deck aims to quickly close out games through aggressive plays and leveraging the synergy of artifact cards within the Affinity archetype."

Phlage serves as a powerful finisher, while Consign to Memory and Wrath of the Skies help control the board. Teferi, Time Raveler provides additional disruption, and Ephemerate allows for value plays with enter-the-battlefield effects. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive strategy while also providing flexibility with lands like Hallowed Fountain and Sacred Foundry."
