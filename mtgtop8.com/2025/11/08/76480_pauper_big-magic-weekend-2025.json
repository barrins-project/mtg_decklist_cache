By combining cards like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement with cards that untap them like Quirion Ranger, the deck can generate massive amounts of mana to cast powerful spells or chain together combos. The deck also includes support cards like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way to ensure a consistent stream of defenders to fuel the combo engine. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a massive amount of mana and powerful spells."
