By incorporating card draw and graveyard manipulation with cards like Thought Scour and Deep Analysis, the deck aims to maintain momentum and outmaneuver the opponent. Sleep of the Dead provides a way to control the opponent's creatures, allowing for a clear path to victory through consistent aggression and strategic decision-making."
