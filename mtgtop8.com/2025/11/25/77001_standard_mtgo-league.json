Ultima serves as a finisher to close out the game once the opponent has been sufficiently disrupted. The deck also includes creatures like Marang River Regent and Shiko, Paragon of the Way for additional threats and can stabilize with lifegain from Lightning Helix. Land base includes a mix of utility lands and dual lands to ensure consistent mana production."
