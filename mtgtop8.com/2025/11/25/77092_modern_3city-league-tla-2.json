Additionally, cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek are used to disrupt the opponent's hand, while Ephemerate and Recruiter of the Guard provide additional card advantage and flexibility. The goal is to quickly overwhelm the opponent and disrupt their strategy while maintaining a strong board presence."
