It aims to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression or stall the game until it can play its high-cost threats. It incorporates a mix of ramp spells, Eldrazi creatures, removal, and utility lands to support its game plan. The key strategy is to use ramp spells to accelerate into powerful threats while disrupting the opponent's game plan with removal and disruption spells."

The deck also includes control elements like Force of Negation and Subtlety to disrupt opponent's strategies. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of fast mana generation and aggressive creatures while maintaining some level of control over the game."
