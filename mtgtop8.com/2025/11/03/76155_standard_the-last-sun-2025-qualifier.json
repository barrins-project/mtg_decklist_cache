By playing cards like Fear of Missing Out and Marauding Mako early on, you put pressure on the opponent while also utilizing cards like Agatha's Soul Cauldron and Profit's Eidetic Memory to draw more cards and maintain card advantage. Additionally, Quantum Riddler provides a way to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Vivi Ornitier and Into the Flood Maw offer additional threats. The deck is focused on quick and efficient plays to win the game quickly."
