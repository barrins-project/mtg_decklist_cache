By playing low-cost creatures like Emberheart Challenger and Razorkin Needlehead, along with direct damage spells like Shock and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to deal damage consistently and rapidly to the opponent's life total. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Nova Hellkite and Burnout Bashtronaut ensures that the pressure is maintained throughout the game, with the potential to close out matches quickly. The mana base is optimized for consistent aggression, with a mix of Mountain cards and utility lands like Rockface Village and Soulstone Sanctuary."
