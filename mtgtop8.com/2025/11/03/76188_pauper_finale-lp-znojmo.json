It aims to control the board with removal spells and creatures like Shambling Ghast and Crypt Rats, while also utilizing cards like Ichor Wellspring and Lembas to draw more resources. The deck includes a mix of efficient removal spells and resilient threats like Avenging Hunter and Troll of Khazad-dûm to slowly grind out the opponent. The mana base supports the strategy by providing consistent access to black mana sources for the deck's spells and abilities."
