It aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, powerful threats while maintaining a steady stream of damage. The key strategy is to apply pressure from the beginning of the game and maintain a relentless assault to secure a quick victory. The deck relies on a mix of creatures with haste and burn spells to close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
