By utilizing cards like Quirion Ranger and Birchlore Rangers to generate mana, the deck aims to play threats like Nyxborn Hydra and Timberwatch Elf early on to overwhelm the opponent. Cards like Wellwisher provide additional longevity, while Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help keep the player's hand full of options. The overall strategy is to flood the board with elves and use their synergy to quickly defeat the opponent."
