The deck includes powerful creatures like Solitude, Ragavan, and Phlage to pressure the opponent while utilizing cards like Quantum Riddler and Teferi, Time Raveler to disrupt their strategy. Prismatic Ending and Consign to Memory provide removal options, while Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and March of Otherworldly Light offer additional utility. The mana base is carefully designed to support the deck's color requirements, ensuring smooth gameplay and enabling powerful synergies."
