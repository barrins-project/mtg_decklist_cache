Teferi, Time Raveler and Ephemerate provide additional disruption, while Elesh Norn and Fable of the Mirror-Breaker offer powerful win conditions. The mix of aggression and disruption makes it a versatile and challenging deck to face in 1 vs 1 matchups."

Glimpse the Impossible and Reckless Impulse help to draw into key combo pieces, while Past in Flames allows for recursion of those spells. The deck aims to create a fast-paced, explosive win condition by chaining together spells and overwhelming the opponent with damage in a single turn."
