By efficiently casting powerful creatures like Myr Enforcer and Gearseeker Serpent, as well as using removal spells like Cast Down and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and control the board. The inclusion of card draw spells like Thoughtcast and Reckoner's Bargain helps maintain card advantage, while mana-fixing lands like Seat of the Synod and Mistvault Bridge ensure a smooth gameplay experience."

Additionally, cards like Unearth and Corrupted Conviction provide additional value and ways to reuse creatures from the graveyard. The deck aims to flood the board with aggressive threats and outpace the opponent before they can stabilize."
