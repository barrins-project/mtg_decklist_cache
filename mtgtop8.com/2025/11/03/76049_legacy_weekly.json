            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressively deploying Eldrazi creatures to overwhelm the opponent quickly. By utilizing powerful Eldrazi threats such as Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer, combined with disruptive spells like Kozilek's Command and Chalice of the Void, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining a strong board presence. The mana acceleration provided by Lotus Petal and Eldrazi Temple allows for explosive starts, while cards like Wasteland and Eye of Ugin provide additional utility and mana fixing. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and capitalize on the opponent's mistakes to secure a victory."
