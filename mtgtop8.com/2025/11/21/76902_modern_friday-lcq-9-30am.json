The deck focuses on applying early pressure with efficient creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Ocelot Pride, while also utilizing powerful burn spells like Galvanic Discharge and Goblin Bombardment to finish off opponents quickly. Ajani, Nacatl Pariah and Seasoned Pyromancer provide additional value and card advantage, while cards like Voice of Victory and Thraben Charm help to control the board and protect key creatures. Additionally, cards like Blood Moon can disrupt opponents' mana bases, giving the deck a strategic advantage."

The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures and disruption, ultimately leading to victory through sheer power and resource denial."

It focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy and maintaining board control through counterspells, removal spells, and powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Time Raveler. The deck also includes card draw engines like Narset, Parter of Veils and Meticulous Archive to ensure consistency and resource management. With a mix of control elements and card advantage, it aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent until it can secure a win condition."
