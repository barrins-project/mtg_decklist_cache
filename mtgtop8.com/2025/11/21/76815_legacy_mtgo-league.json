The key strategy is to cast spells to generate storm count, then cast Tendrils of Agony to drain the opponent's life total. Cards like Gaea's Will and Defense Grid help protect the combo, while Echo of Eons allows for a fresh hand of cards to continue the storm. Burning Wish serves as a versatile tool to tutor for key combo pieces from the sideboard. Ultimately, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells."

This combo-reanimator deck relies on a mix of disruption and card selection to protect its game plan, utilizing cards like Thoughtseize, Force of Will, and Daze to control the opponent's actions. With a strong mix of threats like Archon of Cruelty and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with quick, powerful plays and efficient reanimation spells."
