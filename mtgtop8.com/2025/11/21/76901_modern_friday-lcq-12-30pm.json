By using cards like Curator of Mysteries and Generous Ent for card draw and Shardless Agent for cascade triggers, the deck can efficiently set up its combo. Force of Negation offers protection while Endurance and Subtlety provide disruption for the opponent. The deck also includes unique creatures like Waker of Waves and Troll of Khazad-dûm to enhance its strategy. Overall, the key idea is to overwhelm the opponent with a sudden surge of creatures from the graveyard."

            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to efficiently ramp up mana using cards like Arboreal Grazer and Amulet of Vigor, allowing you to quickly cast powerful spells like Primeval Titan and Scapeshift. By utilizing lands like Urza's Saga and utility lands like Boseiju, Who Endures, you can search for specific cards and protect your key spells from counterspells. The goal is to assemble the necessary pieces to create a powerful board state and overwhelm your opponent with a big attack or combo finish."
