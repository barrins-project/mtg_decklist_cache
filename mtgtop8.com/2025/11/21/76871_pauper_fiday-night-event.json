The combo aspect comes from the synergy between cards like Lotleth Giant and Generous Ent, along with support cards like Satyr Wayfinder and Stinkweed Imp. The deck also includes cards like Molten Gatekeeper and Spider Manifestation to control the board and generate value. The lands are chosen to support the overall strategy and ensure consistency in mana production."
