By efficiently playing aggressive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Tolarian Terror, backed up by countermagic like Counterspell and Spell Pierce, the deck aims to apply constant pressure while disrupting the opponent's game plan. Thought Scour and Deep Analysis provide card advantage, while cards like Brainstorm and Preordain help smooth out draws and find necessary answers. The goal is to maintain tempo and outpace the opponent to secure a quick victory."
