            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with quick and aggressive creatures, utilizing direct damage spells to control the board and finish off the opponent quickly. The deck focuses on dealing damage as fast as possible, using cards that benefit from dealing damage to the opponent or their creatures. The goal is to apply pressure early in the game and maintain it until victory, closing out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
