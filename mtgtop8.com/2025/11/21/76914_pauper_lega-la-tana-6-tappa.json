By combining creatures like Refurbished Familiar and Nyxborn Hydra with removal and support spells like Cast Down and Cleansing Wildfire, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Ichor Wellspring and Lembas allows for card advantage and additional resources, while cards like Krark-Clan Shaman and Gixian Infiltrator disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck focuses on fast, efficient aggression to secure victory."
