By efficiently playing cheap artifacts, the deck aims to quickly deploy powerful threats like Myr Enforcer and Galvanic Blast to apply pressure and close out the game. The inclusion of cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Metallic Rebuke allows for disruption and protection, while Thoughtcast helps to consistently draw into more resources. Overall, the deck seeks to maintain a fast pace and capitalize on synergy between artifacts and aggressive creatures to secure victory."
