With efficient card draw through Expressive Iteration and Preordain, this deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent and finish the game quickly. Overall, the strategy is to hit hard and fast, overwhelming the opponent before they can stabilize."

It utilizes lands like Urza's Saga and Simic Growth Chamber to generate additional value and set up explosive plays with cards like Scapeshift. The deck aims to assemble the Amulet Titan combo quickly and overwhelm opponents with big creatures and land-based synergies. Malevolent Rumble provides additional removal and disruption, while cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Summoner's Pact help to find key combo pieces. The deck's strategy revolves around exploiting the synergy between lands and creatures to win the game."
