The goal is to quickly ramp up to play a Primeval Titan, fetch more lands, and then either win through a massive Scapeshift or by tutoring for key pieces with Green Sun's Zenith. The deck also includes versatile cards like Aftermath Analyst and Vexing Bauble to provide additional value and card draw. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with explosive plays and outvalue them in the long run."

The deck also includes versatile removal options like Prismatic Ending and Wrath of the Skies to deal with threats efficiently. With card advantage engines like Teferi, Time Raveler and Lórien Revealed, the deck aims to outvalue opponents and grind out a win over time."
