Season of Loss provides removal options, while Overlord of the Balemurk serves as a powerful finisher. The inclusion of utility lands like Cryptic Caves and Fabled Passage allows for flexibility in mana fixing and card draw. The deck seeks to outpace and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays."
