The deck also includes several utility spells like Force of Negation and Prismatic Ending to help control the game and protect its combo pieces. The key strategy is to quickly reanimate a game-winning threat and overwhelm the opponent before they can respond."

It utilizes cards like Mox Opal and Mishra's Bauble to fuel its engine, while also including key pieces like Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Kethis, the Hidden Hand to recur important spells. The deck can also disrupt opponents with cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Agatha's Soul Cauldron. Overall, the strategy is to set up a powerful board state and quickly combo off to secure the win."
