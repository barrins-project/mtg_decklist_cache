It aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly with creatures like Kor Skyfisher and Raffine's Informant while providing some evasion with creatures like Eagles of the North. The deck also includes some protection and combat tricks with cards like Prismatic Strands and Thraben Charm to maintain board presence. The deck's high creature count and low mana curve allow for fast and consistent aggression, putting pressure on the opponent from the start."
