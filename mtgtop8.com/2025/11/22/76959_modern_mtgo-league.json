By utilizing cards like Leyline Binding and Birthing Ritual to ramp up mana, the deck can easily bring out high-impact threats like Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines and Omnath, Locus of Creation. Bloodbraid Elf and Shardless Agent provide additional value by cascading into more spells, while cards like Subtlety and Solitude help control the board. With a diverse mana base and access to various colors, this deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game."
