The inclusion of Pithing Needle and Shadowspear allows for disruption and additional utility, while the aggressive creature suite of Patchwork Automaton, Kappa Cannoneer, and Memory Guardian provide a strong attacking presence. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its artifact synergies and efficient threats, backed up by countermagic in Force of Will for protection."
