The inclusion of Atraxa, Grand Unifier gives the deck additional synergy and utility, making it a strong and versatile combo deck in the Legacy format."

With a mix of disruption spells like Thoughtseize and counterspells like Force of Will, along with removal like Fatal Push, the deck aims to keep the opponent on the back foot. By leveraging powerful threats like Murktide Regent and Brazen Borrower, as well as card advantage engines like Brainstorm and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student, the deck aims to pressure the opponent while maintaining a steady stream of resources to outvalue them."
