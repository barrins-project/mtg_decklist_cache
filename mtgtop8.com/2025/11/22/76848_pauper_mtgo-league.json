By utilizing cards like Galvanic Blast and Krark-Clan Shaman to deal damage to your opponent's creatures and face, while also controlling the board with cards like Cleansing Wildfire and Cast Down, you aim to outpace your opponent and secure a victory. Utilizing artifact and land destruction can disrupt your opponent's game plan, while also providing card advantage with Ichor Wellspring and Drossforge Bridge. Overall, this deck focuses on fast, efficient aggression and disruption to secure a win."
