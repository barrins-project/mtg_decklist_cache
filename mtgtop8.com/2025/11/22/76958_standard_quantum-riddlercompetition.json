It also utilises card draw and card advantage to outvalue opponents and maintain a strong hand. The inclusion of versatile spells like Mystical Teachings and Jeskai Revelation allows for flexibility in response to different threats. The mana base is designed to support a three-color strategy, with a mix of shocklands, checklands, and tri-lands to ensure consistency in casting spells of different colors. Ultimately, the goal is to outlast opponents and win through incremental advantage."
