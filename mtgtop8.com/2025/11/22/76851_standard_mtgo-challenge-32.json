            "notes": "The main strategy of this deck is to play aggressively with a mix of blue and red cards. Cards like Boomerang Basics, Multiversal Passage, and Riverpyre Verge allow for efficient control and tempo plays, while Duelist of the Mind and Quantum Riddler provide card advantage. Marauding Mako and Tiger-Seal are strong threats that can quickly close out the game, while Torch the Tower and Stormchaser's Talent offer versatile removal options. The inclusion of Frostcliff Siege and Winternight Stories provide additional value and flexibility, making this deck a powerful and dynamic aggro option in Standard 1 vs 1."
