Cards like Llanowar Elves and Ouroboroid help ramp up mana for bigger threats like Sab-Sunen, Luxa Embodied and Tyvar, the Pummeler. The deck also includes some control elements like Spyglass Siren and Repulsive Mutation to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the strategy focuses on fast-paced aggression and board dominance."
