The deck also aims to generate value through spells like Cleansing Wildfire and Lórien Revealed to disrupt the opponent's mana base. The mana base consists of a mix of Snow lands and dual lands to ensure consistency in casting spells. Overall, the deck seeks to outvalue and outlast opponents in a one-on-one Pauper format."
