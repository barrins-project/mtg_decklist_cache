By deploying cheap creatures with abilities that can quickly boost their power, backed up by burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Rally at the Hornburg and Wrenn's Resolve provide additional support and resilience to maintain pressure on the opponent. The deck's focus on speed and aggression makes it a formidable force in the Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
