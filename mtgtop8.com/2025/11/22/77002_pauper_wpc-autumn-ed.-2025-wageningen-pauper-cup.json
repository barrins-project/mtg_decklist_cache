By ramping up mana with Arbor Elf, Utopia Sprawl, and Wild Growth, the deck can cast powerful creatures like Avenging Hunter and Annoyed Altisaur ahead of schedule. Additionally, the inclusion of Mwonvuli Acid-Moss and Thermokarst disrupts the opponent's mana base, setting them back while the Gruul player continues to build their board presence. With a mix of efficient creatures and disruptive spells, this deck aims to win fast and decisively."
