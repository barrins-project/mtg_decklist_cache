The main goal is to quickly build a board presence, counter opponent's spells with cards like Counterspell and Dispel, and finish off the opponent with powerful creatures like Cryptic Serpent. Sleep of the Dead can provide a way to lock down the opponent's blockers, while Lórien Revealed can provide additional card advantage."
