By constantly playing small creatures like Thraben Inspector and Novice Inspector, you can quickly build a board presence and apply pressure. Cards like Battle Screech and Guardians' Pledge allow you to pump up your creatures and go wide. Prismatic Strands provides protection for your team, while Kor Skyfisher and Raffine's Informant offer some card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to flood the board with creatures and close out the game before your opponent has a chance to stabilize."
