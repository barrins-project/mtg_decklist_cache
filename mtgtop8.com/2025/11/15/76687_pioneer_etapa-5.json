By playing low-cost creatures like Ornithopter and Novice Inspector early on, and then boosting them with cards like Venerated Loxodon and Cosmogrand Zenith, the deck aims to apply pressure and deal damage quickly. Additionally, cards like Gleeful Demolition provide removal options, while Case of the Gateway Express offers a finisher. With a mix of creatures, pumps, and removal, this deck seeks to win the game through fast and efficient combat."
