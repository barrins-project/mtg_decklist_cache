It also looks to generate value and card advantage by recurring lands with Life from the Loam and utilizing the Urza's Saga land package. Additionally, the deck can create threats with Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis, and Grist, the Hunger Tide while maintaining a strong mana base with Mox Diamond and fetch lands. The inclusion of cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Pithing Needle also helps in disrupting graveyard and activated abilities of key cards."
