The deck also includes various ways to search for key pieces, disrupt your opponent's strategies, and protect your own resources. It relies on using Primeval Titan to search for additional lands and combo pieces, while also being able to potentially lock your opponent out of the game with cards like Karn's Sylex and Planar Nexus. The deck's versatility and power make it a strong contender in the Legacy format."
