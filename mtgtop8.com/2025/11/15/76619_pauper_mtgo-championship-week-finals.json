It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of direct damage while also maintaining card advantage through looting effects. The strategy involves using cheap burn spells and creatures with a high potential for damage output to close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. It's a fast-paced and aggressive deck that aims to end the game as quickly as possible."
