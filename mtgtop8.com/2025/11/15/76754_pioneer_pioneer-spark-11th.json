It utilizes cards like Fable of the Mirror-Breaker to fill the graveyard, Grisly Salvage and Otherworldly Gaze to dig for combo pieces, and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of powerful threats and disruptive spells. Boseiju, Who Endures and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth provide additional utility and mana fixing to support the deck's game plan."
