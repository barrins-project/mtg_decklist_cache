By efficiently using card draw and tempo plays, this deck aims to chip away at the opponent's life total while maintaining control of the board. The synergy between cheap creatures and disruptive spells allows for a fast-paced and aggressive strategy that can catch opponents off-guard and secure victories in the Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
