By using cards like Force of Negation, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Supreme Verdict, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining card advantage with Narset and Lórien Revealed. The inclusion of Isochron Scepter allows for even more control options, while Solitude provides a versatile removal option. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and provide consistency in casting spells."
