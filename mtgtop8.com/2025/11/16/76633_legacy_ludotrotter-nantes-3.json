            "notes": "The main concept of this Dragon Stompy deck is to disrupt the opponent's game plan by utilizing cards like Blood Moon, Trinisphere, Chalice of the Void, and Magus of the Moon to prevent them from casting spells effectively. The deck aims to quickly play out powerful threats like Karn, the Great Creator, Pyrogoyf, and Broadside Bombardiers to close out the game before the opponent can recover. The deck also includes removal spells like Sundering Eruption and Fury to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the strategy is to lock down the opponent while deploying aggressive threats to secure victory."

The inclusion of Grist, the Hunger Tide and Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis provide additional threats and win conditions. With synergies between land destruction, discard spells, and graveyard recursion, the deck aims to control the game and grind out victories through attrition."
