In addition to efficient creatures, the deck includes disruption in the form of counterspells like Counterspell and Spellstutter Sprite, as well as card draw with cards like Of One Mind. By controlling the board and constantly applying pressure, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can set up their own game plan."
