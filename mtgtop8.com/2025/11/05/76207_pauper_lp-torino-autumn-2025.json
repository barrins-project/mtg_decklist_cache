The creatures included are large threats that can be cast for a low mana cost, allowing for a quick clock to be put on the opponent once control has been established. The deck also includes evasion and token generation to provide alternative win conditions. The mana base is heavily skewed towards Islands to ensure consistent access to blue mana sources."
