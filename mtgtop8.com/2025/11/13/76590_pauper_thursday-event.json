By utilizing cards that can sacrifice artifacts for additional value and deal direct damage to the opponent, along with card draw and mana fixing, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain it throughout the game. The combination of aggressive creatures and efficient spells allows for explosive plays and a fast-paced, high-energy playstyle."
