Lead the Stampede, Winding Way, and Drift of Phantasms help you dig through your deck to find your essential cards like Axebane Guardian, Overgrown Battlement, and Freed from the Real. Once you have your combo pieces in play, you can use them to generate infinite mana and win the game with Valakut Invoker or Reaping the Graves."
