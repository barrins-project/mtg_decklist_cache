The key strategy involves playing creatures like Annoyed Altisaur and Bannerhide Krushok to protect yourself while setting up for a big combo turn with cards like Malevolent Rumble and Eldrazi Repurposer. By efficiently ramping up mana with Utopia Sprawl and Wild Growth, this deck aims to outpace and outvalue the opponent to secure victory in a Pauper 1 vs 1 matchup."
