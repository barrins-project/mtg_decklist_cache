The key strategy is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a mix of creatures with varying abilities and power levels, utilizing cards like Tyvar, the Pummeler and Tishana's Tidebinder for additional synergies and control. The deck also includes land cards like Botanical Sanctum and Multiversal Passage for consistent mana fixing and ramp."
