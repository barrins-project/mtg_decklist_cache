The deck utilizes a mix of counterspells like Dovin's Veto and removal spells like Portable Hole and Supreme Verdict to deal with threats efficiently. By generating card advantage with cards like Memory Deluge and Consult the Star Charts, the deck aims to out-value opponents and eventually win through incremental advantage. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value and flexibility in longer games."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively use low-cost and efficient creatures and removal spells to quickly control the board and chip away at the opponent's life total. By combining powerful creatures like Carnage, Crimson Chaos and Tinybones Joins Up with disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push, the deck aims to maintain card advantage and pressure the opponent into making suboptimal plays. Additionally, the mana base is designed to support a fast and consistent gameplay by allowing for a smooth curve of plays and ensuring the deck's color requirements are met."
