            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent quickly with low-cost, efficient creatures and protect them with counter spells. The deck is designed to be fast-paced and aggressive, using cards like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent to apply pressure early on. Drawing cards and manipulating the top of the deck with spells like Ponder and Brainstorm help to ensure a steady stream of threats. The inclusion of Lórien Revealed and Murmuring Mystic provide additional creature options while Sleep of the Dead can help clear blockers and push for lethal damage."
