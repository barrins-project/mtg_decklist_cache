The key strategy is to put pressure on the opponent early in the game with cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage, while using burn spells like Burst Lightning and Reckless Rage to clear the way for your creatures to attack. By combining fast creatures with direct damage, this deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total before they can establish a solid defense."
