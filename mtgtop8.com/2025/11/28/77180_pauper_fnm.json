By utilizing cards like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, along with creatures like Guttersnipe and Kessig Flamebreather, the player aims to quickly deplete their opponent's life total. By incorporating some card draw with Faithless Looting and Grab the Prize, the deck maintains consistency in its aggressive strategy. The inclusion of burn spells like Fireblast and Lava Dart allows for additional burst damage to close out games quickly."
