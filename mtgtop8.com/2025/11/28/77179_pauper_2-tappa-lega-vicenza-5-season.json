Supporting cards like Myr Retriever and Ashnod's Altar provide additional value and recursion, while cards like Pactdoll Terror and Malevolent Rumble help control the board and disrupt your opponent's strategies. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful spells and creatures while maintaining control of the game."
