The deck aims to have a fast start with early threats like Gilded Goose and Cauldron Familiar, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Abrupt Decay and Fatal Push. With cards like Witch's Oven and Scavenger's Talent, the deck can create a loop of sacrificing and bringing back creatures to overwhelm the opponent. The deck also has a strong late-game presence with cards like Ygra, Eater of All and Vinereap Mentor."
