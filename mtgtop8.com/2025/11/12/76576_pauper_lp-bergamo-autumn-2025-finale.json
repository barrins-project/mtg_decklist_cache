By using cards like Cleansing Wildfire and Galvanic Blast alongside creatures like Kor Skyfisher and Glint Hawk, the deck aims to keep the pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan. The inclusion of artifact cards like Relic of Progenitus and Cryogen Relic add versatility and further synergy to the overall strategy. The deck also includes a mix of card draw and land destruction to maintain advantage while applying pressure."
