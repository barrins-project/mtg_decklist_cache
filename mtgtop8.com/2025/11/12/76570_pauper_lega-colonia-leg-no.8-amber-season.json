By maximizing damage output with cards like Guttersnipe and Lightning Bolt while also providing card advantage with Faithless Looting and Grab the Prize, the deck aims to push through the opponent's defenses and finish the game as quickly as possible. With a low mana curve and a high concentration of burn spells, the deck is designed to be fast and efficient in dealing damage to secure a victory in the early game."
