By playing smaller creatures early to pressure the opponent and then following up with bigger threats, the deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of removal spells and card draw options helps to maintain a consistent game plan and keep the pressure on throughout the match."

By combining aggressive creatures with disruptive spells, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and push through damage efficiently. The inclusion of evasion abilities on creatures like Ninja of the Deep Hours further enhances the deck's ability to deal damage while protecting itself."
