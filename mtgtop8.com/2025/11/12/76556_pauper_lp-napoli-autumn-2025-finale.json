By playing low-cost creatures like Lagonna-Band Trailblazer and Sacred Cat, and then buffing them with cards like Ethereal Armor and Hyena Umbra, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and deal damage consistently. The inclusion of cards like Blacksmith's Skill and Cartouche of Solidarity further enhances the aggression of the deck, while defensive options like Spirit Link and Benevolent Blessing provide protection for key creatures."
