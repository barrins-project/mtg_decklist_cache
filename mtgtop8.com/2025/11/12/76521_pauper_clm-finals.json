By utilizing efficient creatures like Goblin Bushwhacker and Voldaren Epicure, combined with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, the goal is to establish a strong board presence and deal direct damage to the opponent's life total. The inclusion of artifacts like Inventor's Axe and Clockwork Percussionist further enhances the deck's ability to push through damage and close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
