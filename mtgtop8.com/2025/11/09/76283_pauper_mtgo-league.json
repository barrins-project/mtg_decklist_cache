By efficiently casting cheap artifacts and utilizing synergies between cards such as Ichor Wellspring and Refurbished Familiar, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats and removal options. The inclusion of cards like Galvanic Blast and Krark-Clan Shaman provides additional reach and removal options to help close out the game quickly."
