By using cards like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Guide of Souls to apply pressure, along with Static Prison to control the opponent's board, the deck aims to win quickly before the opponent can stabilize. With a mix of burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Discharge for removal, as well as card draw and selection tools like Preordain and Expressive Iteration, the deck aims to maintain its aggression while disrupting the opponent's plans."

The deck also utilizes card draw and scrying effects to find the necessary cards to maintain control. Additionally, there are powerful finishers in the form of Murktide Regent and Dragon's Rage Channeler to quickly close out the game once the opponent has been neutralized. The deck focuses on efficiently managing resources and disrupting the opponent's game plan to secure victory."
