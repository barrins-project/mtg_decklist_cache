With a focus on early game pressure and board presence, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. Cards like Writhing Chrysalis and Malevolent Rumble are used to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Jewel Thief and Boarding Party provide additional value and aggression. Overall, this deck emphasizes aggression and tempo to outpace the opponent and secure victory."
