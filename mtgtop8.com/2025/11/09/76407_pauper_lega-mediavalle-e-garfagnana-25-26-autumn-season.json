The deck focuses on generating card advantage through cards like Ichor Wellspring and Lembas, while also disrupting the opponent's graveyard with Nihil Spellbomb. The win condition is to outvalue the opponent through efficient removal spells like Cast Down and Defile, while also having threats like Avenging Hunter and Troll of Khazad-dûm to close out the game. The deck also utilizes tokens from Khalni Garden to generate additional value."
