By using cheap spells and card draw effects, the deck aims to control the board while creating pressure with evasive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Tolarian Terror. The inclusion of Sleep of the Dead allows for a temporary stall in the opponent's offensive while setting up for a big swing in the following turn. With a heavy emphasis on tempo and card advantage, this Mono Blue Aggro deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
