            "notes": "The main focus of this mono blue aggro deck is to consistently apply pressure on the opponent with cheap and aggressive creatures like Brinebarrow Intruder, Faerie Miscreant, and Ninja of the Deep Hours. The deck also relies on counter spells such as Spellstutter Sprite and Counterspell to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining a consistent card advantage with cards like Moon-Circuit Hacker and Of One Mind. By utilizing a low mana curve, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent and control the game tempo to secure a victory."
