By utilizing the affinity mechanic to reduce the cost of your artifact spells, you can deploy threats early and consistently. The deck also includes disruption in the form of removal and graveyard hate to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The key to victory lies in efficiently deploying threats and maintaining pressure to outpace the opponent before they can mount a defense."
