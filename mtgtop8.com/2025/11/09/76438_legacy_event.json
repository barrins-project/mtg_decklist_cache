The deck also aims to control the board with spells like Lightning Bolt and Unholy Heat, allowing the aggro creatures to deal damage efficiently. By utilizing a combination of cheap spells and card draw effects like Brainstorm and Ponder, the deck looks to maintain a consistent pressure on the opponent while maintaining card advantage and tempo."
