Cards like Day of Judgment and Perilous Snare remove threats from the board, while Authority of the Consuls and Repurposing Bay help to gain life and prevent opponents from gaining too much of an advantage. The deck also utilizes cards like United Battlefront and Cryogen Relic to generate card advantage and stay ahead in the game. By controlling the board and resources, this deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents in a game of attrition."
