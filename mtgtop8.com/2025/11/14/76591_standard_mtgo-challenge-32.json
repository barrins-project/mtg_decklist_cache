The key strategy is to efficiently interact with the opponent's threats while maintaining card advantage and setting up win conditions through Ral, Crackling Wit and Quantum Riddler. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to both blue and red mana sources to cast the spells in the deck. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while advancing its own win conditions through a mix of card advantage and threat removal."
