The use of evasive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent, alongside tempo plays like Sleep of the Dead, helps to maintain aggression while disrupting the opponent's game plan."

This strategy is enhanced by cards like Drossforge Bridge and Ichor Wellspring to generate additional resources. Krark-Clan Shaman provides a versatile removal option while also benefiting from sacrifice effects. Cleansing Wildfire allows for targeted land destruction, while the deck also includes some direct removal in the form of Cast Down."

The inclusion of Quirion Ranger allows for extra mana efficiency and the ability to untap Priest of Titania multiple times. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to refill the hand with more Elves, while Masked Vandal provides removal for opposing threats. Avenging Hunter and Generous Ent serve as powerful finishers to quickly close out games."
