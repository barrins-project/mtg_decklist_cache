            "notes": "This Control - Pox deck aims to disrupt the opponent's hand and resources while gradually grinding them out with attrition. By using cards like Thoughtseize, Hymn to Tourach, and Smallpox, the deck aims to control the game and strip away the opponent's options. It also utilizes graveyard recursion with Life from the Loam and Grist, the Hunger Tide, as well as efficient removal with Abrupt Decay and Shadowspear. The deck looks to establish a lock on the game by utilizing lands like Wasteland and Urza's Saga while gradually building up its own board presence with threats like Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis and Barrowgoyf."
