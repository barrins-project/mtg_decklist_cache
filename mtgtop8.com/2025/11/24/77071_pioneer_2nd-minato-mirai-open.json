By continuously bouncing creatures back to hand with Retraction Helix, players can disrupt opponents' strategies and maintain board presence.

The deck also includes various mana accelerants like Mox Amber and Mox Jasper to ramp up quickly and cast powerful spells. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a strong combo strategy."

            "notes": "This Rakdos Aggro deck revolves around leveraging cheap removal spells and disruptive hand disruption to control the board while deploying aggressive threats. With a mix of efficient removal like Fatal Push and Thoughtseize, along with powerful creatures like Bloodtithe Harvester and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while steadily chipping away at their life total. The versatility of the deck is further enhanced by the inclusion of cards like Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger, providing additional reach and value in longer games."
