The deck includes powerful cards like Elspeth, Storm Slayer and Demon Wall to control the board, backed up by cards like Shoot the Sheriff and Seam Rip to deal with opposing threats. The deck also features a mix of cheap creatures like Preacher of the Schism and Deep-Cavern Bat to apply pressure early on, while cards like Unholy Annex and Elegy Acolyte provide additional utility and support. The mana base is optimized for a smooth curve and efficient use of both white and black mana sources."
