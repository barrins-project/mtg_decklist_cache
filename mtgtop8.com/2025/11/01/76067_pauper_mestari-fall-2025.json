With a mix of low-cost creatures and burn spells, the deck aims to deal damage consistently and efficiently. By utilizing cards like Guttersnipe and Lightning Bolt, along with the synergy of cards like Faithless Looting and Grab the Prize, the deck can apply pressure from the early game and maintain a steady stream of damage throughout the match."
