Cards like Metallic Rebuke and Sink into Stupor provide disruption and control elements to help retain tempo. The inclusion of Emry, Lurker of the Loch allows for recursion of artifacts from the graveyard, while Urza's Saga provides additional artifact creatures and artifacts to further enhance the aggro strategy."
