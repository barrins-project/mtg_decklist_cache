The deck aims to quickly put pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze. The inclusion of cards like Brazen Borrower and Murktide Regent provide additional threats to close out the game quickly. The land base is focused on maximizing mana efficiency and disruption with Wasteland and fetch lands."
