By combining aggressive creature attacks with efficient removal spells like Galvanic Blast, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a unrelenting stream of threats. The inclusion of cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum allows for explosive starts and fast mana acceleration, giving the deck a tempo advantage over slower opponents. The goal is to maintain pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
