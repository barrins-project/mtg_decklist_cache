It aims to outvalue the opponent by generating card advantage with Narset, Parter of Veils and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, while also having access to versatile removal spells like Supreme Verdict and Dovin's Veto. The deck also includes win conditions like Elspeth, Storm Slayer and March of Otherworldly Light to close out the game once the opponent has been sufficiently controlled. The mana base is designed to support the control elements with utility lands and dual lands for consistent mana fixing."
