Control elements like Stab and Phantom Interference ensure that the opponent's strategies are disrupted, allowing for a smoother path to victory. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats and disruption."

The goal is to maintain a steady flow of creatures and spells to apply constant pressure on the opponent, while also having a variety of options to deal with threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base provides a good balance of colors to ensure consistent casting of spells and creatures throughout the game."
