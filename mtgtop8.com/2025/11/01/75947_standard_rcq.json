The deck aims to apply pressure early on with aggressive creatures and then close out the game with direct damage spells like Fear of Missing Out and Fuel the Flames. The deck also includes cards that provide card advantage and allow for flexibility in mana usage, giving the deck a versatile and unpredictable playstyle."
