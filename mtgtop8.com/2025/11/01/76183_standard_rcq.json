The deck focuses on card advantage through spells like Deadly Cover-Up and card draw with Rakshasa's Bargain. The creatures in the deck provide additional control elements and can generate value over time. The mana base is designed to support the three-color Sultai Control archetype, allowing for flexibility in casting spells of different colors. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and win through incremental advantage."
