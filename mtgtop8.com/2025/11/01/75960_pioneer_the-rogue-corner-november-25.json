It aims to control the opponent's board while steadily building up its own resources through cards like Voice of Victory and Graveyard Trespasser. The deck also includes a strong late-game option in Sheoldred, the Apocalypse and has access to versatile removal spells like Fatal Push and Vanishing Verse. Overall, the deck excels at disrupting the opponent's game plan and outvaluing them with its powerful threats."
