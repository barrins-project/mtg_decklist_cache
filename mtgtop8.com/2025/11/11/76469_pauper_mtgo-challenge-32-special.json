The mana base is designed to support the spells efficiently, with a mix of Islands and Contaminated Aquifers.

Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Guttersnipe and Grab the Prize provide additional value and reach to close out games quickly. The deck's strategy is to be fast and relentless in its aggression."
