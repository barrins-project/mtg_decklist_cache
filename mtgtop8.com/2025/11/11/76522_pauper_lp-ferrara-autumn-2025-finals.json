The deck includes card draw spells, cantrips, and tutors to help find key pieces of the combo. Augur of Bolas provides additional card advantage, while Snap can be used to reuse key untap effects. The deck is heavily reliant on Islands to fuel its mana generation, making sure to hit land drops and build up to a powerful combo turn."
