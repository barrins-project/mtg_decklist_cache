            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly flood the board with artifact creatures and utilize various artifact synergies to overwhelm the opponent with a fast-paced aggressive strategy. The deck aims to efficiently draw cards with Thoughtcast and control the board with removal spells like Cast Down while also benefiting from cards like Cryogen Relic and Glint Hawk. It also includes some graveyard hate and lifegain options to keep the pressure on the opponent and maintain a strong board presence."
