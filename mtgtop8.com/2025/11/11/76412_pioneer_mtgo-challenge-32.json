This mana is then used to power out powerful combo pieces such as Scapeshift and Thassa's Oracle. The deck also includes ways to protect its combo pieces, such as Boseiju, Who Endures, and Wishclaw Talisman. Overall, the strategy focuses on ramping up mana early in the game to win through a powerful combo finish. The cards in the deck work together to create a consistent and powerful combo deck."

            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly fill the graveyard with spells, allowing for the reanimation of Arclight Phoenix and generating card advantage through Treasure Cruise. Utilizing cheap interactive spells and cantrips, while also incorporating a game-winning threat in Arclight Phoenix, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its aggressive playstyle and resource efficiency. The inclusion of Temporal Trespass provides a powerful finisher option, ensuring the deck can maintain pressure and close out games against slower opponents. The deck's synergy between graveyard recursion and card draw enables it to maintain a consistent aggressive strategy throughout the game."
