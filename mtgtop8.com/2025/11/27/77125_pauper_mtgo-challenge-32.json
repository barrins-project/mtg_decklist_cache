By utilizing cards like Snuff Out, Defile, and Cast Down, the deck can efficiently deal with opposing threats while generating card advantage with Ichor Wellspring and Tithing Blade. The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's graveyard with Nihil Spellbomb and Bojuka Bog while maintaining a creature presence with cards like Thorn of the Black Rose and Crypt Rats. Khalni Garden provides additional creature tokens to apply pressure on the opponent."
