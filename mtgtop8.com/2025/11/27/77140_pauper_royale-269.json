The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and removal spells, and to utilize the mana acceleration to play multiple threats each turn. The deck aims to be aggressive and fast, putting pressure on the opponent early in the game and maintaining it throughout. By efficiently using mana and playing threats that are difficult to deal with, the deck aims to quickly finish the game before the opponent can stabilize."

By using cheap creatures like Novice Inspector and Squadron Hawk, along with cards like Guardians' Pledge and Battle Screech to pump them up, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Additionally, cards like Journey to Nowhere and Piercing Rays are included to control the opponent's board and clear a path for your creatures to attack. The deck's strategy revolves around maintaining a strong board presence and aggressive playstyle."
