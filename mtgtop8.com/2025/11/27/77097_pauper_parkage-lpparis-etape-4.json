By using counterspells and bounce effects, the player aims to control the pace of the game and limit the opponent's options. The inclusion of cheap cantrips and card draw spells helps to ensure consistent access to resources and threats. The win condition comes from efficiently deploying threats like Cryptic Serpent and Murmuring Mystic to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted."
