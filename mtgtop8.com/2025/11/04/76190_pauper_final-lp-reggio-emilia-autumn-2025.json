It also includes removal spells and card draw to maintain momentum. The synergy between artifact creatures and artifact-based spells allows for explosive plays and aggressive strategies, while also providing some flexibility and resilience against removal and disruption. The mana base is optimized for casting the deck's spells efficiently and consistently, with a mix of artifact lands and regular lands to support the deck's color requirements."
