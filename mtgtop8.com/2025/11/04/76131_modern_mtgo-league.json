By utilizing cards like Birthing Ritual, Chord of Calling, and Grist, the Hunger Tide, players can quickly search for and play the creatures they need to either protect themselves or win the game. The inclusion of sacrifice outlets like Viscera Seer and Carrion Feeder allows for synergies with creatures like Cauldron Familiar and Samwise Gamgee, while cards like Endurance provide disruption against graveyard strategies. The deck also includes lands that can produce multiple colors of mana to support its diverse creature base."
