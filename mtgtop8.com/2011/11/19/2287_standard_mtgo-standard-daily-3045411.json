It aims to stabilize the board with board wipes like Day of Judgment and maintain card advantage with cards like Forbidden Alchemy and Think Twice. The win condition is to ultimately resolve powerful finishers like Consecrated Sphinx, Elesh Norn, or White Sun's Zenith. The deck utilizes a mix of creatures, planeswalkers, and enchantments to control the game and outvalue the opponent in the long run."
