The win condition is to stabilize the board with powerful creatures like Sun Titan and Wurmcoil Engine, while controlling the opponent's threats with cards like Day of Judgment and Doom Blade. The deck also includes cards like Forbidden Alchemy and Think Twice to generate card advantage, and Unburial Rites to reanimate powerful creatures from the graveyard. The goal is to outvalue the opponent and ultimately grind out a win through efficient control and powerful threats."
