The deck's mana base allows for consistent access to its powerful spells, and cards like Eternal Witness provide recursion and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain a strong board presence to close out the game quickly."

By utilizing cards like Cryptic Command, Spell Snare, and Rune Snag, the deck aims to counter opponent's threats and maintain control of the game. Additionally, cards like Vedalken Shackles and Venser, Shaper Savant provide additional disruption by stealing creatures or bouncing them back to the opponent's hand. The deck also includes efficient threats like Tarmogoyf and Vendilion Clique to apply pressure and close out games quickly. Ultimately, the deck seeks to disrupt the opponent's game plan while establishing a fast and aggressive board presence."
