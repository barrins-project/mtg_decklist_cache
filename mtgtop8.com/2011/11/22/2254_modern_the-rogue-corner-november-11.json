It also utilizes efficient removal like Path to Exile and board wipes like Wrath of God to control the opponent's board. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures while maintaining a strong life total through cards like Ghostly Prison and Elspeth, Knight-Errant to secure victory."
