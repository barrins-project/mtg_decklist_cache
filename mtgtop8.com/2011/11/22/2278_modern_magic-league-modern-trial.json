The deck also aims to generate card advantage through cards like Liliana of the Veil and Thirst for Knowledge, as well as utilizing lands like Grove of the Burnwillows and Eternal Witness to grind out incremental advantages. The deck's win condition typically involves looping Punishing Fire or setting up a powerful Rude Awakening to overwhelm the opponent."
