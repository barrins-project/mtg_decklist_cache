By utilizing cards like Champion of the Parish and Geist of Saint Traft, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence. Support cards like Angelic Destiny and Honor of the Pure enhance the creatures' power and toughness, making them even more difficult for the opponent to deal with. Additionally, cards like Oblivion Ring provide removal options, while cards like Moorland Haunt allow for creature recursion. Ultimately, this deck aims to quickly take control of the game and pressure the opponent into submission."
