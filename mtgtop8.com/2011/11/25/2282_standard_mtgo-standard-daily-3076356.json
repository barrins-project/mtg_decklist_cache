The inclusion of powerful red spells like Shrine of Burning Rage and Chandra's Phoenix further adds to its aggressive strategy, making it difficult for opponents to recover once they fall behind. The deck's fast-paced and relentless approach makes it a formidable opponent in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
