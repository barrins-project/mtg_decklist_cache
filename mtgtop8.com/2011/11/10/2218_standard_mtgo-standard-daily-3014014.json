The inclusion of powerful creatures like Hero of Bladehold and Geist of Saint Traft adds extra punch to the deck. Cards like Gideon's Lawkeeper and Oblivion Ring provide control options to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also includes a few counterspells like Mana Leak for protection. The overall strategy is to swarm the board early and maintain pressure to secure a quick victory."
