The deck aims to disrupt its opponent's game plan by countering key spells, removing threats from the board, and drawing cards to stay ahead in resources. By utilizing cards like Snapcaster Mage for repeated spellcasting and Nephalia Drownyard for mill win condition, the deck seeks to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents in the late game. Overall, the deck aims to control the tempo of the game and grind out a win through attrition."

The inclusion of counterspells like Mana Leak and removal like Oblivion Ring helps to maintain board control and protect your creatures. Geoist of Saint Traft and Angelic Destiny provide additional ways to push damage through."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy using small creatures called \"weenies.\" By quickly building a board presence with cards like Champion of the Parish and Hero of Bladehold, the deck aims to apply pressure and deal damage efficiently. Cards like Honor of the Pure boost the power of the white creatures, while equipment like Sword of War and Peace provides additional benefits and protection. The combination of low-cost creatures and card advantage through cards like Moorland Haunt and Geist of Saint Traft makes this deck a formidable aggro-weanie white archetype."
