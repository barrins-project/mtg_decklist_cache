The Faeries in the deck provide additional ways to disrupt the opponent, while creatures like Noble Hierarch and Birds of Paradise help ramp up mana for powerful spells like Garruk Wildspeaker. This deck aims to outsmart and outmaneuver the opponent through calculated plays and strategic decision-making."
