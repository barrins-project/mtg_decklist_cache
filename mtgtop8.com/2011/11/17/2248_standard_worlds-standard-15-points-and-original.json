Spells like Negate, Mana Leak, and Dissipate help control the opponent's plays. Sword of Feast and Famine can provide additional advantage by untapping lands. Day of Judgment acts as a board wipe, while Oblivion Ring handles problematic permanents. The mana base is balanced between Islands, Plains, and dual lands, with utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Moorland Haunt. Gideon Jura serves as a finisher or protection option."
