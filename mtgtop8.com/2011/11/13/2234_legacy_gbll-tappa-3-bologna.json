The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with these massive threats quickly before they have a chance to stabilize. The deck also includes counter spells like Force of Will and Misdirection to protect the combo pieces. Additionally, there are cards like Brainstorm and Ponder for card selection and consistency. The inclusion of cards like Blood Moon and Wipe Away provide additional disruption and flexibility in different matchups."
