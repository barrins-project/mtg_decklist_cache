By continually recycling lands from the graveyard, the deck can power up cards like Countryside Crusher and Terravore, while also fueling Seismic Assault for direct damage. The deck includes a mix of control elements like Punishing Fire and Chalice of the Void, along with card draw and library manipulation to maintain consistency. Overall, the deck focuses on resource management and strategic use of its land-based abilities to outlast and outmaneuver opponents."
