By utilizing cards like Delver of Secrets, Chandra's Phoenix, and Grim Lavamancer, along with spells like Arc Trail and Incinerate, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Desperate Ravings and Snapcaster Mage allows for card advantage and flexibility in decision-making. Additionally, cards like Mana Leak and Vapor Snag provide disruption and control elements to protect the aggressive game plan."
