It utilizes disruption spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Duress to dismantle the opponent's hand, while removal spells like Doom Blade and Go for the Throat deal with opposing creatures. Lashwrithe enhances the deck's creatures, while cards like Spellskite and Vault Skirge provide additional utility and resilience. The deck aims to grind out victories through attrition and overwhelming the opponent with its threats."
