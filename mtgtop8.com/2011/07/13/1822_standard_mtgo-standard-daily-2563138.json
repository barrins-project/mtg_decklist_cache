It includes a mix of Sword cards for additional effects, alongside Blade Splicer and Hero of Bladehold for additional creature support. Trinket Mage helps search for key artifacts, while Squadron Hawk provides additional card advantage. Mana Leak serves as a form of disruption to control the opponent's plays. The mana base is designed for consistency, with a mix of Plains, Islands, and artifact lands for efficient casting of spells and equipping of equipment."
