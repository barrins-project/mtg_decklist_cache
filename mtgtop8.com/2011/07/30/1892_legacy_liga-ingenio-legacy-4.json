Once the graveyard is stocked, the player can bring back powerful creatures like Ichorid and Narcomoeba using Dread Return and Bridge from Below. This allows for explosive plays and repeated attacks from a variety of creatures, overwhelming the opponent and securing victory through sheer numbers and speed of execution. The deck is focused on creating a strong board presence and closing out the game before the opponent can react effectively."
