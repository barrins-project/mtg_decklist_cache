By manipulating the board state with cards like Stonehorn Dignitary and Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite, the deck can dictate the pace of the game and outvalue the opponent. Additionally, cards like Acidic Slime and Viridian Corrupter provide additional removal options while cards like Sun Titan and Razor Hippogriff offer recursion and value. Venser, the Sojourner provides a powerful way to re-use enter-the-battlefield effects and generate incremental advantage."
