The inclusion of Sword of Feast and Famine helps to pressure opponents and untap lands for more control options. Celestial Colonnade and Inkmoth Nexus serve as win conditions while Gideon Jura and Jace Beleren provide additional control and card advantage. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy, protect its own threats, and eventually close out the game with powerful creatures and equipment."
