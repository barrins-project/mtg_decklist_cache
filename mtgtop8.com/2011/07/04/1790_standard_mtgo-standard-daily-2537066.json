The deck aims to maintain a stable board state with various threats like Grave Titan and Wurmcoil Engine, while also using land destruction and land manipulation to hinder the opponent's mana development. By controlling the game and slowly wearing down the opponent's resources, the deck seeks to establish dominance and secure a win through strategic decision-making and careful resource management."

            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to utilize the combo of Deceiver Exarch and Splinter Twin to create an infinite loop of creature tokens. The deck includes cards like Lightning Bolt and Mana Leak for control, as well as card draw options like Preordain and Sea Gate Oracle. The mana base is focused on providing the right color requirements for the combo pieces. Overall, the deck aims to assemble the combo quickly and protect it until victory is achieved."

By efficiently removing threats and dealing direct damage, the deck aims to control the board and lower the opponent's life total as fast as possible. The combination of efficient creatures and removal spells allows for a strong early game presence and the ability to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The mana base is built to support the aggressive strategy, with a mix of lands that allow for consistent access to both black and red mana sources."
