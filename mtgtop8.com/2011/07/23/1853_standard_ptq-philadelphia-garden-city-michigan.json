With aggressive creatures like Signal Pest and Vault Skirge, supported by Steel Overseer for additional counters, the deck aims to quickly outpace the opponent and deal lethal damage. Dispatch and Spellskite provide removal and protection, while cards like Glint Hawk Idol and Preordain help maintain card advantage and tempo. The deck also includes mana acceleration with Mox Opal and Origin Spellbomb to ensure a fast start."
