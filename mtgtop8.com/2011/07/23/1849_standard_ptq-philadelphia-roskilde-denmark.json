By utilizing low-cost artifact creatures and strong support cards like Steel Overseer and Dispatch, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain board control. The inclusion of Inkmoth Nexus provides an alternative win condition by turning into a flying infect creature. Contested War Zone helps to further boost the deck's aggressive strategy by giving bonus damage to attacking creatures."
