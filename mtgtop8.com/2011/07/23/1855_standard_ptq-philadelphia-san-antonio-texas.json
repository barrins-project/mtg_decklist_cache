The key strategy involves controlling the board with removal spells like Dismember and Lightning Bolt, while maintaining pressure with early creatures like Goblin Guide and Grim Lavamancer. The deck also capitalizes on landfall triggers with cards like Searing Blaze and Shrine of Burning Rage to further increase damage output. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with constant aggression and burn damage."
