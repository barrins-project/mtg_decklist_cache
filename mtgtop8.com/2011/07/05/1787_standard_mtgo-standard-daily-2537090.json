It also includes card draw and library manipulation to maintain card advantage, as well as land destruction to disrupt the opponent's mana base. This deck aims to slowly grind out the opponent's resources while limiting their options and ultimately securing victory through superior card advantage and powerful threats."

            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the game by ramping up mana, using cards like Cultivate, Explore, and Harrow to accelerate into powerful threats like Primeval Titan and Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle. These threats can quickly overwhelm the opponent with damage from Valakut triggers or massive creatures like Avenger of Zendikar and Inferno Titan. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by efficiently ramping and controlling the board, eventually overpowering them with big plays and strong endgame threats."
