The deck focuses on getting out Primeval Titan to search for Valakut and other lands, while also using cards like Cultivate, Harrow, and Khalni Heart Expedition to accelerate mana production. With strong control elements like Lightning Bolt and Inferno Titan, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats and burn spells."
