Removal spells like Go for the Throat and Lightning Bolt help to clear the way for attacks, while disruptive cards like Despise and Duress hinder the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of Viscera Seer allows for some deck manipulation and synergizes well with the sacrifice effects of cards like Bloodghast and Gatekeeper of Malakir. With a solid mana base and a curve that maximizes efficiency, this deck is designed to apply constant pressure and close out games quickly."

By using cards like Mana Leak, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Duress to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also having removal spells like Doom Blade and Black Sun's Zenith to deal with threats, the deck aims to maintain control of the board. Additionally, card advantage is gained through the use of Jace Beleren, Liliana Vess, and Preordain to ensure a steady stream of resources and answers to the opponent's threats."
