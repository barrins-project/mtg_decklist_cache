Key cards like Elvish Archdruid and Fauna Shaman help ramp up your mana production and find your powerful threats like Vengevine and Ezuri, Renegade Leader. Additionally, the inclusion of Tectonic Edge and Acidic Slime can disrupt your opponent's mana base, while Garruk Wildspeaker and Eldrazi Monument provide additional threats and ways to close out the game."
