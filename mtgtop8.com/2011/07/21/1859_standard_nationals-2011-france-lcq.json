It also includes disruptive cards like Mana Leak, Spell Pierce, and Mental Misstep to control the game. The deck also features card draw and filtering with Preordain, Jace Beleren, and Gitaxian Probe to help find key combo pieces. With a mix of control elements, card advantage, and a powerful combo finish, this deck aims to out-tempo and out-value opponents in a 1v1 Standard format."
