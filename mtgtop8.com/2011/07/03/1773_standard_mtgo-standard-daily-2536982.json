The deck includes protection in the form of Spellskite and counterspells like Mana Leak and Spell Pierce. Jace Beleren and Consecrated Sphinx provide card advantage while Sea Gate Oracle filters the deck. Tectonic Edge deals with problematic lands while Scalding Tarn fetches the necessary colors of mana. Efficient cantrips like Preordain and Gitaxian Probe help to find the combo pieces quickly for a powerful win condition."
