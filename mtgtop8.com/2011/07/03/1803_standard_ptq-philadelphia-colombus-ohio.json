            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to use control elements to slowly build up resources and disrupt the opponent's game plan, while using Tezzeret as the win condition. By using cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Duress to disrupt the opponent's hand, along with cards like Spellskite and Sphere of the Suns to control the board, the deck aims to buy time until it can assemble the necessary components to bring out powerful threats like Blightsteel Colossus or Myr Battlesphere. The deck's mana base is optimized to support Tezzeret's abilities and ensure consistency in casting spells."
