It aims to control the board with cards like Day of Judgment and Journey to Nowhere, while using Jace Beleren and Gideon Jura to generate card advantage and protect itself. The deck also utilizes manlands like Celestial Colonnade for additional win conditions. Overall, the deck is designed to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
