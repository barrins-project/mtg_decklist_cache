By efficiently using damage-dealing cards like Lightning Bolt and Searing Blaze, combined with creatures like Goblin Guide and Kiln Fiend, the goal is to reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can stabilize. The powerful planeswalker Koth of the Hammer provides additional support and card advantage, while Shrine of Burning Rage steadily increases in power to become a lethal threat. The mana base is optimized for speed and consistency to ensure a swift victory."
