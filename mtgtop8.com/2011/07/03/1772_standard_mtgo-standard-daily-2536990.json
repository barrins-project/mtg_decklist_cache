By utilizing a mix of mana acceleration, value creatures, and versatile cards like Birthing Pod and Mimic Vat, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent by maintaining board control and generating incremental advantage over time. The strategy revolves around leveraging the versatility of Birthing Pod to adapt to different game states and match-ups, ultimately allowing the player to dictate the pace of the game."
