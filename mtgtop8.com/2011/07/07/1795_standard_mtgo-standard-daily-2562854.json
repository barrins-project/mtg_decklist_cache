Once Valakut is online, the goal is to trigger its ability multiple times in a turn by playing multiple Mountains and dealing damage to the opponent's creatures or life total. Primeval Titan and Avenger of Zendikar provide additional win conditions and ways to ramp up mana quickly. The deck also includes cards like Cultivate, Explore, and Harrow to accelerate the mana base and ensure efficient land drops."
