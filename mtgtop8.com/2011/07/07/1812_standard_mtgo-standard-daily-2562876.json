The deck achieves this through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw. It aims to control the battlefield with cards like Day of Judgment and Condemn, while also generating advantage through cards like Jace Beleren and Preordain. The deck's win condition is to eventually overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Baneslayer Angel and Sun Titan, while also having options for disruption with counterspells like Mana Leak and Spell Pierce."

The deck also utilizes removal spells like Go for the Throat and Doom Blade to deal with threats on the board. Tectonic Edge and Spreading Seas provide additional disruption by targeting your opponent's lands. The goal is to control the game by consistently answering threats and drawing into more powerful late-game plays like Karn Liberated and Wurmcoil Engine to secure the win."
