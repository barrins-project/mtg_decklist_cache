The deck aims to control the board through cards like Grave Titan and Wurmcoil Engine while keeping the opponent from executing their game plan using cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Mana Leak. Additionally, the deck has card advantage options with Preordain, Jace Beleren, and Liliana Vess to outvalue the opponent and ultimately secure victory."
