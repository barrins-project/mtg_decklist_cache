            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to create a powerful combo by using Deceiver Exarch and Splinter Twin to create multiple token copies of Deceiver Exarch with haste, allowing for a quick and devastating win condition. The deck also includes cards for control and card draw to help set up the combo and protect it once it's in play. Tectonic Edge helps with land disruption and allows for a more strategic approach to the game. Overall, the deck is designed to quickly assemble the combo and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to respond effectively."
