By utilizing cards like Glint Hawk and Kor Skyfisher to bounce back cheap artifacts like Memnite and Ornithopter, the deck aims to trigger the Quest for the Holy Relic quickly to bring out powerful equipment like Argentum Armor and Batterskull. Puresteel Paladin helps to reduce the equip costs, while Spellskite protects key creatures. Dispatch and Contagion Clasp provide removal options, while Sword of War and Peace offers additional damage and protection. The mana base includes utility lands like Tectonic Edge for disruption."
