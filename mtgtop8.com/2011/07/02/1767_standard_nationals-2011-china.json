The deck also focuses on card advantage and card selection with cards like Jace Beleren and Preordain. The inclusion of land destruction with Tectonic Edge complements the control strategy by limiting the opponent's resources. Overall, this deck aims to establish control of the game and slowly grind out a victory."
