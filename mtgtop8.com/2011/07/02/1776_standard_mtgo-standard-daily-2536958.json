The win condition of the deck revolves around grinding down the opponent's resources with efficient removal spells and finish them off with powerful late-game threats like Grave Titan and Wurmcoil Engine. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and outvalue them over the course of the game, ultimately coming out on top through attrition."
