The deck focuses on playing powerful creatures like Primeval Titan and Avenger of Zendikar to maintain board presence and overwhelm opponents. Additionally, cards like Burst Lightning and Summoning Trap provide removal and potential for explosive plays. Overall, the deck aims to outpace opponents through powerful ramp strategies and utilize Valakut's ability to close out games efficiently."
