The deck aims to control the board with cards like Day of Judgment and Oblivion Ring while also drawing cards and generating advantage with cards like Jace Beleren and Consecrated Sphinx. It also includes a variety of win conditions such as Elspeth Tirel and Sun Titan to close out the game. With a mix of disruption, card advantage, and strong finishers, this deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a long game."
