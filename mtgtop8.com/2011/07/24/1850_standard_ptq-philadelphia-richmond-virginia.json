The deck aims to stall the game with counter spells like Mana Leak and Spell Pierce, remove threats with cards like Dismember and Day of Judgment, and generate tokens with cards like Squadron Hawk and Emeria Angel. The deck can also close out the game with powerful finishers like Consecrated Sphinx and Sword of Feast and Famine. The mana base consists of a mix of lands that provide multiple colors and utility options."
