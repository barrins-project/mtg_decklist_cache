By utilizing a mix of creature removal spells like Go for the Throat and Doom Blade, countermagic like Mana Leak and Negate, and card draw engines like Jace Beleren and Consecrated Sphinx, the deck aims to outvalue opponents and keep the board clear. With a solid mana base and versatile threats like Grave Titan, the deck seeks to outlast the opponent and eventually overwhelm them with powerful creatures."
