Squadron Hawk helps with card advantage, while Sun Titan can bring back key permanents from the graveyard. The deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a dominant board presence with its threats and protect them with its control elements. This deck thrives on out-valuing opponents and grinding out victories through attrition."
