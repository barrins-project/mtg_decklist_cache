The land base is carefully crafted to allow for consistent mana fixing and to fuel the card draw spells. In summary, this deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and unleash devastating spells on the opponent."

The deck includes control elements such as Dispel and Mana Leak to protect the combo, while also including card draw spells like Ponder and Preordain to dig for key pieces. The inclusion of Spellskite helps protect the combo from removal spells, making it difficult for opponents to disrupt the game plan. Shrine of Piercing Vision helps with card selection, and the mana base is optimized for consistency with fetch lands and cantrips."
