Steel Overseer further enhances their strength, while Spellskite provides protection. The inclusion of cards like Mox Opal and Glint Hawk Idol help in accelerating mana production and creating additional threats. By aggressively attacking with a swarm of powered-up creatures, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents and secure a fast victory."
