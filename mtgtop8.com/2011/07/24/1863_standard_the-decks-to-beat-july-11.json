It includes a variety of tools to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also generating card advantage with draw spells like Jace's Ingenuity and Jace Beleren. The win condition of the deck is typically White Sun's Zenith, creating a board of token creatures to finish off the opponent. The deck also includes some powerful planeswalkers like Karn Liberated for additional control and threat. Overall, the key strategy is to control the game until the opponent is overwhelmed by card advantage and threats."
