The deck aims to stall the game with cards like Tumble Magnet and Wall of Omens before dropping powerful finishers like Gideon Jura and Karn Liberated. It also provides additional control and flexibility with planeswalkers like Elspeth Tirel and Venser, the Sojourner. Celestial Colonnade and Glacial Fortress serve as backup win conditions."

The deck uses a combination of spot removal like Dismember and Oblivion Ring, along with board wipes like Day of Judgment to keep the opponent's creatures in check. The mana base is designed to support a consistent mana curve, allowing the player to hit their crucial land drops and cast their powerful spells on time."
