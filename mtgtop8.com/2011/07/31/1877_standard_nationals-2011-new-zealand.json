The inclusion of Spellskite provides protection for key pieces like Sword of Feast and Famine. The deck also utilizes a mix of counterspells, removal, and card draw to control the pace of the game. The Plains and Island serve as the mana base for the deck, supported by dual lands like Seachrome Coast and Glacial Fortress. Additionally, the deck includes planeswalkers like Gideon Jura and Jace Beleren for additional control and card advantage."
