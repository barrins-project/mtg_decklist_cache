            "notes": "This deck focuses on assembling the Splinter Twin combo, using Deceiver Exarch to create infinite tokens with haste. The deck includes disruptive elements like Spellskite and counterspells to protect the combo, while cantrips like Gitaxian Probe and Ponder help find key pieces. Shrine of Piercing Vision provides card selection, and Into the Roil can deal with problematic permanents. The mana base is streamlined with Scalding Tarn and includes a mix of Islands and Mountains to support the combo and control elements."
