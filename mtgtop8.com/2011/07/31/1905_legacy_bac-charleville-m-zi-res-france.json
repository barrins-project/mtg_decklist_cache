The deck also aims to utilize the power of Natural Order to search for and put Progenitus into play, providing a powerful win condition. The deck can control the board with cards like Vendilion Clique and Tarmogoyf, while also having burn spells like Lightning Bolt for direct damage. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."

These creatures are high-impact threats that can quickly close out the game, such as Blazing Archon, Elesh Norn, and Sphinx of the Steel Wind. The deck also includes powerful disruption spells like Force of Will and Daze to protect its combo and control the opponent's plays. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with huge creatures and disrupt their game plan to secure victory."
