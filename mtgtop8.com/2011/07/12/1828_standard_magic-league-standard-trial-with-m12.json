By casting cantrips like Preordain and Ponder, as well as Gitaxian Probe and See Beyond, the deck is able to quickly fill the graveyard and activate Pyromancer Ascension. Mana Leak provides control over the opponent's spells, while Tezzeret's Gambit can proliferate the Ascension counters for even more powerful spells. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of powerful, doubled spells."
