The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Force of Will and Swords to Plowshares, while also drawing cards and gaining card advantage with Brainstorm and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The inclusion of cards like Spellstutter Sprite and Vendilion Clique also allows for disruption of the opponent's spells and creatures. Additionally, the deck can quickly close out the game with powerful equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine."
