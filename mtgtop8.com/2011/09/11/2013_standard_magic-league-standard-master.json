            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to control the game by using a combination of creature removal, counterspells, and card advantage. The deck aims to maintain board control through cards like Consecrated Sphinx, Thrun, the Last Troll, and Skinshifter, while also ramping up its mana with Birds of Paradise and Lotus Cobra. It utilizes spells like Dismember, Spell Pierce, and Mana Leak to counter and remove threats, and has access to card draw and token generation through Garruk, Primal Hunter. Sword of Feast and Famine provides additional protection and mana advantage. The land base is designed for flexibility and fetching."
