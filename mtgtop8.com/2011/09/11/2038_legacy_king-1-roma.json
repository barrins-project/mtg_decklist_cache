            "notes": "The deck is focused on playing low-cost artifact creatures quickly and using them in combination with other artifacts to quickly overwhelm the opponent. The key strategy involves using Cranial Plating to buff up the creatures and make them difficult to deal with, while using cards like Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas and Thoughtcast to draw more cards and maintain card advantage. Pithing Needle is used to disrupt the opponent's key cards or strategies, while Dispatch provides removal when needed. The mana base is optimized for quickly casting the deck's low-cost artifacts."
