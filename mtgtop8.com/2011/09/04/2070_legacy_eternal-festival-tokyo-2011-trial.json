The inclusion of cards like Magus of the Moon can disrupt opponent's mana base, while powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Elspeth, Knight-Errant can provide additional value. The equipment package with Swords and Batterskull offer good ways to close out the game. The deck is designed to disrupt opponent's plans while establishing a dominating board presence."
