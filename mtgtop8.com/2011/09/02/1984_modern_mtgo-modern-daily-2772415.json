The deck aims to control the game with its big threats and mana advantage."

By utilizing mana dorks and card draw, the deck aims to ramp into big threats like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn or Regal Force to overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of combo pieces like Nettle Sentinel and Heritage Druid allows for explosive turns and the ability to search for specific creatures with Green Sun's Zenith. Overall, the deck aims to control the board and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful Elf synergy."
