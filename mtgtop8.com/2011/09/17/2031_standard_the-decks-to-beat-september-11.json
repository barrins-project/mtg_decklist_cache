The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Mana Leak, while generating card advantage with cards like Jace Beleren and Consecrated Sphinx. The deck also includes powerful win conditions such as Grave Titan and Karn Liberated to close out the game once the opponent has been sufficiently disrupted. Overall, the deck seeks to control the pace of the game and outmaneuver the opponent to secure victory."
