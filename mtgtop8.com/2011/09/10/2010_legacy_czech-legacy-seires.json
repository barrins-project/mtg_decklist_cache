By using Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play, along with lords like Lord of Atlantis and Merrow Reejerey to buff them, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly. Daze, Force of Will, and Mental Misstep provide protection and disruption to keep the opponent off balance. Mutavault and Wasteland offer additional utility in mana denial and extra creature threats. The deck's synergy and efficient spell choices make it a formidable opponent in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
