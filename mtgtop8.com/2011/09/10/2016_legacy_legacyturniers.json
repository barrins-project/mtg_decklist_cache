The deck also includes protection cards like Force of Will and Misdirection to defend the combo pieces. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and win the game quickly before they have a chance to respond. Additionally, cards like Brainstorm and Ponder help to set up the combo and find the necessary pieces."
