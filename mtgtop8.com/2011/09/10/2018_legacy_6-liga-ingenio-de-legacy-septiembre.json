This deck aims to outvalue the opponent and disrupt their game plan through tempo plays and card advantage, all while having a solid mana base to support the various colored spells and lands to combat opposing strategies. The inclusion of card draw engines like Dark Confidant and Sensei's Divining Top further enhances this deck's ability to maintain control of the game."
