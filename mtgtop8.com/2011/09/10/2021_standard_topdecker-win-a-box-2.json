The key strategy is to establish board control with efficient creatures like Mirran Crusader while disrupting opponents' strategies with counterspells like Mana Leak and Spell Pierce. The deck also includes equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine and Sword of War and Peace to strengthen its creatures and protect them from removal. Gideon Jura provides additional control options, while land destruction from Tectonic Edge can disrupt opponents' mana base."
