By getting out creatures like Glint Hawk Idol and Signal Pest early, alongside powerful threats like Hero of Bladehold and Blade Splicer, the deck aims to apply fast and consistent pressure to the opponent. Additionally, the inclusion of utility cards like Dispatch and Contested War Zone helps to provide additional avenues for victory."
