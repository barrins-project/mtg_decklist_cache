The goal is to disrupt the opponent's strategy while slowly building up a board presence with cards like Squadron Hawk and Emeria Angel. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Consecrated Sphinx and Sun Titan helps to close out the game once the opponent has been neutralized. The deck also utilizes land destruction with cards like Tectonic Edge to further control the pace of the game. With a mix of control elements and threats, this deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent."
