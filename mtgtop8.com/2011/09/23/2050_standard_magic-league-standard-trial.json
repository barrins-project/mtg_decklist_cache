It includes a variety of removal spells, counterspells, and card draw to maintain card advantage. The deck also utilizes graveyard recursion through cards like Unburial Rites to bring back powerful creatures like Sun Titan and Wurmcoil Engine. The combination of efficient removal, counterspells, card advantage, and powerful finishers allows the deck to outlast opponents and eventually overwhelm them with its threats."
