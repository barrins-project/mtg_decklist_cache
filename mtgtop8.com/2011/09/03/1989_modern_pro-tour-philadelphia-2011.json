By enchanting one of these creatures with Splinter Twin, it creates an infinite token combo that allows for a win condition. The deck also includes control elements such as counterspells and removal to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base is designed to support a wide variety of colors to ensure consistent access to the necessary cards for the combo."
