The deck utilizes various card draw and searching spells to find the key pieces needed to win the game in a fast and efficient manner. Disrupting Shoal and Spell Pierce provide protection while Dragonstorm can also be used as an alternate win condition. Overall, the goal is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a powerful combo before they can respond effectively."
