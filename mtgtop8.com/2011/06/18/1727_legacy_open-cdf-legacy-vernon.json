This is achieved by using cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Standstill to generate card advantage, along with efficient removal spells like Go for the Throat and Pernicious Deed. The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's mana base with cards like Wasteland and Mishra's Factory, while also having access to powerful counter magic like Counterspell and Force of Will to protect its own game plan."
