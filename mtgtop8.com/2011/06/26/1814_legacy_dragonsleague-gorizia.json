Supporting cards like Kira, Great Glass-Spinner and Cursecatcher provide protection and disruption against spells. The deck also includes counterspells like Daze, Force of Will, and Mental Misstep to control the opponent's actions. Aether Vial allows for creatures to be played at instant speed, while Mutavault and Wasteland provide additional utility and land destruction. The overall goal is to establish board presence quickly and maintain pressure on the opponent to secure victory."
