The creatures in the deck, such as Dark Confidant and Stoneforge Mystic, are used to apply pressure and close out the game quickly. The inclusion of equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Body and Mind helps to further the aggro strategy by providing additional threats and value. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive and disruptive plan."

The deck aims to quickly generate a strong board presence and deal damage efficiently, taking advantage of the affinity mechanic to reduce the cost of artifacts. The inclusion of Tezzeret and Thoughtcast provides card advantage and additional ways to enhance the artifacts' power."
