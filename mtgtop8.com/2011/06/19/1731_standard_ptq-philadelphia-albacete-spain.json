By playing aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide and Steppe Lynx, along with powerful equipment like Sword of War and Peace, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Cards like Koth of the Hammer and Lightning Bolt provide additional removal and reach to help seal the victory. Overall, the deck focuses on fast, aggressive plays to overwhelm the opponent and finish the game quickly."
