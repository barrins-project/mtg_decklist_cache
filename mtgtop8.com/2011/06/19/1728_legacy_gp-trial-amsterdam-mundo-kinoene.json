The key strategy is to control the board with cards like Lord of Atlantis and Merrow Reejerey, while using Aether Vial to cheat out creatures. The creatures work together to beat down the opponent while also providing utility such as tapping down blockers. The deck aims to win by overwhelming the opponent with a fast and aggressive game plan."
