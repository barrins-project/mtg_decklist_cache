The deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor alongside equipment like Stoneforge Mystic to provide threats and answers at the same time. The inclusion of Celestial Colonnade and Inkmoth Nexus as win conditions highlights the deck's ability to adapt to different board states. The deck's overall strategy is to maintain board control, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and ultimately win through incremental advantage."

The deck aims to slow down the opponent's aggression with cards like Torpor Orb and Black Sun's Zenith, while also generating card advantage with Jace Beleren and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The win condition of the deck is to either beat down the opponent with Creeping Tar Pit or Inkmoth Nexus, or close out the game with powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine."
