It also utilizes cards like Squadron Hawk and Stoneforge Mystic to search and put powerful equipment onto the battlefield, such as Sword of Feast and Famine and Batterskull. The goal is to outvalue the opponent with card advantage and efficient removal while setting up win conditions with powerful equipment and finishers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Celestial Colonnade. The deck aims to maintain board control and steadily chip away at the opponent's life total until victory."

The deck also includes a mix of removal spells such as Lightning Bolt and Go for the Throat to deal with opposing threats.
