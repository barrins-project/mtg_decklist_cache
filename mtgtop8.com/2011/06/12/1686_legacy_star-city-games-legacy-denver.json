By resolving Hive Mind, the deck forces the opponent to copy any spells they cast, potentially putting them in an unwinnable situation. The deck also includes key interaction pieces like Force of Will and Pact of Negation to protect the combo. The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up a game-winning combo as quickly as possible."

This triggers a recursive loop with Dread Return to bring back Karmic Guide, which in turn brings back the Illusionist for even more milling. The deck also includes other cards like Cabal Therapy and Venser, Shaper Savant for disruption and control. The deck aims to establish a quick and consistent combo to win the game swiftly."
