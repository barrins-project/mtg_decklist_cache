This is supported by the card advantage from Stoneforge Mystic and Squadron Hawk, while also having the flexibility to take advantage of multiple win conditions, including creature damage, direct damage, and mill with Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent for a decisive victory."

With the synergy between the elves and the various creature abilities, this deck can quickly close out games and outpace slower strategies."
