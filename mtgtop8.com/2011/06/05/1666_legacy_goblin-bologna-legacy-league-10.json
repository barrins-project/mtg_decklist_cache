            "notes": "The deck focuses on using aggressive Merfolk creatures to quickly overwhelm opponents. By utilizing key creatures such as Coralhelm Commander, Lord of Atlantis, and Merrow Reejerey, it aims to establish a strong board presence early in the game. With disruptive spells like Daze, Force of Will, and Mental Misstep, it aims to control the game and protect its creatures. Aether Vial and Standstill provide additional utility and card advantage. With a mana base focused on Islands and utility lands like Mutavault and Wasteland, the deck aims to be fast and efficient in executing its game plan."
