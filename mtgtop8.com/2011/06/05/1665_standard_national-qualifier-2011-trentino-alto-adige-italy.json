Kalastria Highborn and Gatekeeper of Malakir provide additional value and disruption, while Viscera Seer and Vampire Hexmage offer flexibility and synergy with other cards. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistent plays and powerful late-game threats like Hero of Oxid Ridge."

By utilizing pump spells like Mutagenic Growth, Groundswell, and Vines of Vastwood, the deck can further increase the damage output of these infect creatures. Cards like Livewire Lash and Distortion Strike also help in boosting the infect damage dealt. The mana base includes lands like Misty Rainforest and Inkmoth Nexus to ensure consistency in casting the cards needed to achieve victory."
