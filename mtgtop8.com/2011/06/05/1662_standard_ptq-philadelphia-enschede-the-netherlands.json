By playing mana dorks like Birds of Paradise and Lotus Cobra, and equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine and Batterskull, the deck seeks to quickly ramp up and overwhelm opponents with powerful threats. The inclusion of Squadron Hawk provides additional card advantage, while Acidic Slime helps disrupt opponents' game plans. The versatility of the deck lies in its ability to adapt to various matchups and scenarios."
