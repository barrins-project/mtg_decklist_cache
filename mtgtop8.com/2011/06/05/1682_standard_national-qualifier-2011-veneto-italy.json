The deck also includes powerful finishers like Sun Titan, Batterskull, and the Sword equipment to quickly close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. With a mix of card draw, removal, and efficient threats, the deck aims to maintain board control and outvalue the opponent in a longer game. Additionally, the inclusion of planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura provides additional sources of card advantage and disruption."

It also includes control elements like Mana Leak and Spell Pierce to protect the combo, as well as card draw options like Jace Beleren and Preordain to help find key pieces. Additionally, Inferno Titan provides a strong finisher option if the combo is not immediately available.
