By using cards like Mana Leak, Go for the Throat, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Duress, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining card advantage through cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Preordain. The deck also includes finishers like Grave Titan and Consecrated Sphinx to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been sufficiently depleted."
