Additionally, Cabal Therapy helps disrupt your opponent's strategy while cards like Tireless Tribe provide a backup win condition."

The deck also aims to search for key cards with Green Sun's Zenith and Ponder, while also utilizing card advantage with Brainstorm. Another key aspect is the ability to quickly find and play powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf and Noble Hierarch through Natural Order. Additionally, the deck has access to strong finishers like Progenitus and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to close out the game."
