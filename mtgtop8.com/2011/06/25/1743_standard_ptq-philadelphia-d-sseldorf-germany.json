This combo is supported by control elements like Mana Leak, Spell Pierce, and Lightning Bolt to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes card draw and filtering with Preordain and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to help find the combo pieces quickly. Other cards like Sea Gate Oracle and Inferno Titan provide additional value and flexibility in different matchups."
