By establishing early board control with Squadron Hawk and Stoneforge Mystic, the deck aims to stall the opponent's aggression and eventually win the game through card advantage with Jace, the Mind Sculptor and card advantage engines like Consecrated Sphinx. The inclusion of powerful equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine also provides additional win conditions. With a strong mana base and versatile spells, this deck is built to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a 1 vs 1 setting."
