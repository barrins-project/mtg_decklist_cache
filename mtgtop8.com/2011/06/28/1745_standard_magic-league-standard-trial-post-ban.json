Use counterspells such as Mana Leak and Stoic Rebuttal to protect your own threats like Grave Titan and Consecrated Sphinx. Utilize card advantage through Jace Beleren and Liliana Vess to outvalue your opponent, while also having access to versatile options like Blue Sun's Zenith and Black Sun's Zenith for additional control and win conditions."
