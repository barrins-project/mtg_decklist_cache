            "notes": "The main focus of this UW Control deck is to maintain control of the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan by using counterspells, removal spells, and card draw. The deck leverages efficient threats like Celestial Colonnade and Consecrated Sphinx while also using planeswalkers like Venser, the Sojourner and Gideon Jura to generate value and win the game. The deck's land base and removal package help to stall the game until it can establish a dominant position and close out the game with its powerful threats."
