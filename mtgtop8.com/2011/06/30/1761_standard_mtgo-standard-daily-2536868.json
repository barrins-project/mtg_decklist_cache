The mana base is designed to support the control strategy with a mix of lands that provide colored mana and utility, ensuring the deck can consistently cast its spells and disrupt the opponent's strategy."

The deck aims to control the game by managing the opponent's threats, maintaining board presence with powerful finishers like Grave Titan and Wurmcoil Engine, and disrupting the opponent's mana base with cards like Spreading Seas and Tectonic Edge. Overall, the deck seeks to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent to secure a win through attrition and resource management."
