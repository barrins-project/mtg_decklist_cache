The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on by playing powerful creatures like Goblin Guide and Plated Geopede, while also utilizing burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Burst Lightning to finish off the opponent. Cards like Koth of the Hammer and Shrine of Burning Rage help to increase the damage output and close out the game swiftly, making it a formidable force in the aggressive playstyle."
