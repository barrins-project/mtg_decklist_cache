By using mana acceleration from cards like Llanowar Elves and Birds of Paradise, it can get ahead in the early game and start equipping powerful swords like Sword of Feast and Famine and Sword of Body and Mind to deal massive damage. Thrun, the Last Troll and Wurmcoil Engine provide resilient threats that are difficult for the opponent to deal with. Stoneforge Mystic helps tutor for the necessary equipment while Squadron Hawk provides card advantage."

By using a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura, the deck aims to control the game while gradually building up its own board presence. The inclusion of powerful equipment like Sword of Body and Mind and Baneslayer Angel provides additional threats and advantages. With a strong mana base and a variety of versatile spells, this deck is designed to outlast opponents and secure victory through strategic control of the game."
