By ramping up mana using cards like Explore, Cultivate, and Harrow, the deck aims to quickly reach the necessary conditions to deal massive amounts of direct damage with Valakut triggers. Additionally, cards like Avenger of Zendikar and Oracle of Mul Daya are included to provide additional threats and card advantage to outvalue the opponent in the late game."
