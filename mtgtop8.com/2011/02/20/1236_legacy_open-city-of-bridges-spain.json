The deck utilizes the Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top combo to control the top of the opponent's deck, while also including powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf and Rhox War Monk to apply pressure. The deck can quickly ramp into a game-ending threat with Natural Order, and has the flexibility to adapt to various strategies with a mix of removal and counter spells. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while establishing a dominant board presence."
