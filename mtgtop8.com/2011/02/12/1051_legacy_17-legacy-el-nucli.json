By playing aggressive creatures like Kird Ape, Wild Nacatl, and Tarmogoyf, along with powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can establish their own board presence. The inclusion of cards like Knight of the Reliquary and Qasali Pridemage provide additional utility and disruption, making it a versatile and proactive strategy."
