The deck aims to establish board control with creatures like Grave Titan and Creeping Tar Pit while using Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Jace Beleren to generate card advantage and control the pace of the game. The deck also utilizes land disruption with cards like Spreading Seas and Tectonic Edge to further disrupt the opponent's resources. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game and out-valuing the opponent to secure victory."
