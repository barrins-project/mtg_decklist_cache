The deck aims to use Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle as a win condition by getting multiple Mountain cards onto the battlefield to deal damage to the opponent's creatures and eventually to their face. Cards like Harrow and Explore help to thin out the deck and find key pieces while Lightning Bolt and Pyroclasm provide removal and board control."
