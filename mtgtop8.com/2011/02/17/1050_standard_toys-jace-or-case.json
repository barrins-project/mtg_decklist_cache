The deck aims to stabilize the board with cards like Day of Judgment and Journey to Nowhere, while generating card advantage with Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Jace Beleren. The win condition is to either outvalue the opponent with Sun Titan recurring threats or generate a large board presence with White Sun's Zenith. The deck also includes utility lands like Celestial Colonnade and Tectonic Edge to further control the game."
