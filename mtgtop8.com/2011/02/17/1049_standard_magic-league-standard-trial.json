With cards like Goblin Guide, Kargan Dragonlord, and Plated Geopede leading the charge, supported by burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Searing Blaze, the deck aims to finish the game swiftly before the opponent can establish a strong defense. Additionally, control elements like Tectonic Edge and Molten-Tail Masticore provide additional disruption and flexibility in dealing with opposing threats."
