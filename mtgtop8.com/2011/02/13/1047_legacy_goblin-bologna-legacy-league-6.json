The deck also includes versatile threats like Vendilion Clique and Tarmogoyf to apply pressure and close out the game. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while establishing a dominant position on the battlefield."

The deck utilizes creatures like Knight of the Reliquary, Qasali Pridemage, and Rhox War Monk for pressure and disruption. The mana base is designed to support all the color requirements of the spells in the deck. The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up your own win conditions for victory in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
