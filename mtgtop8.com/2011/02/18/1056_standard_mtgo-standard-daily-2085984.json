The deck aims to ramp up mana early with cards like Lotus Cobra and Birds of Paradise to power out high-cost creatures like Hero of Bladehold and Linvala, Keeper of Silence. Lead the Stampede helps to refill the hand with creatures to keep up the pressure on the opponent. The mix of creatures and mana ramp ensures a fast-paced and overwhelming assault on the opponent."
