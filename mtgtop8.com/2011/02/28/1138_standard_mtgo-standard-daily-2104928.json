Once Valakut is active, playing multiple Mountains with cards like Primeval Titan and Harrow triggers its ability to deal quick and consistent damage to the opponent's creatures or life total. Avenger of Zendikar and Oracle of Mul Daya provide additional value and board presence, while Summoning Trap can be used to cheat out high-cost threats for a game-winning advantage."
