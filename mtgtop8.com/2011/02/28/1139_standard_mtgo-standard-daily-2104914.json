The deck functions by using cards like Squadron Hawk and Stoneforge Mystic to search for key pieces, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura to control the board. The deck also includes a mix of counterspells and board wipes to keep the opponent's threats in check, while also providing some lifegain and utility with Sylvok Lifestaff."
