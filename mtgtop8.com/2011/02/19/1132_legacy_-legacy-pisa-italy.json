Tezzeret the Seeker can search for key artifacts, while cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Humility can help stall the game and protect against aggressive strategies. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game and winning through incremental advantage."

Additionally, the deck has powerful support cards like Stoneforge Mystic, Thrun, the Last Troll, and Sylvan Library to provide additional versatility and resilience in the face of opposing threats. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's aggressive game plan while also providing flexibility and consistency."
