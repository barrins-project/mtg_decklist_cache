            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game through various means such as removal, hand disruption, and card advantage. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while establishing a strong board presence with creatures like Acidic Slime, Birds of Paradise, and Vengevine. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Stoneforge Mystic to generate card advantage and search for key pieces like Sword of Feast and Famine. The deck utilizes ramp and mana fixing cards like Lotus Cobra and Verdant Catacombs to ensure a smooth mana curve and consistent gameplay."
