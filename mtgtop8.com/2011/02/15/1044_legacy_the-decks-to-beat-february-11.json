It also uses burn spells like Lightning Bolt and removal like Swords to Plowshares to clear the way for its creatures. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Ajani Vengeant and Elspeth, Knight-Errant provide additional threats and utility, making it a well-rounded and adaptable deck in Legacy 1 vs 1 format."

The key to its strategy lies in utilizing Aether Vial to cheat in Merfolk creatures at instant speed while controlling the opponent's resources with counterspells. Standstill provides card advantage while delaying the opponent's game plan. Lord of Atlantis boosts the power of all Merfolk creatures, while Coralhelm Commander and Merrow Reejerey provide additional synergy and support for the overall aggressive strategy. The deck aims to outpace and overwhelm the opponent with a quick and resilient board presence."
