The deck also includes powerful equipment like the Sword of Feast and Famine and Sword of Body and Mind, along with support cards like Goblin Guide and Stoneforge Mystic to enhance the deck's aggro capabilities."

The deck also utilizes land disruption with cards like Spreading Seas and Tectonic Edge to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the strategy revolves around outlasting the opponent and seizing control of the game."
