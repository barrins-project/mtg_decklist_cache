            "notes": "The main idea of this Aggro - MUD deck is to ramp up mana quickly and play powerful artifacts that can disrupt opponent's strategies while also putting pressure on them. Cards like Metalworker and Mox Diamond help generate mana early on, while cards like Lodestone Golem and Wurmcoil Engine create big threats on the board. The deck also includes ways to protect its key creatures, such as Lightning Greaves and Goblin Welder. With a mix of artifact acceleration and disruptive creatures, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its efficient plays and strong board presence."
