By controlling the board and countering opponent's spells, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and stabilize the board with powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The Trinket Mage package provides additional versatility and utility to the deck, allowing it to adapt to different matchups and situations. Overall, this deck seeks to outlast the opponent and win through incremental advantage."
