It utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura to establish board presence and generate card advantage. The inclusion of Stoneforge Mystic allows for the tutor and play of powerful equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine, providing additional utility and threat. The mana base is optimized for consistency and the deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a dominant position and win through incremental advantage."

The deck also includes cards like Lightning Bolt for control and removal, creating a strong control presence while slowly building up to a game-winning Valakut combo. The key to success lies in efficiently managing resources and maximizing landfall triggers to overwhelm the opponent with damage."
