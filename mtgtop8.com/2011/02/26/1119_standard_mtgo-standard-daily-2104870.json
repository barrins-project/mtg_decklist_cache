            "notes": "This deck focuses on using control elements to dominate the opponent's board while utilizing powerful creatures like Squadron Hawk and Stoneforge Mystic to maintain board presence and pressure. Cards like Day of Judgment and Gideon Jura help control the battlefield, while Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and disruption. The deck also includes counterspells like Mana Leak and Spell Pierce to counter key spells, ensuring the opponent can't easily advance their game plan. The inclusion of Sword of Feast and Famine and Sylvok Lifestaff provide additional utility and threats to close out the game."
