By utilizing cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Inquisition of Kozilek, you can control the board and protect yourself while setting up for powerful finishers like Grave Titan and Sword of Feast and Famine. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents through card advantage and efficient removal, ultimately overwhelming them with threats they can't keep up with."
