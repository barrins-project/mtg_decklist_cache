The inclusion of Ezuri allows for a strong finish with his ability to pump up the entire team, while Eldrazi Monument provides protection and evasion.

The goal is to aggressively attack and quickly build a board presence that can deal large amounts of damage in a short amount of time. The inclusion of cards such as Steel Overseer and Tempered Steel further enhance the strength of the creatures on the battlefield, making it difficult for opponents to keep up and defend against the onslaught."
