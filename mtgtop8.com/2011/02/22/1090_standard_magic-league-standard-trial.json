By using Stoneforge Mystic to tutor for powerful equipment, the deck can establish a strong board presence and protect against threats. Sun Titan can also provide additional value by recurring key cards from the graveyard. With a focus on efficient removal and card advantage, the deck aims to outlast opponents and eventually overwhelm them with powerful threats."
