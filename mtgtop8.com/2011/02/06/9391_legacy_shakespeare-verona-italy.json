By consistently recurring key lands like Maze of Ith and Rishadan Port with Life from the Loam, the deck aims to stall the opponent's progress while setting up its own win conditions. With cards like Intuition and Exploration to accelerate land drops, the deck can quickly establish dominance on the battlefield. Engineered Explosives and Oblivion Stone provide board wipe options, while Mindslaver offers a unique win condition by taking control of the opponent's turns."

It also includes control elements like Force of Will and Brainstorm to protect the combo.
