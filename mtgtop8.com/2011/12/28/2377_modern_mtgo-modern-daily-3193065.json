            "notes": "The key strategy of this deck is to quickly generate mana through rituals and cantrips like Manamorphose and Desperate Ritual, while setting up Pyromancer Ascension to copy spells. This allows the player to build up storm count and cast a high-powered Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens for a lethal finish. Past in Flames provides recursion for spells already cast, making it easier to combo off and win the game in a single explosive turn. The deck focuses on efficiently chaining spells together to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of burn spells."
