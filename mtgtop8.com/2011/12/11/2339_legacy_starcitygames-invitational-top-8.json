The deck also includes cards like Flame-Kin Zealot and Firestorm to deal additional damage and finish off the opponent.

The combination of Veteran Explorer and Cabal Therapy allows the player to accelerate their mana while also disrupting the opponent's hand. Additionally, cards like Pernicious Deed and Maelstrom Pulse provide board sweepers to handle threats. The inclusion of Liliana of the Veil adds further disruption and card advantage."
