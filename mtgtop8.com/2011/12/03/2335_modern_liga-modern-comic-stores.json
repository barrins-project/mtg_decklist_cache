The deck also utilizes Past in Flames to recast previously used spells from the graveyard, enabling explosive turns and overwhelming the opponent with a storm of spells. Additionally, the deck includes card draw and deck manipulation to consistently find the pieces needed for the combo."

The deck aims to outlast its opponent by maintaining a high life total and overwhelming them with powerful creatures like Figure of Destiny. Emeria, the Sky Ruin provides late-game value by recurring key creatures from the graveyard."
