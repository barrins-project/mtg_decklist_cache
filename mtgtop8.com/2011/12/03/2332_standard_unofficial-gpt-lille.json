Card advantage is also key, with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Think Twice allowing the player to draw more cards and stay ahead of their opponent. Additionally, the deck includes win conditions like Consecrated Sphinx and White Sun's Zenith to close out the game once control has been established."

Cards like Snapcaster Mage and Phantasmal Image provide flexibility and card advantage, while cards like Vapor Snag and Gut Shot help to control the board. The inclusion of Delver of Secrets and Geist of Saint Traft provide additional threats for the opponent to deal with. The mana base is designed to make sure the deck can consistently cast its spells on curve."
