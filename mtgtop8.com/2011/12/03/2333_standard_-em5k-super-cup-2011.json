The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with cheap and evasive creatures while disrupting their game plan with counterspells and removal spells. The Illusion creatures become stronger and harder to deal with when Lord of the Unreal is on the battlefield, making it difficult for the opponent to effectively block or remove them."
