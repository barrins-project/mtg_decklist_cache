By utilizing a combination of direct damage spells like Incinerate, Lava Spike, and Lightning Bolt, along with creatures like Goblin Guide and Hellspark Elemental, this deck aims to pressure the opponent's life total early in the game. With a quick and consistent mana base of Teetering Peaks, Scalding Tarn, Arid Mesa, and Mountain, this aggro Red Deck Wins archetype seeks to overwhelm and defeat the opponent before they can stabilize."
