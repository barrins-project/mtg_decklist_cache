By using cards like Heritage Druid, Priest of Titania, and Glimpse of Nature, the deck can generate an overwhelming advantage in resources, leading to a win condition such as casting Emrakul, the Aeons Torn. Key to this strategy is managing resources efficiently and timing the combo pieces correctly to overwhelm the opponent."
