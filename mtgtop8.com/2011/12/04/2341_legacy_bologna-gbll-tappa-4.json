With a mix of counterspells, removal, and powerful finishers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Batterskull, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and win the game through incremental advantage and efficient creature beats. The mana base includes fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistent mana production and access to all necessary colors."
