Once Hive Mind is active, the deck aims to cast spells that force both players to copy them, often resulting in the opponent being unable to pay the Pact costs, leading to a victory. The deck also includes powerful backup options like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Force of Will to protect the combo and disrupt opponent's strategies. Overall, the deck revolves around setting up and executing a game-winning combo as efficiently as possible."
