The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy, utilizing cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to generate additional mana and resources. The inclusion of versatile cards like Shrapnel Blast also provides the deck with additional reach and removal options, making it a potent threat in Modern 1 vs 1 matchups."
