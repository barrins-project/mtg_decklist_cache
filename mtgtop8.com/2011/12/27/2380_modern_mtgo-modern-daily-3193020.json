By casting Hive Mind and following it up with Pact spells, you force your opponent to either lose the game or try to find a way to pay for the spells you've cast. By using cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Seething Song for fast mana, along with cards like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand for card selection, the deck aims to quickly set up its combo and win the game."
