The deck aims to maintain card advantage and board control throughout the game using powerful removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile, while also gaining additional card draw through Phyrexian Arena. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistent access to all three colors (red, white, and black) for casting spells of varying requirements."
