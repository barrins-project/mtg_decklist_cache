The key strategy is to quickly ramp up damage using infect creatures like Phyrexian Crusader and Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon, while protecting them with Spellskite. Removal spells like Doom Blade and Victim of Night help clear the way for your infect creatures to attack. Lashwrithe provides a boost to your creatures' power, while cards like Virulent Wound and Trigon of Rage help push through damage. Liliana of the Veil can disrupt the opponent's hand while Nihil Spellbomb helps deal with graveyard strategies."
