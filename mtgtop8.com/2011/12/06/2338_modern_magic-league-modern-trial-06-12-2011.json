Eternal Witness allows for recursion of key cards, while Tarmogoyf and Kitchen Finks provide early pressure and resilience. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent through efficient removal, graveyard synergies, and recursive threats, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with a combination of aggression and control."
