The inclusion of utility lands like Karakas and Maze of Ith adds versatility and protection. Removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Punishing Fire help control the opponent's board while equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Sword of Feast and Famine provide additional threats and advantages in combat. Overall, the deck aims to pressure the opponent aggressively while maintaining board control."

The deck also includes powerful card draw and counter spells to protect its combo pieces and disrupt opponents. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with massive threats early in the game, bypassing traditional mana costs and strategies to secure a quick victory."
