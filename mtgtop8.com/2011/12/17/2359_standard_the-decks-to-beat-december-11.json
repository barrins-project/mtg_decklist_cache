By utilizing cards like Delver of Secrets and Chandra's Phoenix to deal damage early on, and using cards like Mana Leak and Psychic Barrier to control the opponent's spells, the deck aims to maintain pressure and finish off the opponent with burn spells like Brimstone Volley and Incinerate. The deck also includes card draw and filtering spells like Ponder and Desperate Ravings to ensure consistency in drawing threats and answers."
