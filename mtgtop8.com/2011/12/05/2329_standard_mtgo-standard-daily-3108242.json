It also includes control elements with counterspells like Mana Leak and removal cards like Oblivion Ring. The strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of small creatures while maintaining control of the battlefield. The deck aims to win by dealing damage quickly and efficiently, utilizing the synergy between the aggressive weenie creatures and support spells."
