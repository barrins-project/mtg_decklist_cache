It also includes control elements such as Acidic Slime and Thrun, the Last Troll to deal with opposing threats. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its large creatures while also having the flexibility to search for specific creatures with Green Sun's Zenith. Additionally, cards like Garruk, Primal Hunter and Sword of Feast and Famine provide card advantage and additional utility."
