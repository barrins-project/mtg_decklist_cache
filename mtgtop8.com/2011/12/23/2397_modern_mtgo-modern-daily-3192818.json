The land base includes utility lands like Tectonic Edge and Celestial Colonnade for additional control options. The key strategy is to disrupt your opponent's game plan with removal and counterspells, while building card advantage and eventually winning the game with efficient threats. This deck aims to outvalue and outplay the opponent through careful resource management and timely decision-making."
