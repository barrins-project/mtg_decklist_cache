The goal is to put pressure on the opponent with efficient creatures like Blade Splicer and Geist of Saint Traft, while also having big threats like Consecrated Sphinx and Sun Titan. Batterskull and Swords provide additional damage and protection. The deck aims to have a strong early game with aggressive plays and then transition into a mid to late game control strategy to close out the game."
