The deck also includes disruptive elements like Oblivion Ring and Wrath of God to control the board. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Elspeth, Knight-Errant and Gideon Jura adds additional threats and versatility. The mana base allows for consistent color fixing and enables the deck to curve out smoothly. Overall, the deck aims to outpace and overwhelm the opponent with a fast, aggressive game plan."
