By utilizing cards like Noble Hierarch, Knight of the Reliquary, and Stoneforge Mystic, the deck aims to put early pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan with cards like Gaddock Teeg and Thrun, the Last Troll. The inclusion of powerful equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice and Batterskull further enhances the deck's aggressive strategy by giving its creatures additional abilities and making them harder to deal with."
