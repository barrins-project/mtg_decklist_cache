The synergy between Grand Architect and cards like Myr Battlesphere and Wurmcoil Engine allows for powerful board presence and combo potential. Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas provides card advantage and synergy with artifacts, while Contagion Clasp and Contagion Engine help to control the opponent's board state. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent through incremental advantages and efficient threat management."
