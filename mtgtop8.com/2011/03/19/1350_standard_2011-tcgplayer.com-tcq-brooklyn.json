The key strategy is to control the board by using cards like Day of Judgment and Gideon Jura to clear threats, while also using counterspells like Spell Pierce to stop opponent's plays. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor to provide card advantage and disruption. By controlling the game, the deck aims to eventually close out the game with powerful finishers like Baneslayer Angel and Sword of Feast and Famine."
