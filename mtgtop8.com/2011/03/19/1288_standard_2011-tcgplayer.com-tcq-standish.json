The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining card advantage through card draw and manipulation. Wall of Omens provides early defense and card draw, while Sun Titan allows for recursion of key permanents. Spreading Seas helps to fix mana and disrupt opponent's lands. Overall, the deck is designed to outlast the opponent and win through incremental advantage and powerful threats."
