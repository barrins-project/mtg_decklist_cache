The key concept is to control the board with removal spells like Pyroclasm and Slagstorm while setting up the combo with Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and lands like Raging Ravine. By efficiently ramping up mana and controlling the board, the player aims to deal huge amounts of damage with Valakut triggered by the Titans and other creatures entering the battlefield."
