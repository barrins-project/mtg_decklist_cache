            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game through the use of Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle triggers. By ramping up mana with cards like Cultivate and Primeval Titan, the deck aims to quickly reach the threshold of 5 Mountains to deal damage to opponents' creatures or directly to their face. Cards like Lightning Bolt and Slagstorm provide additional removal options, while Green Sun's Zenith helps search for key creatures like Primeval Titan. Overall, the deck focuses on efficient mana ramping and controlling the board until it can close out the game with Valakut triggers."
