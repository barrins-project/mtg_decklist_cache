It utilizes Squadron Hawk and Stoneforge Mystic to search for equipment like Sword of Body and Mind and Sword of Feast and Famine which help control the game even further. Day of Judgment serves as a board wipe to clear the opponent's creatures, while Gideon Jura and Jace, the Mind Sculptor provide additional control and card advantage. The deck aims to outlast the opponent and eventually overwhelm them with powerful threats and control elements."
