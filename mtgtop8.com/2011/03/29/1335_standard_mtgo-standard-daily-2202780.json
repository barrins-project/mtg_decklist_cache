By consistently playing lands and triggering abilities that benefit from them, such as Steppe Lynx and Plated Geopede, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and maintain a strong board presence throughout the game. Supporting cards like Stoneforge Mystic and Sword of Body and Mind provide additional utility and versatility, while removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Journey to Nowhere help control the board and pave the way for victory."
