By using cards like Goblin Lackey and Aether Vial to put creatures into play for free or at instant speed, the deck can establish a strong board presence early on. Cards like Goblin Warchief and Goblin Chieftain help to boost the power and speed of the Goblins, while Gempalm Incinerator provides removal options. The combination of speed, power, and synergy within the Goblin tribe makes this deck a formidable force in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."

            "notes": "This deck aims to control the game by efficiently removing threats and disrupting opponents' game plans with discard spells. It relies on powerful creatures like Knight of the Reliquary and Tarmogoyf to apply pressure while using card advantage engines like Dark Confidant and Sylvan Library to stay ahead. The deck also utilizes versatile removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Vindicate, combined with land disruption from cards like Wasteland and Knight of the Reliquary, to keep opponents in check. The combination of disruption, card advantage, and efficient threats makes this deck a formidable control strategy in Legacy 1 vs 1."
