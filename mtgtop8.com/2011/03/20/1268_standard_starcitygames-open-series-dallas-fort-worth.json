            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of aggressive Goblin creatures, buffed by Goblin Chieftain and Goblin Wardriver, while dealing direct damage with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Burst Lightning. The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Searing Blaze and finish off the opponent with direct damage or combat damage from the Goblins. Koth of the Hammer provides additional mana acceleration and can help close out games with its ultimate ability."
