By deploying powerful lords like Lord of Atlantis and Silvergill Adept, while disrupting the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze, the deck aims to control the tempo of the game. Utilizing card draw engines like Standstill and Aether Vial, the deck can maintain pressure and maintain board presence. With a mix of disruption and aggression, this deck is designed to quickly close out games in the Legacy format."

By utilizing cards like Goblin Lackey and Aether Vial, the deck can cheat out creatures and overwhelm opponents with a fast and powerful board presence. The deck also includes removal spells like Snuff Out to deal with opposing threats, while also utilizing land disruption with cards like Rishadan Port and Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
