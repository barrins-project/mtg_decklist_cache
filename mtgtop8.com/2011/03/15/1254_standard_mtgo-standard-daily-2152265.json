This deck focuses on dealing damage efficiently and controlling the board with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Go for the Throat. Dark Tutelage provides card draw to keep the pressure on the opponent, while Viscera Seer helps with sacrificing creatures for value. The key strategy is to maintain a strong board presence and apply constant pressure to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
