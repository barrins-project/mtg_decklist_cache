Primeval Titan and Khalni Heart Expedition provide additional opportunities for mana acceleration. The addition of Koth of the Hammer further enhances mana generation. Ultimately, the goal is to have Valakut in play with enough Mountains to deal significant damage to the opponent."

The deck includes efficient creatures like Goblin Guide and Kargan Dragonlord along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Searing Blaze to clear blockers and finish off the opponent. The goal is to consistently apply pressure and close out the game as quickly as possible by combining creature damage with direct damage spells."
