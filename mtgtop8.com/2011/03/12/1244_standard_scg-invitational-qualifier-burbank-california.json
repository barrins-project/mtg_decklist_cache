Thrummingbird and Contagion Engine provide incremental value over time. The deck also includes control elements like Stoic Rebuttal and Mindslaver to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Efficient card draw and mana ramp with cards like Preordain and Everflowing Chalice help the player maintain control of the game. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional card advantage and utility. Overall, the deck aims to control the game through powerful artifacts and card advantage."
