The inclusion of Squadron Hawk and Stoneforge Mystic allows for card advantage and tutoring key pieces of equipment, while cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura provide additional value and control options. By carefully managing resources and picking the right moments to strike, this deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a tactical and strategic manner."
