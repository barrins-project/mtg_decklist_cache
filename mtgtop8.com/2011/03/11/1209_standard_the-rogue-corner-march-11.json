It also includes control elements like Mana Leak and Doom Blade to protect the infect creatures and remove threats. Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas can help with card advantage and buffing artifacts like Sword of Body and Mind. The deck also includes a mill strategy with Jace Beleren and Sphere of the Suns to control the opponent's resources. Overall, the deck focuses on a fast and aggressive playstyle with infect as the main win condition."
