            "notes": "The key strategy of this deck is to quickly play creatures that benefit from landfall triggers, such as Steppe Lynx and Plated Geopede, while also using powerful aggro cards like Goblin Guide and Lightning Bolt to apply pressure on the opponent. The deck utilizes equipment like Sword of Body and Mind and Bonehoard to boost the power of its creatures, while also including removal spells like Journey to Nowhere to control the board. The inclusion of Stoneforge Mystic and Squadron Hawk helps to consistently find and play key equipment cards to further enhance the aggro strategy."
