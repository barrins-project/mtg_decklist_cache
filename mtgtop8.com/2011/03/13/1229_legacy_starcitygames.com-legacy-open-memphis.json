The inclusion of disruptive spells like Daze, Force of Will, and Spell Pierce helps to protect the Merfolk creatures and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also benefits from the mana acceleration provided by Aether Vial and includes utility lands like Mutavault and Wasteland to further enhance its aggressive strategy."
