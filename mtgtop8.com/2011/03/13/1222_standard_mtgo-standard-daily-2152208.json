It utilizes planeswalkers like Gideon Jura and Venser, the Sojourner to maintain board control and protect key threats like Celestial Colonnade and Wurmcoil Engine. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating incremental advantage through card draw and powerful spells. Mana denial with cards like Tectonic Edge and Contagion Clasp helps maintain control of the board, while cards like Day of Judgment provide a reset button when needed."
