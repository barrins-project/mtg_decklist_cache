Utilizing powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura, you can dictate the tempo of the match and protect your threats with counterspells like Mana Leak and Spell Pierce. The deck also includes Squadron Hawk for card advantage and Sword of Body and Mind and Sword of Feast and Famine to close out the game with powerful equipment."
