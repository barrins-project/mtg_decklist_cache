With this mana advantage, the deck aims to play a big spell like Blue Sun's Zenith to draw a large number of cards or even deck the opponent. Cunning Wish is there to search for answers or additional combo pieces, making this deck a powerful combo-based strategy in Legacy 1 vs 1 format."

By playing low-cost, high-power creatures like Steppe Lynx, Tarmogoyf, and Wild Nacatl, combined with powerful removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Knight of the Reliquary and Grim Lavamancer provide additional utility and flexibility. The deck's mana base is also carefully constructed to ensure consistent access to the necessary colors of mana for casting spells."

It aims to control the game through efficient removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Vindicate, while also maintaining card advantage with Dark Confidant and Stoneforge Mystic. The deck also utilizes powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf and Knight of the Reliquary to pressure the opponent. By utilizing a resource denial strategy with Wasteland and land destruction spells, the deck aims to slow down the opponent and eventually overwhelm them with its threats."
