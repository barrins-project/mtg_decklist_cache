By denying opponents resources with Leonin Arbiter and Spreading Seas, and by efficiently answering threats with cards like Mana Leak and Day of Judgment, the deck aims to reach the late game where it can dominate with powerful threats like Baneslayer Angel and Wurmcoil Engine. The inclusion of cards like Luminarch Ascension and Celestial Colonnade also provide alternative win conditions for the deck."
