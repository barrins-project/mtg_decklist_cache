The mana acceleration provided by Lotus Cobra and Explore help to ramp into these threats quickly, while Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Garruk Wildspeaker provide card advantage and additional utility. The deck aims to stall the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Mana Leak and removal like Lightning Bolt, while building up a board presence to close out the game."
