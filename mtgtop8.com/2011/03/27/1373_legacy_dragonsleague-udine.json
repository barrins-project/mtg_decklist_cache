By using cards like Force of Will, Counterspell, and Spell Pierce, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's plans and protect its own key cards. Pernicious Deed and Innocent Blood provide removal options for creatures on the board, while Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Sensei's Divining Top help generate card advantage. Standstill is used to slow down the game and potentially draw extra cards. The deck also includes a mix of land destruction and creature beatdown with Mishra's Factory and Wasteland."
