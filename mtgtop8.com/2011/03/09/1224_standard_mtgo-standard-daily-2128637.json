            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game through efficient removal, counterspells, and powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura. By utilizing cards like Squadron Hawk and Stoneforge Mystic to search for key equipment like Sword of Body and Mind and Sword of Feast and Famine, the deck can establish a strong board presence and outvalue the opponent. Sun Titan provides late-game value by recurring important threats from the graveyard. Overall, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while presenting threats of its own to secure victory."
