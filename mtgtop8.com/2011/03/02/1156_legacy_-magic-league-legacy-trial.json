Cunning Wish provides additional versatility by allowing access to sideboard cards, while Blue Sun's Zenith serves as a win condition by decking the opponent through drawing cards."

Additionally, the deck can generate card advantage through Glimpse of Nature and Thoughtcast, while also having the potential to create an infinite combo with Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek. Overall, the deck prioritizes speed and efficiency in order to outpace and outvalue the opponent."

The deck aims to assemble and cast a lethal Tendrils of Agony or Ill-Gotten Gains, taking advantage of cards like Infernal Tutor and Ad Nauseam to close out the game in one explosive turn. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Duress and Orim's Chant to protect its combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan."

Pithing Needle and Relic of Progenitus disrupt the opponent's strategy, while Mox Opal accelerates mana production. Engineered Explosives and Basilisk Collar offer additional control options. The deck capitalizes on synergy between artifacts and creature buffs to overwhelm opponents in fast-paced matches."
