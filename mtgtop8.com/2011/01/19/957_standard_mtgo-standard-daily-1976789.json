By ramping up mana with cards like Arbor Elf and Llanowar Elves, and boosting the power of Elves with cards like Elvish Archdruid and Joraga Warcaller, the deck aims to quickly build a formidable board presence. Cards like Genesis Wave and Eldrazi Monument provide additional power and resilience to ensure victory. With a strong emphasis on quick, aggressive plays, this deck looks to outpace and overpower the opponent before they can mount a defense."
