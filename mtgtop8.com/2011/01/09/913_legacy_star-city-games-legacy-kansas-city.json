By sacrificing creatures like Golgari Grave-Troll and Golgari Thug and utilizing cards such as Bridge from Below and Dread Return, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a powerful army of creatures. The inclusion of cards like Cabal Therapy and Careful Study further helps in filling the graveyard efficiently. Overall, the deck aims to create a high-powered board state and disrupt the opponent's game plan through its unique combo strategy."
