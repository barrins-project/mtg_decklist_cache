The deck also includes card advantage engines like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Garruk Wildspeaker to outvalue the opponent. Overall, the deck seeks to outlast the opponent and take over the game with its powerful threats and control elements."

The deck aims to play a defensive game until it can assemble its combo pieces and win the game in one explosive turn. By efficiently ramping up mana and managing resources, the deck can overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of powerful spells and abilities."
