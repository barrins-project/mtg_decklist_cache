The deck focuses on using cards like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to counter spells, Standstill to draw cards and slow down the opponent, and Stoneforge Mystic to search for equipment cards like Swords and Jitte. By combining disruption with a quick clock, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents and secure victory through efficient use of resources."

Dark Confidant provides card advantage, while Life from the Loam allows for recurring land destruction. The deck also has some versatility with Elspeth, Knight-Errant for additional threats or Pernicious Deed for mass removal. Overall, the key concept is to maintain control through resource denial and disruption."
