The deck also utilizes disruptive elements like Spell Pierce, Force of Will, and Daze to control the opponent's spells. Aether Vial helps cheat creatures into play while maintaining tempo. The mana base includes Wasteland and fetch lands to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Standstill can provide card advantage while also slowing down the opponent's game plan."
