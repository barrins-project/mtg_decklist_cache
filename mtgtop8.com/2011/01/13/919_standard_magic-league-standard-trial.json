The goal is to eventually cast Genesis Wave to put several powerful creatures and permanents onto the battlefield at once, overwhelming the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Frost Titan and Primeval Titan for additional threats and value. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and control to help ensure the combo goes off smoothly."
