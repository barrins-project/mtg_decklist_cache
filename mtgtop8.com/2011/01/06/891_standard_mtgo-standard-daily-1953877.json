Stoneforge Mystic helps to search for equipment cards while Memnite and Ornithopter provide additional early game pressure.

Utilize mana efficient counterspells and removal spells to deal with threats, while ramping up with cards like Lotus Cobra and Oracle of Mul Daya. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and control, while mana denial with cards like Spreading Seas and Tectonic Edge can help slow down your opponent. Finish the game with powerful threats like Grave Titan and Frost Titan. Balancing card advantage, disruption, and threats is key to piloting this deck effectively."
