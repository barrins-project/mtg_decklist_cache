By utilizing counterspells, hand disruption, and targeted removal spells, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's game plan and take over the game with its own powerful creatures and planeswalkers. The mana base supports the control elements of the deck, allowing for consistency in casting spells and activating creature lands for additional threats."

This allows the player to slow down the opponent's game plan while setting up their win condition with powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The inclusion of cards like Grave Titan provides a strong late-game threat to finish off the opponent. This deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind them out in a long game, ultimately coming out on top through careful control and manipulation of the game."
