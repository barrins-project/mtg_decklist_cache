The deck focuses on maintaining a defensive position with cards like Standstill, while using powerful planeswalkers like Elspeth, Knight-Errant and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to gain incremental advantage. The inclusion of cards like Engineered Explosives and Crucible of Worlds allows for versatile answers to different threats. Additionally, the deck has a strong mana base with a mix of dual lands and fetch lands to ensure consistent access to all colors of mana."
