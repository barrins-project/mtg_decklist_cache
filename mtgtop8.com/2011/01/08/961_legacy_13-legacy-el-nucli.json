This allows the player to utilize cards like Seismic Assault to deal direct damage to the opponent. Additionally, the deck utilizes Countryside Crusher to continuously grow in power and Tarmogoyf as a powerful threat. Burning Wish adds versatility by allowing the player to access a sideboard card when needed."
