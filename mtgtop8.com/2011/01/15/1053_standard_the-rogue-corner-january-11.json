The deck also focuses on generating mana and providing utility with cards like Aether Adept and Grand Architect. Additionally, it aims to create a strong board presence with creatures like Wurmcoil Engine and Molten-Tail Masticore while also benefiting from cards like Lighthouse Chronologist and Coralhelm Commander. Overall, the deck seeks to assert control and outmaneuver opponents with its various strategies and powerful creatures."
