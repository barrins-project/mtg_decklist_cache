Additionally, the deck can use Tarnished Citadel, Cephalid Coliseum, and City of Brass to fix mana and help the combo come together."

The deck also includes disruptive elements like Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base includes lands like Cephalid Coliseum and Gemstone Mine to ensure the deck can operate smoothly."
