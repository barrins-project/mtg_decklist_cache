By using cards like Swords to Plowshares, Hymn to Tourach, and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's strategy, while deploying threats like Dark Confidant, Tarmogoyf, and Knight of the Reliquary. Additionally, the deck includes powerful equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice and Umezawa's Jitte to further enhance the effectiveness of its creatures. The mana base is optimized for consistency and resource denial with cards like Wasteland."
