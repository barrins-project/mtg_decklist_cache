            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to quickly and efficiently set up a board presence with low-cost creatures like Ornithopter, Glint Hawk, and Kor Outfitter. The deck also aims to control the opponent's threats with cards like Swords to Plowshares and Soltari Priest. The main win condition is to activate Quest for the Holy Relic, which allows you to search for powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and the Swords. Once equipped, these weapons enhance your creatures and provide additional removal or card advantage. Argentum Armor serves as a powerful late-game threat and can quickly close out the game."
