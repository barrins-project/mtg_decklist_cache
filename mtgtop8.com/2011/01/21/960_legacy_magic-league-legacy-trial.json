By utilizing cards like Aether Vial and Mother of Runes, the deck aims to control the game and protect its key creatures while chipping away at the opponent's life total. The deck also includes powerful equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice and Umezawa's Jitte to provide additional advantages in combat. With disruptive elements like Gaddock Teeg and Mangara of Corondor, this deck seeks to outmaneuver and overwhelm opponents in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
