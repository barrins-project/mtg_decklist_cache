The deck also includes cards like Contagion Clasp and Tumble Magnet to help proliferate poison counters and control the opponent's board. In addition, there are control elements like Mana Leak and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The land base includes Inkmoth Nexus for additional infect threats. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, aggressive infect creatures while controlling the game with disruption and removal spells."
