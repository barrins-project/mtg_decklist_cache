By flooding the board with cheap creatures like Goblin Guide and Memnite, and then buffing them with cards like Goblin Bushwhacker and Signal Pest, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Kuldotha Rebirth and Devastating Summons allows for explosive plays, while Mox Opal helps ramp up mana production. The deck is designed to finish off opponents before they have a chance to stabilize."
