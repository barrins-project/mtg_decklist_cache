Elspeth, Knight-Errant and Jace, the Mind Sculptor provide additional threat and card advantage. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by controlling the board and limiting their options."

The deck aims to generate a large storm count, making Tendrils of Agony a lethal finisher. Additionally, disruption spells like Duress and Thoughtseize help protect the combo and dismantle the opponent's strategies. The deck focuses on speed and efficiency to overwhelm the opponent before they can respond."

The use of cards like Brainstorm, Force of Will, and Vendilion Clique allows for card advantage and disruption against the opponent's game plan. The deck also utilizes the synergy between lands and creatures with cards like Wasteland and Loam to provide additional value. The inclusion of equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice and Umezawa's Jitte enhances the deck's ability to deal damage and control the board."
