This allows the player to overwhelm their opponent with big threats such as Emrakul, Progenitus, and Woodfall Primus. The deck also includes various cantrips and counterspells to help dig for combo pieces and protect the player's creatures. Overall, the goal is to establish a dominant board presence early in the game and close out the match before the opponent can respond effectively."
