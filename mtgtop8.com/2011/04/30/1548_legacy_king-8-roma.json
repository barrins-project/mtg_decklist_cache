It aims to finish the game as quickly as possible by utilizing efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, while also utilizing aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide and Mogg Fanatic. The mana base is streamlined to ensure consistency in playing its spells on curve. The deck prioritizes early aggression and maintaining pressure on the opponent to close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
