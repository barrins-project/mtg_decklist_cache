It also utilizes equipment like Sword of Body and Mind and Sword of Feast and Famine to provide additional damage and protection. The deck focuses on attacking early and often to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own strategy, while also using burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Staggershock for removal and reach."
