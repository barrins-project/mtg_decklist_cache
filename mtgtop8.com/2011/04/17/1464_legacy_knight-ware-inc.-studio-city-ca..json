The deck also includes cards like Duress and Orim's Chant to disrupt opponents' strategies and protect the combo. Additionally, the deck includes cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder to dig for key cards."

Aether Vial allows for fast creature deployment, while disruptive spells like Daze, Force of Will, and Spell Pierce help protect the board state. With a focus on tempo and aggressive creature-based gameplay, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently, utilizing key lands like Mutavault and Wasteland to maintain control of the battlefield."
