The deck focuses on quickly deploying low-cost artifacts to the battlefield and then using cards like Arcbound Ravager and Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas to buff them up and push for damage. The inclusion of Thopter Foundry provides additional value by generating flying tokens, and Mox Opal helps to ramp up mana production. Overall, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence and close out the game aggressively."

The deck also includes cards like Cunning Wish and Merchant Scroll to search for key pieces when needed. The goal is to combo off quickly and overwhelm the opponent with a massive amount of mana to win the game in a single turn."
