Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional card advantage and utility, while Sword of Feast and Famine offers a win condition. Tectonic Edge helps disrupt opponent's mana base, and Celestial Colonnade provides a powerful finisher. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents through careful resource management and strategic play."
