By efficiently managing resources and using cards like Lotus Cobra and Explore to ramp up mana, the deck aims to quickly establish board presence with large threats like Inferno Titan and Frost Titan. The inclusion of cards like Garruk Wildspeaker and Thrun, the Last Troll provide additional utility and resilience to the deck, allowing it to adapt to various situations and outmaneuver opponents."
