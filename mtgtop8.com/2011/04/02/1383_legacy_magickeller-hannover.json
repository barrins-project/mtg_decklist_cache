The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Elspeth, Knight-Errant and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to generate card advantage and threaten opponents. Additionally, the inclusion of Vedalken Shackles allows the deck to steal opponents' creatures. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the color requirements of the spells and provide flexibility in fetching necessary lands."
