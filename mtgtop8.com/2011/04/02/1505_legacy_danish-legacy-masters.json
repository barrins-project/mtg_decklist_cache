The deck aims to maintain control of the board with counterspells like Spell Snare and Daze, and card selection with Brainstorm and Ponder. The mana base is carefully constructed to cast all the spells in the deck efficiently, with a mix of dual lands and fetch lands to fix mana and enable graveyard interactions."
