The deck also includes counterspells and hand disruption cards to control the game and protect the infect creatures. The deck aims to win by dealing 10 poison counters to the opponent, rather than reducing their life total to zero. Additionally, the deck includes lands that can turn into creatures with infect to provide another win condition."
