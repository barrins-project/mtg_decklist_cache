The deck also focuses on card advantage and manipulation with cards like Brainstorm, Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and Sensei's Divining Top. The mana base is optimized for consistency and allows for the deck to be able to play a variety of spells effectively. The win condition is to ultimately outvalue the opponent and close out the game with Elspeth, Knight-Errant or Mishra's Factory."

The deck utilizes lands like Mutavault and Wasteland for resource denial, and Riptide Laboratory for creature protection. Ultimately, the strategy revolves around building a fast and resilient offense while controlling the opponent's actions."
