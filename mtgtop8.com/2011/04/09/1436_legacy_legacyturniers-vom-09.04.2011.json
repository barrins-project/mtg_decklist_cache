By combining efficient threats like Tarmogoyf and Knight of the Reliquary with disruptive counterspells like Daze and Force of Will, as well as removal like Swords to Plowshares, the deck aims to pressure the opponent while preventing them from establishing their own game plan. The inclusion of Stoneforge Mystic and potent equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice and Umezawa's Jitte give the deck additional ways to close out games quickly and efficiently."
