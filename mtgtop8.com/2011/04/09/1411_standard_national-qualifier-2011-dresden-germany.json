It also includes card advantage through Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana Vess. The win condition is through value creatures like Grave Titan and man lands like Creeping Tar Pit. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while gaining incremental advantage through card draw and efficient removal spells. The mana base is designed to support the control game plan with a mix of blue and black sources."
