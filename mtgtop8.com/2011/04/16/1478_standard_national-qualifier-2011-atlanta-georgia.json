            "notes": "This deck focuses on controlling the game through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and powerful planeswalkers. The main strategy is to establish board control with cards like Squadron Hawk and Stoneforge Mystic, while utilizing Sword of Feast and Famine to disrupt opponents' mana and untap lands. Gideon Jura and Jace, the Mind Sculptor provide additional control options, with Sun Titan offering recursion for key threats. The deck's mana base allows for consistent access to various colors and spells, ensuring that the player can effectively control the pace of the game."
