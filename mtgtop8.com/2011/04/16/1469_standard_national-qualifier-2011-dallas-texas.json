            "notes": "The main strategy of this deck is to control the game by using powerful creatures and spells to manipulate the board state and disrupt the opponent's actions. By establishing control early on with cards like Mana Leak and Lightning Bolt, the deck can then ramp up its mana production with Lotus Cobra and Explore to play strong threats like Inferno Titan and Avenger of Zendikar. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional control and card advantage, while Precursor Golem can generate powerful token armies. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful creatures."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly overwhelming opponents by playing multiple aggressive creatures with landfall abilities to maximize damage output. By playing a mix of low-cost creatures and burn spells, the deck aims to maintain board presence and deal damage efficiently. Additionally, the inclusion of equipment like Sword of Body and Mind and Bonehoard enhances the deck's aggro strategy by providing additional power and protection to its creatures. Koth of the Hammer serves as a powerful finisher, generating mana and allowing for explosive plays in the late game."
