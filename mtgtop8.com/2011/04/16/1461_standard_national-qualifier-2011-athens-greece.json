By limiting the opponent's resources and board presence, the deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a win condition with powerful creatures like Grave Titan and Wurmcoil Engine. The inclusion of land destruction cards like Tectonic Edge and Creeping Tar Pit adds an additional layer of control, while cards like Spreading Seas can disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the deck seeks to dominate the game through strategic control and powerful threats."
