The deck also aims to generate card advantage through Squadron Hawk and Preordain, and utilize equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine to push through damage. The deck's win condition is to either overwhelm the opponent with card advantage and powerful threats, or to chip away at their life total with evasive creatures like Inkmoth Nexus and Celestial Colonnade."
