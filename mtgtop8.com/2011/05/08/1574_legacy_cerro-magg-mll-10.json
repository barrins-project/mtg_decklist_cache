Standstill is included to slow down the opponent's card advantage, while Merfolk Sovereign can tap and untap creatures for added versatility. The deck's strategy revolves around tempo, disruption, and leveraging Merfolk tribal synergies for maximum efficiency."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with aggressive creatures like Wild Nacatl and Kavu Predator, while disrupting their game plan with cards like Gaddock Teeg and Qasali Pridemage. The deck also features removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Path to Exile to deal with any threats the opponent may have. The mana base is built around efficient dual lands like Taiga and Plateau to ensure the deck can consistently cast its spells. The strategy is to apply pressure early and maintain board control to secure victory."
