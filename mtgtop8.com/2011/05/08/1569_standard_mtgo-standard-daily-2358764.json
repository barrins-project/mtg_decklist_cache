The deck focuses on quickly bringing out big creatures like Primeval Titan and Inferno Titan, while also utilizing cards like Oracle of Mul Daya and Explore to help with card advantage and ramp. The deck includes cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Summoning Trap to search for specific creatures when needed. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures and burn spells."
