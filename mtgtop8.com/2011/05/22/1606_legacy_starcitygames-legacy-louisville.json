It also has removal spells like Vindicate to handle threats. Bitterblossom provides a steady stream of creatures, while the equipment cards (Batterskull, Sword of Fire and Ice, Umezawa's Jitte) enhance the deck's combat abilities. Sensei's Divining Top and Chrome Mox offer card selection and mana acceleration. The deck is built with a solid mana base, including lands that can disrupt the opponent's mana (Wasteland). The inclusion of Elspeth, Knight-Errant adds versatility and another win condition."
