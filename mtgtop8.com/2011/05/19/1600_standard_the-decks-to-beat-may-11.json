The inclusion of Inkmoth Nexus provides an alternate win condition by turning into a flying infect creature. Steel Overseer helps to further boost the artifact creatures each turn, while Phyrexian Revoker disrupts the opponent's plans. The deck aims to apply early pressure and finish the game before the opponent can stabilize."
