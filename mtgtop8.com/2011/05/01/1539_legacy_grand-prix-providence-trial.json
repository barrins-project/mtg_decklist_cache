The deck includes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Elspeth, Knight-Errant to provide additional card advantage and win conditions. It also features efficient creatures like Squadron Hawk and Stoneforge Mystic to apply pressure and search for key artifacts. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistency and resource denial with cards like Wasteland."

The key strategy is to chain together cheap creature spells to trigger powerful combo abilities, allowing for explosive turns that can overwhelm opponents. Vengevine serves as a powerful finisher, while Wirewood Symbiote and Heritage Druid provide crucial synergy and protection for the combo pieces. The deck aims to quickly assemble a lethal board presence and overrun the opponent before they can establish a defense."
