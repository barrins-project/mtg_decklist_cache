            "notes": "The main concept of this deck revolves around the combo of reanimation and discard. The deck aims to quickly fill the graveyard with powerful creatures using cards like Cabal Therapy, Careful Study, and Entomb. It then utilizes spells like Reanimate, Animate Dead, and Exhume to bring those creatures back onto the battlefield for a fraction of their mana cost. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Mental Misstep to protect its combo pieces. Overall, the key idea is to efficiently reanimate strong creatures while disrupting the opponent's gameplay."
