It also leverages the protection offered by cards like Spellskite to keep key creatures safe, while using efficient removal spells like Go for the Throat to handle threats. With a mix of hand disruption, countermagic, and powerful threats, this deck aims to control the game and dictate the pace of play until victory is achieved."
