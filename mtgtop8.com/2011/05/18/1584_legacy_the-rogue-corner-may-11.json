It also focuses on disrupting opponent's mana base with Magus of the Moon and Blood Moon. The deck is centered around casting enormous threats like Blightsteel Colossus, Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, and Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre as early as possible to overwhelm the opponent and win the game in a single turn. With aggressive mana acceleration, this deck aims to achieve its win condition in a quick and explosive manner."
