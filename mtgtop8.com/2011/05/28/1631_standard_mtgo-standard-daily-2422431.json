By utilizing cards like Arbor Elf, Copperhorn Scout, and Elvish Archdruid to generate mana and buff the team with Ezuri, Renegade Leader, the deck aims to set up explosive turns that can end the game in just a few swings. Adding in cards like Fauna Shaman and Green Sun's Zenith allows for consistent creature finding and Lead the Stampede can refill the hand with more Elves to keep up the pressure."
