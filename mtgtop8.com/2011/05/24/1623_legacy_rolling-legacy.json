Aether Vial helps to cheat out creatures quickly, while cards like Lord of Atlantis and Merrow Reejerey pump up the team. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Wasteland to deal with non-basic lands. The synergy between Merfolk creatures and support spells allows for a fast and aggressive gameplay style in Legacy 1 vs 1 format."
