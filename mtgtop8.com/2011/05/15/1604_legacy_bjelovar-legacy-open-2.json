Additionally, cards like Standstill and Jace, the Mind Sculptor provide card advantage and control options, while Engineered Explosives and Pernicious Deed help deal with threats on the board. The deck also includes land destruction elements with Wasteland and Mishra's Factory to further disrupt the opponent's game plan."
