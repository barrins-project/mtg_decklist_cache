By consistently tutoring for key creatures like Vengevine, Mirran Crusader, and Baneslayer Angel, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent and control the tempo of the game. The inclusion of powerful equipment like Sword of War and Peace and Batterskull further enhances the deck's aggro strategy, allowing for quick and efficient wins."
