This enables aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide, Plated Geopede, and Steppe Lynx to deal damage quickly. Stoneforge Mystic and Squadron Hawk provide additional threats and card advantage. The inclusion of equipment like Batterskull, Sword of Feast and Famine, and Sword of War and Peace enhances the power of these creatures. Lightning Bolt and Goblin Bushwhacker can also provide additional reach and damage to help secure victory."
