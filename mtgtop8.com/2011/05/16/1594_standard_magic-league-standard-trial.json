The main win condition revolves around equipping Sword of War and Peace or Sword of Feast and Famine onto creatures like Celestial Colonnade or Inkmoth Nexus to quickly finish off the opponent. The deck aims to control the board, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and eventually overwhelm them with powerful threats and efficient card draw."
