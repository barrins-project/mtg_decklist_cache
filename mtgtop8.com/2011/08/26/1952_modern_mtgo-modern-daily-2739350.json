The key goal is to ramp up mana with Nettle Sentinel and Heritage Druid, then use Green Sun's Zenith or Primal Command to tutor for key pieces of the combo. Emrakul, the Aeons Torn can be brought out for a game-ending swing. Summoner's Pact and Regal Force provide additional searching and card draw, while Viridian Shaman offers removal. The deck focuses on explosive plays and a strong synergy between its cards."
