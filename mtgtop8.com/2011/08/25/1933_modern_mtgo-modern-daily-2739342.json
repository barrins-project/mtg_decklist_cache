The deck includes cards for card draw and counterspells to protect the combo, as well as additional combo pieces like Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker. The mana base provides a mix of colors to support the combo pieces and includes lands that can provide extra mana acceleration. Overall, the key concept of the deck is to efficiently assemble and protect the combo to win the game quickly."
