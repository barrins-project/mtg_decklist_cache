Once Pyromancer Ascension is online, the deck can chain together cheap spells like Lightning Bolt and Gitaxian Probe to generate lethal storm count and win the game. Remand and Repeal provide disruption and protection for the combo, while Time Warp offers an additional win condition. The deck is designed to be fast, efficient, and able to win out of nowhere with a high storm count."
