            "notes": "The deck focuses on assembling the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Mine, Urza's Power Plant, Urza's Tower) to generate huge amounts of mana in order to cast powerful Eldrazi creatures like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre. The deck also includes control elements like Condescend, Remand, and Engineered Explosives to disrupt the opponent's game plan while ramping into its big threats. The goal is to control the game early on with counterspells and removal, then overwhelm the opponent with massive creatures in the late game."
