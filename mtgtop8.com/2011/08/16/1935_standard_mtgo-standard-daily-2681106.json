By using cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Jace Beleren to disrupt the opponent's hand and draw extra cards, along with removal spells like Doom Blade and Go for the Throat, the deck aims to control the board and prevent the opponent from developing their own game plan. The deck also includes finishers like Consecrated Sphinx and Grave Titan to close out the game once it has established control."
