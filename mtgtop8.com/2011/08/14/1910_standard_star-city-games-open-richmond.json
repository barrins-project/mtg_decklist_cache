By controlling the board with counterspells and disruptive spells, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures like Wurmcoil Engine and Lord of the Unreal. The deck also includes card draw and deck manipulation to ensure consistency in drawing key cards. Additionally, the inclusion of Spreading Seas and Tectonic Edge provides additional disruption to the opponent's mana base."
