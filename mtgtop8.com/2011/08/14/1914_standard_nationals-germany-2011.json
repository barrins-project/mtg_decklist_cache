The inclusion of cards like Shrine of Burning Rage and Sword of War and Peace help to close out games quickly and efficiently, while also providing additional threats for the opponent to deal with."

It also utilizes versatile removal spells like Doom Blade and Go for the Throat to deal with threats, while leveraging card advantage from Consecrated Sphinx and Jace Beleren. The deck seeks to stabilize the game by dropping powerful threats like Grave Titan and Karn Liberated in the late game to ultimately control the match and emerge victorious."
