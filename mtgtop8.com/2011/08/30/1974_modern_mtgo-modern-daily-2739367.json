Remand provides disruption while Muddle the Mixture can be used to find key combo pieces. The deck excels at creating explosive turns and overwhelming the opponent with a flurry of spells."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on assembling the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Mine, Urza's Power Plant, Urza's Tower) to generate a large amount of mana quickly. The key concept is to ramp up mana production through cards like Expedition Map and Glimmerpost to quickly cast high-cost threats like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Primeval Titan. It also features control elements such as Remand and All Is Dust to disrupt opponents' strategies and maintain board control. The deck's strategy revolves around overwhelming opponents with powerful creatures and controlling the game with counters and removal spells."
