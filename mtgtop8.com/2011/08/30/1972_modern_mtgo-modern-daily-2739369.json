It also uses cards like Smallpox and Cry of Contrition to disrupt the opponent's resources. The deck uses a mix of removal spells like Slaughter Pact and Doom Blade to control the board. The mana base is designed to support the deck's two-color requirements, with cards like Verdant Catacombs and Overgrown Tomb providing the necessary black and green mana."
