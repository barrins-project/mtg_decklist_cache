The deck aims to control the board with cards such as Beast Within and Terastodon, and eventually overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre. The combination of ramp, control, and big threats makes this deck a formidable opponent in Modern 1 vs 1 matches."
