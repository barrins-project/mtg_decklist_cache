The key strategy is to assemble the UrzaTron lands (Cloudpost, Glimmerpost, and Vesuva) to generate a large amount of mana, allowing you to play your powerful creatures ahead of schedule. The deck also includes removal spells like Beast Within and Oblivion Stone to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the main concept of this deck is to overwhelm your opponent with massive creatures and control the game with powerful spells."
