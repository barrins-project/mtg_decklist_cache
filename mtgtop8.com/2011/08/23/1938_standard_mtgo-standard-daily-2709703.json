With cards like Goblin Grenade and Lightning Bolt for direct damage, along with Teetering Peaks for extra damage output, the goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. Devastating Summons can be used as a finisher, while Spikeshot Elder and Searing Blaze provide additional removal options to control the board and press the advantage."
