It uses cards like Pact of the Titan and Intervention Pact to force the opponent into making unfavorable choices. The deck also includes cantrips like Ponder and Preordain for consistency and disruption with Remand. The mana base includes a mix of Islands, Mountains, and lands that can search for specific cards, like Tolaria West."
