The goal is to fill the opponent's graveyard as fast as possible to make cards like Hedron Crab and Jace, Memory Adept more effective. Surgical Extraction can be used to remove key cards from the opponent's deck, further hindering their strategy. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with mill and card advantage to secure victory."
