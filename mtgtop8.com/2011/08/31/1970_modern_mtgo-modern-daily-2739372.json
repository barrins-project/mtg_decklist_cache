By combining low-cost creatures like Kird Ape, Wild Nacatl, and Loam Lion with powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Knight of the Reliquary, the deck can put pressure on the opponent early in the game. The deck also includes versatile removal spells like Lightning Bolt, Lightning Helix, and Path to Exile to deal with opposing threats and clear the way for your creatures to attack."
