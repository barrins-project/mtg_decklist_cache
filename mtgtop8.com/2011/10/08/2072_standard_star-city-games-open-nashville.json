The deck also includes cards like Shrine of Burning Rage to ramp up damage over time and finish off opponents. The inclusion of Chandra's Phoenix and Grim Lavamancer provides additional resilience and reach.

            "notes": "The main focus of this UW Control deck is to control the game by countering opponent's spells, removing threats, and drawing cards to outvalue the opponent. With a mix of counterspells, removal, and card draw, it aims to stabilize the board and win by playing powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Consecrated Sphinx. The deck also has a good mix of creatures, planeswalkers, and noncreature spells to deal with a variety of threats, making it versatile and adaptable in different matchups."
