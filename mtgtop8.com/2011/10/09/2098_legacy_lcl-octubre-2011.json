By combining early aggression with countermagic and disruption, the deck aims to maintain tempo and control over the game, ultimately overwhelming the opponent before they can stabilize. This strategy of aggressive disruption is the core concept of this Canadian Threshold deck in the Legacy format."

The deck is built around the synergy between Green Sun's Zenith and Natural Order to tutor for powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Progenitus. The inclusion of disruptive creatures like Vendilion Clique and Knight of the Reliquary adds versatility to the deck's game plan. Overall, the deck looks to establish an early advantage and maintain pressure throughout the game to secure a quick victory."
