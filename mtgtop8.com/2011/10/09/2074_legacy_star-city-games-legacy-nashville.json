The Faeries provide a steady stream of flying threats while also disrupting the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent with card advantage from cards like Dark Confidant and Snapcaster Mage while also utilizing efficient removal spells like Dismember and Diabolic Edict. The manabase is focused on maximizing the efficiency of the spells while also providing utility with lands like Mutavault and Wasteland."
