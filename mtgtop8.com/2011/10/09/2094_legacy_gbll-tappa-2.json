With a mix of efficient creatures like Tarmogoyf and disruptive spells like Force of Will, the deck aims to control the game's tempo and out-value the opponent. The inclusion of Bloodbraid Elf and Punishing Fire adds versatility and resilience to the deck, allowing for multiple lines of play. The deck's mana base is carefully crafted to provide consistent access to all colors needed for its spells and creatures."
