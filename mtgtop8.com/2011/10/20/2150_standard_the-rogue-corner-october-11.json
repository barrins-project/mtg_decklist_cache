By casting powerful Illusion creatures like Lord of the Unreal and leveraging cards like Phantasmal Image and Phantasmal Dragon, the deck aims to quickly establish board presence and apply pressure to opponents. Additionally, the inclusion of counter spells like Mana Leak and disruption spells like Dismember help to protect and support the Illusion creatures in order to maintain dominance in the game."
