The deck focuses on dealing quick damage to the opponent, utilizing creatures like Stromkirk Noble and Hero of Oxid Ridge, as well as burn spells like Incinerate and Brimstone Volley. Combat tricks like Arc Trail and Koth of the Hammer can also be used to optimize damage output. The key strategy is to establish early board presence and quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can mount a defense."

Elspeth Tirel serves as a finisher by creating even more tokens or wiping the opponent's board. Beast Within and Oblivion Ring provide removal options, while Day of Judgment serves as a board wipe when needed. Gavony Township helps to pump up the tokens even further for a final blow."
