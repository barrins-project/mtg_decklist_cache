It also includes cards like Unburial Rites to bring back creatures from the graveyard. The deck has a mix of card draw and board wipes to out-value opponents. Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption while cards like Think Twice and Forbidden Alchemy help with card selection. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistent access to all colors."
