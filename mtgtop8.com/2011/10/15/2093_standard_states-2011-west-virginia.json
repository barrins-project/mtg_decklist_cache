The deck's strategy revolves around using Birthing Pod to constantly upgrade creatures, while also having access to cards like Elesh Norn and Molten-Tail Masticore for additional control and threats. By utilizing a combination of creatures with enter-the-battlefield effects and powerful late-game threats, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents through efficient creature interactions."
