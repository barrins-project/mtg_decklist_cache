By making use of cards like Grand Abolisher and Gideon's Lawkeeper to provide protection and disruption, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of powerful weenies. Geist of Saint Traft and Angelic Destiny can provide additional threats and evasion, while cards like Oblivion Ring offer removal options. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive nature of the deck with a mix of lands that enable consistent plays."

The deck aims to slow down the opponent's game plan by countering key spells, removing threats from the board, and generating card advantage through cards like Forbidden Alchemy and Snapcaster Mage. Additionally, the deck has the ability to reanimate powerful creatures like Sun Titan and Grave Titan using Unburial Rites, providing additional threats and value. Overall, the deck's strategy revolves around establishing control of the game and outvaluing the opponent in the late game."
