The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's plans with cards like Mana Leak and Doom Blade, while also generating card advantage with Snapcaster Mage and Think Twice. Additionally, the deck includes powerful threats like Frost Titan and Wurmcoil Engine to close out the game. Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and Karn Liberated can help with both removal and card advantage. Overall, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and secure victory through control tactics."
