The deck includes various creatures that provide mana acceleration, such as Birds of Paradise and Viridian Emissary, and removal spells like Beast Within and Slagstorm to handle opponent's threats. The deck also includes powerful threats like Primeval Titan and Wurmcoil Engine to close out games. The inclusion of cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Garruk, Primal Hunter provide additional versatility and card advantage."
