The deck also utilizes card draw and graveyard recursion with Forbidden Alchemy and Unburial Rites to outvalue opponents in the late game. With planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Jace, Memory Adept to provide additional pressure and disruption, this deck aims to control the game until it can secure a win with its powerful threats and versatile removal options."
