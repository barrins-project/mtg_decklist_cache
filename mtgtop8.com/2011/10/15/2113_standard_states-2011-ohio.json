The mana base is designed to ensure consistent white mana sources for casting spells."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to ramp up quickly using mana-generating creatures and spells like Palladium Myr, Solemn Simulacrum, and Rampant Growth, in order to cast powerful creatures such as Primeval Titan, Myr Battlesphere, and Wurmcoil Engine. The deck also includes cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Sphere of the Suns to help search for and fix mana. Additionally, the inclusion of Kessig Wolf Run and Karn Liberated gives the deck a strong late-game plan to close out the match. The deck overall focuses on controlling the board and overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats."
