The deck also aims to maintain card advantage by utilizing cards like Snapcaster Mage and Forbidden Alchemy. It includes a mix of creature removal, counterspells, and card draw to control the game until it can drop powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine or Karn Liberated. The deck is designed to outvalue the opponent and ultimately win through incremental advantage and superior card selection."
