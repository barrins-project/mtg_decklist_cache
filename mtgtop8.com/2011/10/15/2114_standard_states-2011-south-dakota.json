It includes cards like Goblin Fireslinger, Stromkirk Noble, and Incinerate to deal damage to the opponent and control the board. The key strategy is to keep the pressure on the opponent with early aggression and finish them off with burn spells like Brimstone Volley and Shrine of Burning Rage. Koth of the Hammer provides additional mana acceleration, while Chandra's Phoenix offers resilience and recurring damage. Overall, the deck aims to win the game quickly through efficient and aggressive plays."
