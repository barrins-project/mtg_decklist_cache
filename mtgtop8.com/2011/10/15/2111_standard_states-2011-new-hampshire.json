The goal is to disrupt your opponent's strategy, draw extra cards, and eventually overwhelm them with threats that are difficult to deal with. Combining blue and red spells with a splash of black for extra versatility, this control deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a Standard 1 vs 1 format."
