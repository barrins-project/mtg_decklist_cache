The strategy is to consistently apply pressure on the opponent with creatures like Stromkirk Noble and Stormblood Berserker, while finishing them off with direct damage spells like Incinerate and Brimstone Volley. The inclusion of powerful planeswalker Koth of the Hammer helps generate extra mana and provide additional threats. With a low mana curve and efficient removal spells like Arc Trail, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
