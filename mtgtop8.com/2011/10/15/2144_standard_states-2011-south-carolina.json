            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to control the board with removal spells like Beast Within and Slagstorm while ramping up with cards like Rampant Growth and Green Sun's Zenith to quickly get out powerful threats like Primeval Titan and Wurmcoil Engine. The deck focuses on utilizing Kessig Wolf Run to give its creatures trample and finish off opponents quickly. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Acidic Slime and Solemn Simulacrum for extra removal and card advantage. Overall, the strategy revolves around controlling the game and overwhelming opponents with powerful creatures."
