Use cards like Angelic Destiny to boost your creatures and maintain pressure on the opponent. Additionally, utilize protection and disruption spells like Apostle's Blessing and Mana Leak to protect your threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Use the combination of creatures and spells to quickly establish dominance on the battlefield and close out the game before your opponent can recover."
