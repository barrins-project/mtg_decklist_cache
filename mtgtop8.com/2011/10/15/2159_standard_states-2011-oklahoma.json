The deck includes card advantage with Snapcaster Mage and Ponder, and can recover from aggressive strategies with Timely Reinforcements. The goal is to control the game until a win condition can be established, often through the use of equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine or a planeswalker like Gideon Jura."
