Additionally, the deck looks to gain card advantage through card draw spells like Think Twice and Forbidden Alchemy, and recursion with cards like Sun Titan and Unburial Rites. The deck also has a reanimator subtheme with the ability to bring back powerful creatures like Wurmcoil Engine. Liliana of the Veil and Jace, Memory Adept provide additional disruption and card advantage to help maintain control of the game."
