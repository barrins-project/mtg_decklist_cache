Cards like Intangible Virtue and Honor of the Pure pump up and buff these tokens, making them formidable threats. Elspeth Tirel and Gavony Township provide additional ways to boost the tokens' strength. With the ability to quickly overwhelm opponents with a large number of creatures, this deck aims to end the game swiftly through aggressive attacks and token synergies."
