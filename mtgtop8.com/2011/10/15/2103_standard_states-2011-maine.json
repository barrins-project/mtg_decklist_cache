It includes powerful finishers like Frost Titan and Grave Titan to close out the game once control has been established. The deck also utilizes graveyard recursion with cards like Forbidden Alchemy and Snapcaster Mage to maintain card advantage. It has a mixture of removal spells and disruptive creatures to deal with threats from the opponent. The goal is to slow down the opponent's game plan and win through attrition and card advantage."
