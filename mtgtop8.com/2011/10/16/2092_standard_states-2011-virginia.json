By utilizing cards like Doom Blade, Mana Leak, and Oblivion Ring, you can remove threats from the board while protecting your own creatures with Timely Reinforcements and Day of Judgment. The deck also has strong card draw potential with Forbidden Alchemy and Think Twice, allowing you to find answers to your opponent's threats. Sun Titan and Unburial Rites provide late-game value by bringing back powerful creatures from the graveyard."
