It relies on powerful creatures like Consecrated Sphinx and Wurmcoil Engine for late-game win conditions. The deck also includes versatile planeswalkers like Jace, Memory Adept and Karn Liberated for additional control and card advantage. By disrupting the opponent's strategy and maintaining card advantage, this Dimir Control deck aims to outlast opponents and secure victory through gradual attrition."
