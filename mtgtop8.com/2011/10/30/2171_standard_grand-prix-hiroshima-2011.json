By using mana acceleration cards like Birds of Paradise and Avacyn's Pilgrim, you can ramp into your powerful threats even faster. Garruk Relentless and Elspeth Tirel provide additional support and removal options. Cards like Oblivion Ring and Mortarpod help deal with pesky threats your opponents may play. Gavony Township can buff up your creatures and push through for lethal damage. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm your opponent with a fast and powerful aggro strategy."

By employing aggressive creatures like Grim Lavamancer, Stromkirk Noble, and Stormblood Berserker, along with burn spells like Incinerate and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Chandra's Phoenix and Shrine of Burning Rage provide additional reach and damage potential, while Koth of the Hammer offers ramp and additional firepower."
