It utilizes cards like Lotus Bloom, Rite of Flame, Seething Song, and Shivan Reef to generate large amounts of mana quickly. By using cards like Sleight of Hand, Telling Time, and Remand, the deck can dig for key combo pieces and control the game state. The ultimate goal is to cast Dragonstorm, searching the library for multiple Bogardan Hellkites and/or Hunted Dragons to deal massive amounts of damage and overwhelm the opponent."

The strategy centers around playing creatures like Kird Ape and Scab-Clan Mauler early on to deal damage quickly, while also using burn spells like Char and Seal of Fire to finish off opponents or clear the way for attacks. The inclusion of cards like Magus of the Scroll and Tin Street Hooligan provides additional utility and disruption to keep the opponent on their toes."

By using cards like Remand, Mana Leak, Spell Snare, and Wrath of God to control the board, combined with card draw from Compulsive Research and Tidings, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents. Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir helps to further control the game by limiting opponents' ability to interact on their turn. The deck also includes some win conditions like Triskelavus and Draining Whelk to close out games once the opponent has been sufficiently controlled."
