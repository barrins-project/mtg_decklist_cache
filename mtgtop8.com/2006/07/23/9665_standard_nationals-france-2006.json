Cards like Glorious Anthem and Nagao, Bound by Honor enhance the power of these creatures, while Umezawa's Jitte provides additional utility and removal options. The inclusion of Shining Shoal and Eight-and-a-Half-Tails adds additional protection and combat tricks to keep the aggressive strategy going. The deck also includes some control elements with Azorius Guildmage and Kami of Ancient Law, offering additional flexibility in dealing with opposing threats."

            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to generate a quick and aggressive tempo using low-cost creatures like Isamaru, Hound of Konda and Nantuko Husk. It also focuses on controlling the board with removal spells like Mortify and Orzhov Pontiff, while gaining life through Ghost Council of Orzhova. The deck aims to maintain card advantage with Dark Confidant and generate additional creatures with Promise of Bunrei. The inclusion of Shining Shoal and Umezawa's Jitte adds additional combat tricks and boosts the power of the creatures in combat."
