In addition, it has a small reanimation package with cards like Zombify and Yosei, the Morning Star to bring back powerful creatures. The deck also features some card draw and filtering effects with Compulsive Research and Court Hussar. The mana base is built to support all three colors of mana (Blue, White, Black) and includes utility lands like Eiganjo Castle and Minamo, School at Water's Edge."

By using cards like Glare of Subdual to control the board and Umezawa's Jitte to pump up your creatures, you can quickly build a threatening board presence. Additionally, cards like Watchwolf and Loxodon Hierarch provide strong bodies that are difficult for opponents to deal with. By utilizing the synergy between creatures and enchantments, this deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent and secure a quick victory."
