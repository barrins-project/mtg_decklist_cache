Umezawa's Jitte is key in giving our creatures additional power and keeping the board under control. The inclusion of Ninjas like Ninja of the Deep Hours adds an element of surprise and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure while maintaining control over the game tempo."
