By utilizing cards like Sosuke's Summons, Patagia Viper, and Coiling Oracle, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and apply pressure. It also includes disruptive spells like Remand and Mana Leak to control the game tempo. The addition of powerful cards like Umezawa's Jitte and Coat of Arms further enhances the deck's aggro strategy. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive nature of the deck while also providing flexibility for the player."
