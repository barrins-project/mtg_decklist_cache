By continuously milling their opponent's library with cards like Ruin Crab and Drown in the Loch, the deck aims to deplete their resources and win through card advantage. Control spells like Heartless Act and Drown in the Loch help in dealing with threats, while cards like Soaring Thought-Thief and Thieves' Guild Enforcer can chip away at the opponent's life total. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion provides additional value and recursion for the deck's creatures."

By using a combination of aggressive creatures and powerful enchantments, this deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent can fully set up their defenses."
