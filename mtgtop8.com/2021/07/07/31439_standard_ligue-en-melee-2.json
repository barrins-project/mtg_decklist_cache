Thieves' Guild Enforcer adds pressure while cards like Heartless Act and Drown in the Loch help control the board. Into the Story provides card advantage, while Lurrus of the Dream-Den allows for recursion of key creatures. The deck also includes counterspells like Mystical Dispute and Didn't Say Please to protect your board state. The overall strategy is to disrupt the opponent's plans while steadily grinding them down through milling."
