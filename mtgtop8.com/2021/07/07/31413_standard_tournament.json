By utilizing cards like Drown in the Loch, Into the Story, and Test of Talents, it aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining card advantage. The deck also includes efficient creatures like Ruin Crab, Thieves' Guild Enforcer, and Soaring Thought-Thief to pressure the opponent and win the game through mill or damage. With Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion, the deck has additional recursion and value to outlast opponents in longer games."
