            "notes": "This deck is focused on quickly building a board presence with aggressive creatures like Winota, Joiner of Forces, Luminarch Aspirant, and Blade Historian. By using these creatures along with cards like Usher of the Fallen and Rimrock Knight, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful attacks and trigger Winota's ability to put even more pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Elite Spellbinder and Skyclave Apparition helps to disrupt the opponent's strategy, while Bonecrusher Giant offers removal and added damage. The deck's mana base allows for consistent casting of its spells and creatures."
