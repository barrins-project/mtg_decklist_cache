The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering their spells and removing their threats, while also generating card advantage through card draw and recycling spells. It utilizes creatures like Gurmag Angler and Ninja of the Deep Hours to apply pressure and further generate card advantage through their abilities. The deck efficiently manages its resources through careful card selection and manipulation, allowing it to outlast and outplay opponents."
