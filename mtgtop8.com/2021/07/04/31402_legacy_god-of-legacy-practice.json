It utilizes powerful combo pieces like Natural Order to search for game-ending threats like Craterhoof Behemoth, and Glimpse of Nature to draw through the deck rapidly. Support cards like Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger help to generate extra mana and untap creatures. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a horde of Elves and finish them off with a big attack or combo finisher."
