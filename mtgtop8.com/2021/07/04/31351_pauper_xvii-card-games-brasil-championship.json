Cards like Mutagenic Growth and Vines of Vastwood provide combat tricks and protection for our creatures, allowing us to push through damage and win the game quickly. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast creatures and pump spells to secure a win in the early turns of the game."
