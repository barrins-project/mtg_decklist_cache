The inclusion of Emergent Ultimatum allows the deck to tutor for game-winning combinations of cards. The companion Yorion, Sky Nomad provides additional value by blinking permanents for extra card advantage. Overall, the deck thrives on controlling the game and overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats."

By utilizing various creatures like Lovestruck Beast and Bonecrusher Giant, along with instant spells such as Saw It Coming and Spikefield Hazard, the goal is to maintain board control and pressure the opponent early in the game. Additionally, the inclusion of Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast allows for powerful creature plays, while Obosh, the Preypiercer serves as a powerful companion to enhance the deck's damage output. The deck also includes some card draw and counter spells to maintain consistency and protect key threats."
