By discarding cards and using Lion's Eye Diamond, you can take advantage of madness and graveyard synergies to overwhelm your opponent with aggressive creatures. The deck is focused on creating a fast and explosive start to put pressure on your opponent and win the game before they have a chance to establish their own game plan."
