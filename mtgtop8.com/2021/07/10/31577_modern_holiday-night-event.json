By utilizing cards like Cranial Plating and Urza's Saga, the deck can quickly turn small creatures into powerful threats. Emry, Lurker of the Loch serves as a recurring source of card advantage and mana ramp, while cards like Mishra's Bauble and Springleaf Drum help to ensure a consistent flow of artifacts. The goal is to apply pressure early and maintain tempo throughout the game."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Chalice of the Void and Condescend, while also generating card advantage with Thirst for Knowledge and Karn, the Great Creator's ability to tutor up silver bullet artifacts. The win condition comes from overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon."
