By utilizing cards like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Dragon's Rage Channeler along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to quickly pressure the opponent and close out the game before they can stabilize. The deck also includes card draw and filtering to maintain card advantage and consistency. Overall, the deck focuses on a strong early game and efficient use of resources to win quickly."
