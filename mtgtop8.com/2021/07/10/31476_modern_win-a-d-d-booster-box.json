The deck uses cards like Savor the Moment and Time Warp to gain extra turns, while also utilizing removal spells like Prismari Command and Lightning Bolt to maintain control. Teferi, Time Raveler provides additional utility and disruption, while Wrenn and Six help to recur lands and provide card advantage. The key strategy is to stall the game and assemble the combo pieces for a game-ending play."
