The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Blood Moon and Magus of the Moon, while generating card advantage with Seasoned Pyromancer. This deck aims to play threats like Bonecrusher Giant and Bloodbraid Elf to pressure the opponent and close out the game. The inclusion of cards like Klothys, God of Destiny and Scavenging Ooze provides additional value and resilience against graveyard strategies."
