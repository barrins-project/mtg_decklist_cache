By utilizing cards like Cavern Harpy, Barrin, and Parasitic Strix alongside Aluren, the deck aims to generate infinite value and eventually win the game through overwhelming card advantage or by assembling a win condition such as Academy Rector fetching a game-ending enchantment. The deck also includes disruption in the form of counterspells and removal to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
