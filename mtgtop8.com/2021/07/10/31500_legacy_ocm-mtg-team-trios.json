Cabal Therapy allows for disruption of the opponent's game plan, while Careful Study and Putrid Imp help with card selection and discarding. Land cards provide the mana needed to execute the combo."

It utilizes the synergy between creatures like Ice-Fang Coatl and Hullbreacher to generate card advantage and tempo swings. The deck also leverages powerful cards like Collected Company and Green Sun's Zenith to tutor for key creatures and apply pressure on the opponent. The main goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells, taking advantage of the versatility and efficiency of the cards in the deck."
