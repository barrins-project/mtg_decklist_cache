By efficiently using cards like Fireblast, Lightning Bolt, and Lava Spike, along with creatures like Thermo-Alchemist and Ghitu Lavarunner, the goal is to apply constant pressure and finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. Curse of the Pierced Heart also provides additional passive damage, while Searing Blaze and Skewer the Critics offer removal options when needed. With a streamlined strategy focused on direct damage, this deck aims to win through pure aggression."
