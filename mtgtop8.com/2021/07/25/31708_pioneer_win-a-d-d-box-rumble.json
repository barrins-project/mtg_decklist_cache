Additionally, this deck includes disruptive elements such as counterspells and removal spells to control the board and maintain pressure on the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of fast-paced aggression and strategic resource management."

The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion provides additional value by allowing the deck to recast key creatures or spells from the graveyard. The deck's game plan revolves around aggression and resource denial to secure victory."
