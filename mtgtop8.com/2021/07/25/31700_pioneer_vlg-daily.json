It uses powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Narset, Parter of Veils to generate card advantage and control the board. The win condition comes from resolving powerful spells like Magma Opus or Shark Typhoon, backed up by Torrential Gearhulk to recur them. The deck's strength lies in its ability to adapt to different matchups and consistently answer threats while generating its own advantage."
