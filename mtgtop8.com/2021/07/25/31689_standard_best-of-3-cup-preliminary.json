It leverages the Izzet color combination's flexibility and high-powered creatures to maintain board control and out-value opponents. The deck runs a mix of removal, card draw, and threats to handle a variety of opposing strategies and is designed to disrupt the opponent's game plan while steadily advancing its own."
