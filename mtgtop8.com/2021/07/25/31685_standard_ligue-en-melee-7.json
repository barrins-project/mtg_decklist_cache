By utilizing cards like Luminarch Aspirant and Skyclave Apparition, along with powerful equipments such as Shadowspear and Maul of the Skyclaves, the deck aims to maintain board presence and apply constant pressure to the opponent. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Drannith Magistrate and Elite Spellbinder provides disruption to opposing strategies, allowing the deck to stay ahead in the game."
