By utilizing card draw engines like Mystic Forge and Grinding Station, along with recursion cards like Scrap Trawler and Myr Retriever, the deck aims to consistently dig through the deck for combo pieces and win conditions. Urza's Saga provides additional value by tutoring for key artifacts, while Mishra's Bauble and Chromatic Star provide additional card filtering and advantage. The deck's key strength lies in its ability to generate explosive turns and overwhelm opponents with its combo potential."

By utilizing cards like Stormwing Entity, Monastery Swiftspear, and Soul-Scar Mage, the deck aims to quickly deal damage to the opponent while maintaining control of the board with counterspells like Brazen Borrower and removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Dart. The deck also includes cards like Mutagenic Growth and Manamorphose to help with card advantage and mana efficiency, allowing for explosive turns to finish off the opponent swiftly."
