By combining low-cost creatures like Lazotep Reaver and Carrion Feeder with removal spells like Defile, the deck aims to apply pressure early and often. Additionally, the deck has resilient creatures like Ghoulraiser and Shepherd of Rot to bring back creatures from the graveyard, allowing for long-term advantage. The inclusion of cards like Crypt Incursion and Gempalm Polluter provides a way to gain life and finish off the opponent quickly."
