By using cards like Smallpox, Collective Brutality, and Unmarked Grave to disrupt your opponent's hand and board, you can control the game and eventually overwhelm them with powerful threats like Grave Titan and Archon of Cruelty. The deck also includes powerful synergies like Ephemerate and Persist to maximize value from your creatures and spells."

By using cards like Mishra's Bauble and Serum Visions to dig for more threats and disruption, this deck aims to stay ahead on board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a streamlined mana base and card selection, this deck can efficiently close out games with a mix of burn spells and evasive creatures."
