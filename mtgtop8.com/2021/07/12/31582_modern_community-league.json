The key strategy is to utilize Goblin tribal synergies with cards like Conspicuous Snoop and Goblin Matron to quickly search for and play key pieces like Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker and Sling-Gang Lieutenant for explosive combo finishes. With a mix of efficient creatures and powerful support cards like Aether Vial and Cavern of Souls, this deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents in fast-paced Modern matches."

Additionally, it has tools like Surgical Extraction and Assassin's Trophy to deal with problematic cards in the opponent's graveyard or battlefield. The deck's main goal is to lock the opponent out of the game and win through incremental advantage."
