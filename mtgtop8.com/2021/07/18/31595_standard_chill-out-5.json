            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to control the game through counterspells, card draw, and removal spells while utilizing the \"Teach by Example\" card to copy powerful spells. The deck aims to stall the opponent's game plan with counters like \"Disdainful Stroke\" and \"Saw It Coming\", while also disrupting their board state with removal spells like \"Frost Bite\" and \"Bonecrusher Giant\". The deck also includes powerful card draw spells like \"Graven Lore\" and \"Mazemind Tome\" to ensure a steady stream of resources. Additionally, the inclusion of snow lands allows for synergies with cards like \"Faceless Haven\" and \"Tasha's Hideous Laughter\"."
