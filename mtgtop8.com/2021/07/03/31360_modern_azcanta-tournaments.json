The inclusion of Lurrus as a companion allows for consistent recursion of key cards. The mana base is streamlined to ensure smooth casting of spells while keeping up pressure on the opponent. This deck is designed to be fast-paced and disruptive, aiming to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."

The deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Wrenn and Six and Liliana of the Veil to control the battlefield and generate incremental advantage. By combining efficient creatures, disruptive spells, and powerful planeswalkers, this Aggro Jund deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent and win through a combination of fast aggression and resource denial."
