The main strategy is to ramp into Niv-Mizzet Reborn as quickly as possible, using cards like Sylvan Caryatid and Omnath, Locus of Creation to fix mana and provide early game presence. The deck includes a mix of removal spells, counters, and versatile spells to adapt to various threats and situations. The companion, Yorion, Sky Nomad, provides additional value with its blink effect, allowing for repeated triggers of powerful Enter the Battlefield abilities."

It uses cards like Omen of the Sea and Cling to Dust to generate card advantage and maintain a strong hand. The deck also utilizes the companion Yorion, Sky Nomad to provide additional value and flexibility. Overall, the key concept is to control the game and outvalue the opponent's threats."

By playing aggressive creatures like Spectral Sailor and Ascendant Spirit, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with evasive threats and close out the game quickly. With support cards like Supreme Phantom and Curious Obsession, the deck is designed to maintain card advantage and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of counter spells like Spell Pierce and Miscast helps to protect your creatures and maintain tempo advantage."
