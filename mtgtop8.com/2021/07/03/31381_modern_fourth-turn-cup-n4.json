By efficiently deploying threats like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer, Dragon's Rage Channeler, and Murktide Regent, the deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent and close out the game quickly. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistency and allows for flexibility in casting spells with both blue and red requirements."
