Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a powerful companion, allowing for additional recursion of key cards. The goal is to apply pressure early and finish off the opponent with a big Zenith Flare to the face."

The goal is to consistently deal damage early and finish off opponents with powerful cards like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell. Castle Embereth provides additional damage potential while cards like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Robber of the Rich provide resilience and card advantage."
