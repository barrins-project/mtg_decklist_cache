Magda, Brazen Outlaw and Edgewall Innkeeper provide card advantage and ramp, while cards like Lovestruck Beast and Rimrock Knight help to establish early board presence. The inclusion of Shatterskull Smashing and Kazuul's Fury offer additional removal and reach, making it difficult for opponents to stabilize. The deck's overall strategy is to apply constant pressure and finish off the opponent before they can establish their game plan."

It includes plenty of card draw and counterspells to maintain board control and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The addition of Obosh as a companion adds an extra layer of aggression to the deck, making it even more threatening in the early game. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure smooth and consistent access to all the necessary colors for casting spells."
