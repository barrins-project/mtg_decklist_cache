            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to control the game by disrupting the opponent's strategies with counterspells, removal spells, and hand disruption like Thoughtseize. The deck aims to maintain card advantage through draw spells like Behold the Multiverse and Dig Through Time while using win conditions like Shark Typhoon and Ashiok, Nightmare Muse. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to both black and blue mana sources, allowing the player to cast a variety of spells at different stages of the game."
