The inclusion of Bring to Light allows for flexibility in tutoring for key spells, while removal spells like Dreadbore and Fatal Push help to deal with opposing threats. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's five-color requirements."

By utilizing cards like Dreadhorde Arcanist and Young Pyromancer to generate value and board presence, along with disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push to control the opponent's game plan, the deck aims to establish a dominant presence on the battlefield. The inclusion of Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger provides a powerful late-game threat that can disrupt the opponent's hand and close out the game. The deck's mana base is designed to support its aggressive curve and ensure consistent gameplay."
