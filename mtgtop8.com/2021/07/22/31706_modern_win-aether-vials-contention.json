The deck aims to quickly control the board and deal damage efficiently using cards like Lightning Bolt and Unholy Heat. The deck also includes card draw and selection to maintain consistency and find key pieces. By combining aggression with control elements, this deck looks to overwhelm opponents and secure victory in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."
