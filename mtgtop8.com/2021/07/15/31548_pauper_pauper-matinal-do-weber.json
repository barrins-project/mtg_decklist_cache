By using cards like Soul Warden, Essence Warden, and Blood Researcher, the deck aims to gain life consistently while playing creatures like Quirion Ranger and Saruli Caretaker to ramp up mana production. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to refill the hand with creatures, allowing for a continuous stream of threats to overwhelm the opponent. The overall strategy is to be aggressive early on and maintain pressure throughout the game."
