The key strategy is to establish an early board presence and keep up the aggression while disrupting the opponent with removal spells like Journey to Nowhere and Abrade. The deck also utilizes cards like Battle Screech and Rally the Peasants to go wide and overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of attackers. The main goal is to close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
