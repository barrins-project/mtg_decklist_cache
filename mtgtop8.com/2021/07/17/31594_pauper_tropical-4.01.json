The key win condition comes from casting Pestilence, which can clear the board of smaller creatures and ultimately take down the opponent's life total. The deck also utilizes card draw and hand disruption to maintain card advantage and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck includes a few creatures like Guardian of the Guildpact to help stabilize the board."
