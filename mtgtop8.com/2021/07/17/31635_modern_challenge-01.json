The deck aims to control the board and quickly close out the game by overwhelming the opponent with efficient threats. By utilizing a combination of versatile creatures, removal spells, and powerful planeswalkers, the deck is designed to maintain a proactive gameplay style and keep the opponent on the back foot throughout the match."
