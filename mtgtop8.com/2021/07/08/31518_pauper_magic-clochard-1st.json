By utilizing efficient creatures with abilities that allow for additional plays during the turn, combined with powerful combat tricks and enchantments to beef up the creatures, this deck aims to deal damage fast and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The key strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent while utilizing combat tricks to clear a path for your creatures to push through for lethal damage."
