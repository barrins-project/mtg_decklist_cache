By playing cards like Ruin Crab and Soaring Thought-Thief, the deck aims to mill the opponent's deck while disrupting their plays with counterspells like Saw It Coming and Drown in the Loch. Thieves' Guild Enforcer provides additional mill value while Lurrus of the Dream-Den allows for recurring key cards. The deck also includes some removal spells like Heartless Act and Dead Weight to deal with threats. Overall, the goal is to outlast the opponent by controlling the board and milling their deck."
