By utilizing cheap counterspells and bounce effects, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also capitalizing on efficient card draw and card selection. The deck's creatures, such as Ninja of the Deep Hours and Delver of Secrets, are difficult to block and can quickly close out the game if left unchecked."
