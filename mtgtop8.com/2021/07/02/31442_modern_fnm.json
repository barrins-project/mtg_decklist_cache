The inclusion of counterspells like Spell Pierce and Counterspell helps protect the deck's threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Lightning Bolt provides versatile removal and additional reach to close out games."

The deck also includes disruptive elements like Force of Negation and Counterspell to protect its threats. By combining efficient aggression with disruptive elements, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
