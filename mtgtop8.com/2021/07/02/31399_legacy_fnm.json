The deck focuses on deploying cheap creatures like Faerie Seer and Spellstutter Sprite to trigger Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow's ability to deal damage, and then uses Ninjas like Ingenious Infiltrator to draw cards and maintain card advantage. Aether Vial helps to cheat creatures into play, while cards like Snuff Out and Fatal Push provide removal options. The deck also includes a strong suite of counterspells to protect its threats."

By playing cards like Glimpse of Nature and Heritage Druid, combined with cards like Elvish Visionary and Wirewood Symbiote, the deck aims to quickly assemble a large board state and go for a game-winning combo with cards like Craterhoof Behemoth or Natural Order. Using cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Once Upon a Time helps to find the necessary pieces to execute the combo efficiently."
