The key strategy is to use Pestilence in combination with Pristine Talisman to continuously deal damage to creatures and players, ultimately gaining control of the board. Guardian of the Guildpact helps to protect against opposing threats, while cards like Chainer's Edict and Crypt Rats provide additional removal options. The mana base is focused on gaining life through lands like Radiant Fountain and Kabira Crossroads, ensuring the ability to sustain the control strategy."
