The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with hard to deal with creatures like Shardless Agent and Bonecrusher Giant, while also being able to control the game with cards like Cryptic Command and Force of Negation. By cascading into powerful spells like Crashing Footfalls and Violent Outburst, the deck aims to close out games quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
