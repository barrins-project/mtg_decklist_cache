By playing low-cost creatures like Sarulf's Packmate and Serrated Scorpion, the deck can establish a strong board presence early on. Cards like Feed the Serpent provide necessary removal to deal with opposing threats. The deck also includes some card draw options like Llanowar Visionary and Professor of Zoomancy to maintain card advantage. With a mix of powerful creatures and removal spells, this deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out games quickly."
