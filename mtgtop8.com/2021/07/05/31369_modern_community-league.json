By utilizing cards that disrupt the opponent's game plan like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Meddling Mage, while also boosting the power of your own creatures with Thalia's Lieutenant and Champion of the Parish, the deck aims to establish an early board presence and quickly end the game before the opponent can stabilize. Aether Vial is crucial for consistent creature deployment, and the mana base is designed to support the deck's mana requirements."
