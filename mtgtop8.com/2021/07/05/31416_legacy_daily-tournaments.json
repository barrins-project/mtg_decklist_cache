The inclusion of Standstill allows the player to draw cards while their opponents are hesitant to cast spells, and Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer provides additional card advantage and pressure on the board. The deck also includes win conditions in the form of Murktide Regent and Retrofitter Foundry, ensuring that the player can close out the game once they have established control."
