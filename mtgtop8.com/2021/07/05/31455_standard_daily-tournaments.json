By using cards like Ruin Crab, Thieves' Guild Enforcer, and Drown in the Loch, the deck aims to deplete the opponent's library while also keeping their board in check. Soaring Thought-Thief and Into the Story provide card advantage, while Lurrus of the Dream-Den offers recursion for important creatures. With a mix of control elements and mill strategies, the deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a 1 vs 1 setting."
