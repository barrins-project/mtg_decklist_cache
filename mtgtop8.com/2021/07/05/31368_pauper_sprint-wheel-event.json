By combining artifacts like Prophetic Prism and Darksteel Citadel with cards like Atog and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to create a fast-paced, aggressive strategy that overwhelms the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. Cards like Thoughtcast and Ichor Wellspring provide card draw to keep the engine running smoothly, while cards like Fling and Temur Battle Rage offer additional ways to close out the game quickly."
