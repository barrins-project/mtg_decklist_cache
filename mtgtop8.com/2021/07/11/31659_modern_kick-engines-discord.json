The key strategy involves using cards like Ad Nauseam, Angel's Grace, and Phyrexian Unlife to draw and protect combo pieces, while using mana ramp with Lotus Bloom and Pentad Prism. The win condition typically involves resolving Ad Nauseam with a library of zero cards, and using Spoils of the Vault to find and play Thassa's Oracle to win the game instantly. The deck aims to win before the opponent can disrupt the combo."

Emry, Lurker of the Loch provides recurring value, while Mishra's Bauble and Thought Monitor offer additional card draw. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Bone Shards and Metallic Rebuke to control the board and protect its aggressive game plan. Overall, it aims to create a fast-paced and resilient offense that can dominate the early game."
