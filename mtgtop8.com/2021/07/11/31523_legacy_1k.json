It also includes disruption in the form of Mox Diamond, Wasteland, and removal spells like Swords to Plowshares to control the game. The deck utilizes the synergy between lands and creatures to generate advantage and secure the victory through a powerful 20/20 flying indestructible Marit Lage token. The main goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and unstoppable combo finish."
