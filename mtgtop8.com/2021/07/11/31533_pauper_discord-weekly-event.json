            "notes": "The main concept of the deck is to quickly flood the board with low-cost artifacts and overwhelm the opponent with aggro tactics. By playing cards like Carapace Forger, Myr Enforcer, Frogmite, Sojourner's Companion, and Atog, the deck can generate a lot of early pressure. The inclusion of various artifact lands and mana-fixing cards like Springleaf Drum and Prophetic Prism allows for efficient resource management. The deck also utilizes direct damage spells like Galvanic Blast and Fling for additional reach and finishing off opponents. The overall strategy revolves around aggression, card draw, and strategic use of artifacts."
