It also aims to generate value through sacrificing creatures and drawing cards. The key strategy is to outvalue your opponent by efficiently removing threats and gaining card advantage while building up your own board presence. The deck includes a mix of removal spells, creatures with powerful abilities, and lands that provide flexibility in mana production. Ultimately, the goal is to establish a dominant board state and overwhelm your opponent with card advantage and powerful creatures."

Elite Spellbinder disrupts opponents' game plans while Clarion Spirit provides additional value for attacking. The mana base allows for consistent plays and ensures a smooth curve for a strong early game."
