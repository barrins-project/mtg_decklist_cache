Creatures like Lovestruck Beast, Questing Beast, and Werewolf Pack Leader put pressure on the opponent while cards like Gemrazer and Primal Might provide removal and pump up your creatures. The Great Henge offers card draw and life gain, while Ranger Class and Faceless Haven provide additional threats. With a solid mana base of Snow-Covered Forests, this deck aims to curve out efficiently and win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
