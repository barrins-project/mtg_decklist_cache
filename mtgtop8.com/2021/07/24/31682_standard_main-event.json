The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy while ensuring consistent access to all colors needed for the deck."

The mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility, allowing the deck to curve out smoothly and apply pressure early on. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, impactful creatures and close out the game swiftly."
