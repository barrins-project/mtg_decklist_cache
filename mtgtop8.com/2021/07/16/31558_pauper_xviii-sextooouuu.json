By continuously casting burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Fireblast, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. Thermo-Alchemist and Ghitu Lavarunner provide additional damage output, while Searing Blaze and Rift Bolt offer versatile removal options. Curse of the Pierced Heart adds consistent damage over time, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. The deck's strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and efficient burn spells before they can establish a defense."
