By playing efficient creatures like Lovestruck Beast and Werewolf Pack Leader, combined with powerful support cards like Showdown of the Skalds and Ranger Class, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on and maintain tempo throughout the game. The deck also includes removal options like Giant Killer and Bonecrusher Giant to deal with threats and keep the opponent on the back foot. Overall, the key concept is to outpace and outmuscle the opponent to secure a quick victory."
