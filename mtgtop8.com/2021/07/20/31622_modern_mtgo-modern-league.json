It utilizes creatures with flash and enter-the-battlefield effects to disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain tempo. Aether Vial helps cheat creatures into play, while cards like Ephemerate provide additional value. Teferi, Time Raveler gives the deck an edge against control decks. The mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility, allowing for a smooth curve of threats. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain control throughout the game."

By chaining together various creatures, such as Omnath, Locus of Creation and Chancellor of the Forge, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a wide board presence and potent threats. Additionally, cards like Risen Reef and Seasoned Pyromancer provide additional card advantage and board presence, while combo pieces like Wavesifter allow for explosive plays. The deck's strategy revolves around explosive combos and overwhelming the opponent with a flood of creatures."
