            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly build up a powerful board presence by utilizing +1/+1 counters and modular abilities. By leveraging cards like Hardened Scales and The Ozolith, along with creatures like Arcbound Ravager and Walking Ballista, players can overwhelm their opponent with a growing army of creatures. Urza's Saga helps to find key pieces like Hangarback Walker or Animation Module to further increase the strength of the board. This aggressive strategy aims to put pressure on the opponent early and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
