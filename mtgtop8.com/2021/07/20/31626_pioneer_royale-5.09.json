The deck also aims to generate card advantage through cards like Dig Through Time and Behold the Multiverse, while using planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Elspeth, Sun's Champion to provide additional value and board presence. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements efficiently."
