            "notes": "The main idea of this Rakdos Aggro deck is to quickly generate value and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures like Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and Seasoned Pyromancer, along with the recurring synergy between Witch's Oven, Cauldron Familiar, and Feasting Troll King. The deck also utilizes The Underworld Cookbook and Asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar to filter through the deck and provide additional resources. With a mix of aggressive creatures, resource generation, and recurring threats, this deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain board presence throughout the game."
