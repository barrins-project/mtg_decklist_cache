By consistently milling the opponent's library, the deck aims to win by emptying their library and causing them to lose the game when they draw a card and can't. The deck also includes cards like Fatal Push and Drown in the Loch for control and removal, as well as cards like Surgical Extraction to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The goal is to execute the milling combo efficiently and prevent the opponent from stopping it."

The main win condition involves casting Emrakul, the Aeons Torn with the help of Through the Breach to quickly close out the game. Wrenn and Six provide recurring value and help stabilize the mana base, while Prismari Command offers flexibility and utility. The deck aims to control the game until it can assemble the combo and overwhelm the opponent with a massive creature and potentially extra turns."
