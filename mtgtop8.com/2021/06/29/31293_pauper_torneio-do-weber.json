It includes cards that allow for card draw and creature recursion to maintain pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes a small life gain element with Gray Merchant of Asphodel to help close out games. Overall, the strategy is to outpace the opponent with aggressive creatures and disruptive spells in order to secure a victory."
