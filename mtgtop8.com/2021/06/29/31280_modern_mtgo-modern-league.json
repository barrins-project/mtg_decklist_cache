The key concept is to use cards like Eldritch Evolution and Chord of Calling to tutor for specific creatures and create powerful synergies on the battlefield. The deck includes creatures like Grist, the Hunger Tide, Geralf's Messenger, Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons, and Yawgmoth, Thran Physician, which all have abilities that can be leveraged for various combo interactions. Additionally, cards like Strangleroot Geist and Young Wolf provide resilience and potential for repeated value. The land base supports the deck's strategy, ensuring consistent mana production."
