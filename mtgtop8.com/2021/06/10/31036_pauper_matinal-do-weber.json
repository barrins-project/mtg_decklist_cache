By utilizing cards like Thermo-Alchemist and Ghitu Lavarunner to consistently deal damage, combined with powerful burn spells like Fireblast, Lightning Bolt, and Lava Spike, the goal is to reduce the opponent's life total as fast as possible. The inclusion of Curse of the Pierced Heart helps to steadily chip away at the opponent's life total while maintaining pressure. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of damage spells and aggressive creatures."
