By playing powerful threats like Elder Gargaroth and Valki, God of Lies, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value through blinking permanents for extra enter-the-battlefield triggers. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game and leveraging its powerful cards to secure victory."
