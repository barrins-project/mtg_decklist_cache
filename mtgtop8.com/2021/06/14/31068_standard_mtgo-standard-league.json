It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while generating value through cards like Mazemind Tome and Omen of the Sea. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by blinking permanents for extra ETB triggers. The deck also includes versatile threats like Shark Typhoon and Crawling Barrens to close out the game. Ultimately, the deck seeks to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
