By efficiently utilizing creatures like Bone Picker and Gray Merchant of Asphodel, along with removal spells like Tendrils of Corruption and Chainer's Edict, the deck aims to control the board while dealing damage quickly. The inclusion of cards like Crypt Rats and Pestilence provide additional board control options, making it difficult for the opponent to establish a strong defense. Overall, the deck focuses on maintaining pressure and controlling the game tempo to secure victory."
