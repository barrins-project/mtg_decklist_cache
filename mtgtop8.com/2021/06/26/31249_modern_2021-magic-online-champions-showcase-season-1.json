By casting spells with cascade, such as Violent Outburst, the deck aims to cheat powerful cards onto the battlefield for little to no mana cost. Cards like Crashing Footfalls and Shardless Agent provide additional value and board presence. The deck also features disruptive elements like Cryptic Command and Force of Negation to control the game and protect its own board state. The land base is optimized for fetching the necessary colors of mana quickly and efficiently."
