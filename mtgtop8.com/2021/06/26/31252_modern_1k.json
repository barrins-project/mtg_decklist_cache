The deck aims to maintain a fast pace of play, utilizing cards like Monastery Swiftspear, Soul-Scar Mage, and Dragon's Rage Channeler to pressure the opponent early on. Cards like Boros Charm and Lightning Bolt provide reach and removal, while the inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion offers additional consistency and recursion for the deck's threats. Combining aggression with removal and card advantage, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."

The deck focuses on generating card advantage and filtering through the library with cards like Serum Visions and Mishra's Bauble to ensure a consistent stream of threats and answers. The mana base is designed to support the deck's low-cost spells and provide consistency in hitting the right colors of mana."
