It uses control elements like Condescend, Remand, and Repeal to disrupt opponents while digging for more threats and answers with cards like Thirst for Knowledge and Expedition Map. Karn, the Great Creator provides additional utility with access to artifacts like Mindslaver and Oblivion Stone. The deck also includes interaction with Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Academy Ruins for additional value."
