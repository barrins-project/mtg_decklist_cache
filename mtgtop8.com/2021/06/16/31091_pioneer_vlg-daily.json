The deck also includes disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger serves as both a threat and a recurring source of damage. The deck's key strategy is to maintain a steady stream of threats while disrupting the opponent's strategy, ultimately overwhelming them with aggressive plays."
