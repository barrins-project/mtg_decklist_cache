This creates a powerful combo where you can sacrifice creatures to Altar of Dementia, triggering Bridge from Below and overwhelming your opponent with a swarm of zombies. Cabal Therapy is used for disruption and to further fuel your graveyard. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's fast, aggressive playstyle."
