The deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Nahiri, the Harbinger and Chandra, Torch of Defiance to generate card advantage and provide additional threats. The inclusion of cards like Boom / Bust and Cleansing Wildfire allows the deck to disrupt opponent's mana base, while cards like Vindicate and Prismatic Ending deal with threats efficiently. Additional win conditions such as Emrakul, the Aeons Torn provide a powerful late-game option."
