The strategy is to quickly build a wide board presence and apply pressure with cards like Luminarch Aspirant and Maul of the Skyclaves, while also gaining life and generating tokens with cards like Heliod, Sun-Crowned and Daxos, Blessed by the Sun. The deck aims to be fast and efficient, utilizing low-cost creatures and enchantments to outpace and outvalue the opponent."
