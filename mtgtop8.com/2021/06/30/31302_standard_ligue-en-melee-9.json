The pathway lands provide flexibility in mana fixing, while cards like Memory Leak and Negate offer disruption against the opponent's strategy."

By utilizing aggressive creatures like Questing Beast and Stonecoil Serpent, along with powerful support cards like The Great Henge and Primal Might, the deck aims to put constant pressure on the opponent and outpace them to secure victory. Additionally, the inclusion of Snow-Covered Forests helps to enable the powerful snow synergies in the deck, providing additional flexibility and resilience in the face of opposing strategies."
