By quickly deploying threats like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Young Pyromancer, backed up by removal spells like Fatal Push and Kolaghan's Command, the deck looks to control the tempo of the game and chip away at the opponent's life total. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds consistent value over the course of the game. The deck's strategy is to maintain pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan to secure victory."
