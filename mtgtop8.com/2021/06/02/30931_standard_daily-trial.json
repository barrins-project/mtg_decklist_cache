By cycling through cards efficiently, the deck aims to fill the graveyard with cycling cards in order to power up Zenith Flare for massive damage. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value from the graveyard, while the various pathways provide consistent mana fixing for the deck's multiple colors. Ultimately, the goal is to maintain a steady offensive presence while having the flexibility to adapt and control the game."
