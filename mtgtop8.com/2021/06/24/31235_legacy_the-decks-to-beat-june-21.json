It also has a strong control package with cards like Brainstorm, Force of Will, and Daze to protect the combo pieces. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its powerful threats and disrupt their game plan with counterspells, while being able to win the game quickly with the cheated-in creatures. It is a fast-paced and powerful combo deck that can take opponents by surprise."
