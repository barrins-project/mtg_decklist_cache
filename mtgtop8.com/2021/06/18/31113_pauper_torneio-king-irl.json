By combining aggressive threats like Blastoderm and Annoyed Altisaur with powerful removal like Chainer's Edict and Pestilence, the deck aims to control the board while applying pressure to the opponent. Additionally, cards like Pulse of Murasa and Sarulf's Packmate provide card advantage and lifegain to help the deck grind out longer games. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements while also providing some utility in the form of Golgari Rot Farm and Bojuka Bog."
