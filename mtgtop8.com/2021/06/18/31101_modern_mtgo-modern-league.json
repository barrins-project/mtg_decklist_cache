This is supplemented by control elements like Drown in the Loch, Eliminate, and Fatal Push to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Surgical Extraction is used to remove key cards from the opponent's graveyard, while Archive Trap punishes them for searching their library. Visions of Beyond provides card draw, and Crypt Incursion helps gain life against aggressive decks. Overall, the deck aims to mill the opponent out before they can assemble their win condition."
