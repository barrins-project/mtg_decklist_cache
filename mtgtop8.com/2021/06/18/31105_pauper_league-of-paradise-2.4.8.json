The focus is on utilizing cheap creatures such as Sacred Cat and Lagonna-Band Trailblazer, while protecting them with enchantments like Ethereal Armor and Sentinel's Eyes. Key cards like Karametra's Blessing and Benevolent Bodyguard provide protection and resilience to removal spells. Overall, the strategy is to build a strong board presence quickly and maintain pressure on the opponent through efficient and aggressive creature plays."
