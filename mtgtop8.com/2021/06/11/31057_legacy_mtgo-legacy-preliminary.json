Once enough creatures are in the graveyard, you can use Hogaak and Vengevine to swarm the battlefield with tokens and overwhelm your opponent. Bridge from Below also plays a key role in generating additional tokens from sacrificed creatures. The deck focuses on combining graveyard recursion and sacrificing creatures for a powerful and aggressive strategy."
