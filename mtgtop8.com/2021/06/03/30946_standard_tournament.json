Utilizing powerful removal spells like Storm's Wrath and Doomskar to clear the way for attacks, this deck aims to pressure the opponent early and maintain a strong presence on the battlefield to overwhelm them before they can stabilize. Castle Ardenvale provides additional token generation to keep up the aggression."
