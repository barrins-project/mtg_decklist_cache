By combining efficient creatures and powerful enchantments, the deck aims to create a formidable board presence early in the game and maintain pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of protection spells such as Karametra's Blessing and Benevolent Blessing also helps to protect key creatures and ensure a strong offensive presence."
