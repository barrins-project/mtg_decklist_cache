The deck relies on fast mana and disruption to ensure it can execute its combo efficiently while controlling the opponent's board. By cycling through the deck quickly and setting up the right cards in the graveyard, the deck can overwhelm opponents with a sudden influx of powerful creatures, creating explosive turns and securing victory."
