This strategy is supported by Nahiri, the Harbinger, who can provide card advantage and removal, as well as Emrakul, the Aeons Torn for a powerful finisher. The deck also includes burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chandra planeswalkers for additional removal and reach, creating a versatile control deck that aims to dominate the game through resource denial and powerful threats."
