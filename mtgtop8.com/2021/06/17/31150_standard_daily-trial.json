The key strategy is to flood the board with creatures like Luminarch Aspirant, Seasoned Hallowblade, and Skyclave Apparition, while using cards like Selfless Savior and Alseid of Life's Bounty to protect them. Reidane, God of the Worthy disrupts the opponent's mana base, and Elite Spellbinder can hinder their key spells. The addition of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for consistent access to key creatures from the graveyard. The deck aims to maintain board presence and apply pressure early on to secure victory."
