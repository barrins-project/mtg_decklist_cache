By combining cards like Hidden Strings, Vizier of Tumbling Sands, and Pore Over the Pages, the deck can dig through its library to find key combo pieces and win conditions. Fae of Wishes serves as a flexible tutor, while cards like Arboreal Grazer and Sylvan Scrying help ramp and ensure the player can find their Lotus Fields consistently. The deck aims to create explosive plays and overwhelm the opponent with its combo potential."

The companion, Lurrus of the Dream-Den, provides additional value by allowing you to cast small creatures and burn spells from your graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
