By leveraging lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident, along with disruptive creatures such as Merfolk Trickster and Unsettled Mariner, the deck aims to control the battlefield and deal damage efficiently. The inclusion of Aether Vial helps to cheat creatures into play at instant speed, while spells like Force of Negation provide crucial protection. Ultimately, the strategy centers around establishing tempo and applying pressure early on to secure a victory."
