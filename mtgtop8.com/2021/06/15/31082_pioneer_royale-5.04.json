Utilizing cards like Rattlechains and Siren Stormtamer to protect key creatures while also providing card advantage through Spectral Sailor and Curious Obsession. Counterspells like Lofty Denial and Unsubstantiate help disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Supreme Phantom buff up all spirit creatures. Overall, this deck aims to maintain pressure and tempo while outpacing the opponent to secure a quick victory."
