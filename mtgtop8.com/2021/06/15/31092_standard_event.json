Utilizing cards like Fervent Champion, Anax, Hardened in the Forge, and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of snow-covered mountains allows for Frost Bite to be a versatile removal option. Embercleave serves as a powerful finisher, while Faceless Haven provides an additional threat. Overall, the deck's strategy revolves around fast-paced aggression and efficient removal."
