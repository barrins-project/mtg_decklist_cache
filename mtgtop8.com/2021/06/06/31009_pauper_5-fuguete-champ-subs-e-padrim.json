By using card draw, recursion, and counterspells, the deck aims to prolong the game until it can find its win condition, often by milling the opponent's deck or overwhelming them with a large life gain. The deck's key concept revolves around stall tactics, card advantage, and resource management to outlast the opponent and secure the victory."
