The deck also includes some card draw with Edgewall Innkeeper and Llanowar Visionary, as well as some removal and additional threats like Koma, Cosmos Serpent. The mana base is built to support the deck's three-color requirements and ensure consistency in casting spells."

The win condition comes from powerful creatures like Goldspan Dragon and Faceless Haven, backed up by spells like Alrund's Epiphany. The deck also includes a snow subtheme for additional synergy. With a mix of control elements, big threats, and card advantage, this deck aims to outmaneuver and outlast opponents in a drawn-out battle of attrition."
