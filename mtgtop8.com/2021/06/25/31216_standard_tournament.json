By focusing on utilizing cards like Hunt for Specimens, Cultivate, and Plumb the Forbidden to ramp up resources, the deck aims to maximize the value of powerful creatures like Professor Onyx and Garruk, Cursed Huntsman. With a mix of board wipes like Blood on the Snow and Extinction Event, along with disruptive spells like Go Blank, the Golgari Control deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain dominance throughout the game."
