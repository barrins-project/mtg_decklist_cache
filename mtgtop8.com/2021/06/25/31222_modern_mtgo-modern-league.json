The deck focuses on cards like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Seal of Fire to deal damage directly to the opponent, while also using creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage to apply pressure on the board. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds additional value by allowing for repetitive casting of low-cost spells from the graveyard. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, aggressive damage output."
