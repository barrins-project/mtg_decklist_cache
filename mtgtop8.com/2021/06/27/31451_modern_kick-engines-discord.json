By combining disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Unholy Heat with aggressive creatures, the deck puts pressure on opponents early and disrupts their game plan. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional recursion and value, making the deck resilient in longer games. With a mix of disruption, aggression, and card advantage, this deck aims to close out games swiftly in the Modern format."

The deck also includes some additional removal options in Lightning Bolt and Engineered Explosives to help control the board. Overall, the strategy revolves around setting up the combo while controlling the game."
