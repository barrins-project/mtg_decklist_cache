Utilizing Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion to provide additional value through blinking permanents, the deck runs a mix of removal, counterspells, board wipes, and card draw to control the game state. The deck also includes Emergent Ultimatum as a key win condition to search for powerful threats or game-ending spells. By efficiently managing threats and resources, this deck aims to grind out victories through incremental advantage and powerful late-game plays."
