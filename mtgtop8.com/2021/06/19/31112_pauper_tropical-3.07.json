By efficiently using direct damage spells and creatures that can deal damage each turn, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize or mount a defense. The inclusion of cards like Curse of the Pierced Heart also adds another way to steadily drain the opponent's life total while maintaining pressure."
