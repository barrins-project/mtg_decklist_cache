The deck has some card advantage and life gain options in Pulse of Murasa and Llanowar Visionary, and uses lands like Bojuka Bog and Mortuary Mire to disrupt opponents' strategies. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure while maintaining control over the game."

By combining aggressive creature strategies with efficient removal and card draw, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents before they can set up their own game plan. The inclusion of cards like Temur Battle Rage and Fling provide alternate win conditions that can catch opponents off guard. The mana base is carefully composed to support the artifact-heavy strategy, maximizing efficiency and consistency in casting powerful spells."
