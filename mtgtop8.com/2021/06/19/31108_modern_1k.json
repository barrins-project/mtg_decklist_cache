This is supported by cards like Snapcaster Mage, Drown in the Loch, Fatal Push, and Surgical Extraction to control the opponent's board and disrupt their strategy. Visions of Beyond and Crypt Incursion provide card draw and life gain respectively to sustain the mill strategy. The mana base is built with a mix of lands that provide both colors of mana and enable land destruction with Field of Ruin."

The deck also utilizes creatures with cycling abilities to help achieve this goal. The deck features counterspells like Force of Negation to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the key strategy is to set up a powerful board presence with a massive creature revival from the graveyard to overwhelm the opponent."
