The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by generating card advantage with Yorion, Sky Nomad and Emergent Ultimatum, and by playing threats like Elder Gargaroth and Polukranos, Unchained. The deck also utilizes powerful enchantments like Binding the Old Gods and planeswalkers like Kiora Bests the Sea God to further solidify its control over the game. Additionally, the deck includes ramp spells like Cultivate to help cast its big spells."
