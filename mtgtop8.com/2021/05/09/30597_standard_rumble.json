The deck relies on efficient creatures like Fervent Champion and Anax, Hardened in the Forge, along with powerful equipment like Embercleave to deal massive amounts of damage quickly. Cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Castle Embereth boost the damage output even further, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize and come back. Overall, the deck aims to win the game as fast as possible through relentless aggression."
