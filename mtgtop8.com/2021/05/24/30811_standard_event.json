By playing aggressive creatures like Luminarch Aspirant and Skyclave Apparition, while also disrupting the opponent's strategy with Drannith Magistrate and Elite Spellbinder, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early in the game. The inclusion of snow lands and Faceless Haven provides additional utility and resilience to removal spells. Overall, the deck relies on efficient weenie creatures and disruption spells to maintain board dominance and secure victories."

By gaining card advantage with Mazemind Tome and Expressive Iteration, the deck can set up big plays with Alrund's Epiphany and Magma Opus, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats like Goldspan Dragon and Galazeth Prismari."
