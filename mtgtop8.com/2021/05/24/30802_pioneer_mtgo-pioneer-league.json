This Aggro-Jund archetype focuses on generating incremental advantage through sacrificing creatures, dealing damage, and disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push. The deck also includes ways to ramp and fix mana with Gilded Goose and various pathways, allowing for a smooth and powerful aggressive strategy in Pioneer 1 vs 1 format."
