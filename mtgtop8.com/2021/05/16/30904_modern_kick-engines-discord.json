It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan through targeted discard spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, as well as removal spells like Fatal Push and Collective Brutality. Lingering Souls and Sedgemoor Witch help generate creature tokens to apply pressure, while Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and card advantage. The deck also includes Fulminator Mage to destroy opponent's lands and disrupt their mana base."
