The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Mystical Dispute and removal spells like Eliminate and Heartless Act, while also generating card advantage with Thirst for Meaning and Titans' Nest. The mana base is tuned to consistently hit all three colors (blue, black, green) and ensure smooth gameplay. By controlling the game and generating incremental advantages, this deck aims to grind out wins in a slow and methodical manner."
