By utilizing powerful threats like Titania, Protector of Argoth and Questing Beast, the deck can quickly close out games. The inclusion of key cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Sylvan Library allows for versatile gameplay and consistent access to key pieces. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue opponents with a combination of strong creatures and disruptive spells, while also utilizing lands like Wasteland for additional control."
