It also takes advantage of the Blood Moon card to disrupt opponent's mana bases. The inclusion of Obosh as a companion adds an additional source of damage. The main strategy is to efficiently use burn spells and creatures to deal damage quickly and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to establish their board."
