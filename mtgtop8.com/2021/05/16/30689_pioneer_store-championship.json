            "notes": "The deck focuses on a fast-paced, aggressive playstyle utilizing a combination of sacrifice effects and efficient removal spells. It aims to control the board early with cards like Fatal Push and Binding the Old Gods, while also generating value through recurring creatures like Cauldron Familiar and Woe Strider. The deck can also generate a lot of card advantage through Trail of Crumbs and Bolas's Citadel, allowing for explosive plays with Korvold, Fae-Cursed King. By constantly pressuring the opponent and disrupting their game plan, the deck aims to close out games quickly and efficiently."
