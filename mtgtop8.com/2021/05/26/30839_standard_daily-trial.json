The key win condition is to amass a large number of cycling cards and then finish off the opponent with a Zenith Flare, dealing damage equal to the number of cards cycled during the game."

The inclusion of cards like The Akroan War and Mazemind Tome provide additional control options, while Faceless Haven offers a reliable snow creature threat. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility, enhancing its overall control strategy."

Edgewall Innkeeper and Llanowar Visionary help with card draw and ramping, allowing you to play your higher cost spells like Koma, Cosmos Serpent and Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast. The deck also includes removal in the form of Fire Prophecy and The Akroan War, as well as some protection with Miscast. The mana base is optimized for the Temur colors, ensuring you have access to the right colors when needed."
