The inclusion of Jegantha as a companion provides additional versatility and consistency to the deck. The aggressive nature of the Naya Aggro archetype is reinforced by a mix of powerful creatures like Lovestruck Beast and Bonecrusher Giant, as well as disruptive elements like Elite Spellbinder and Drannith Magistrate. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure smooth mana development and support the aggressive game plan."

With efficient creatures like Fervent Champion and powerful equipment like Embercleave, the deck aims to deal massive damage early on in the game. Cards like Bonecrusher Giant provide removal options while Faceless Haven and Castle Embereth offer additional ways to close out the game. The strategy revolves around fast, high-powered plays to secure victory before the opponent can mount a defense."
