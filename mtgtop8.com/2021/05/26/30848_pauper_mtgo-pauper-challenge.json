The deck also includes various tools for recursive spells, like Ephemerate and Ghostly Flicker, to maximize the effects of key cards. By efficiently managing resources and stalling the game with Moment's Peace and Weather the Storm, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful late-game plays like Rolling Thunder."

It also focuses on card advantage by utilizing draw spells like Preordain, Brainstorm, and Thought Scour. The deck aims to gain control of the board with efficient creatures like Augur of Bolas, Gurmag Angler, and Ninja of the Deep Hours. The inclusion of Faerie Seer and Spellstutter Sprite adds disruption to the opponent's game plan. The deck's mana base is designed to provide flexibility and consistency in casting spells."
