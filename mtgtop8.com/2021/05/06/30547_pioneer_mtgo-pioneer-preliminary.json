The deck also utilizes Collected Company to quickly fill the board with creatures. With cards like Master of Waves and Risen Reef providing additional value and Thassa's Oracle as a potential win condition, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast, efficient aggro strategy in a Pioneer 1 vs 1 format."
