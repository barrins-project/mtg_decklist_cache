By cycling through your deck efficiently, you can find your powerful finisher, Zenith Flare, to close out the game. The deck also includes cards like Improbable Alliance to create additional threats and ways to deal damage. Utilizing cards that can cycle and cards that benefit from cycling allows for a fast and aggressive playstyle."

This synergizes with cards like See the Truth and Seize the Spoils to dig through the deck quickly and find combo pieces. The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Fire Prophecy and Prismari Command while setting up the combo pieces to eventually win the game with powerful creatures like Goldspan Dragon."
