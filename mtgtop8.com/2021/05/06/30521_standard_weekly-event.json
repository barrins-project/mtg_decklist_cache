By playing high-value creatures like Bonecrusher Giant and Robber of the Rich, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently to the opponent's life total. The inclusion of cards like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell further increases the deck's damage potential, allowing for explosive turns that can quickly end the game in favor of the player piloting the deck."
