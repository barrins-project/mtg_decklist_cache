The deck also includes combo pieces like Jace's Erasure to mill the opponent's deck while gaining card advantage. The inclusion of cards like Arcane Denial and Muddle the Mixture provides some disruption and counterplay options. Overall, the deck aims to control the game through fog effects and card advantage, leading to a win through milling or outlasting the opponent."

By combining cheap creatures with efficient enchantments, the deck aims to maintain a high level of pressure on the opponent and win the game before they can stabilize."
