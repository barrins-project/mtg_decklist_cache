            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressive plays, utilizing sacrifice effects and token generation to pressure the opponent. It aims to quickly deploy threats like Rankle, Master of Pranks and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger while also generating value through cards like Woe Strider and Village Rites. The combination of early aggression and recurring threats makes it difficult for opponents to stabilize, with Bastion of Remembrance providing additional reach. The deck aims to maintain constant pressure while also disrupting the opponent's game plan through sacrifice effects and efficient removal."
