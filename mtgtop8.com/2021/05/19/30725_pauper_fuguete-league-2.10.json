The creatures in the deck, like Slippery Bogle and Silhana Ledgewalker, are difficult to target or block, making it easier to maintain control of the board and continue dealing damage to the opponent. Additionally, cards like Utopia Sprawl and Abundant Growth provide mana ramp and fixing to ensure that the player can consistently cast their spells and maintain pressure on their opponent."
