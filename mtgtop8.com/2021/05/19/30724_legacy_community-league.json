By casting Aluren, the deck can then freely play its creatures without paying their mana costs, allowing for explosive combos and overwhelming the opponent with card advantage and tempo. The deck also runs disruptive cards like Force of Will and Plague Engineer to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own. The goal is to create a dominant board state and win through synergy and efficiency."
