Goldspan Dragon and Torbran boost the damage output, while Rimrock Knight and Robber of the Rich provide additional value. The deck also includes removal spells like Frost Bite to deal with opposing threats. The goal is to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out the game as quickly as possible. The mana base includes Snow-Covered Mountains and Faceless Haven for added versatility."
