By taxing their resources and preventing them from efficiently playing spells, you can quickly overwhelm them with aggressive creatures like Luminarch Aspirant and Spirit of the Labyrinth. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Kataki, War's Wage and Remorseful Cleric further disrupts their strategy, making it difficult for them to keep up. Utilizing powerful mana acceleration like the Moxen and efficient removal spells like Path to Exile, this deck aims to control the game and come out on top."
