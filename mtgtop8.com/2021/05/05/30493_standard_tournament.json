The deck also utilizes cards like Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose and Chevill, Bane of Monsters to drain the opponent's life total and gain advantage. The inclusion of Cosmos Elixir helps with card advantage and managing resources, while cards like Bloodchief's Thirst and Murderous Rider provide removal options. The Great Henge and The World Tree offer additional power and flexibility for the deck to maintain pressure and close out games efficiently."
