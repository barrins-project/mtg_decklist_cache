It also includes removal spells like Dismember and Fatal Push to control the board. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for recursion and additional value from the graveyard. The main goal is to apply pressure early in the game and close out matches swiftly with powerful creatures and burn spells."
