The deck relies on building a wide board presence quickly and buffing up its creatures with cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Rally the Ranks. It also features protection spells like Brave the Elements and Unbreakable Formation to keep the creatures safe and push through damage. The deck's overall strategy is to apply constant pressure on the opponent and win the game through aggressive combat."
