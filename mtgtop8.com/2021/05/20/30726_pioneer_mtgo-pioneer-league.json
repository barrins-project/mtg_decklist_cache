The deck focuses on using creatures like Rankle, Knight of the Ebon Legion, and Scrapheap Scrounger to deal damage quickly while also disrupting the opponent's hand with cards like Thoughtseize. Removal spells like Fatal Push and Murderous Rider help keep the board clear, while lands like Mutavault and Faceless Haven provide additional sources of damage. The strategy is to overwhelm the opponent and win the game as fast as possible."
