The deck also includes other powerful spells like Treasure Cruise and Crackling Drake to maintain card advantage and deal significant damage to the opponent. The inclusion of spells like Lightning Axe and Shock provides removal options while cards like Thing in the Ice can act as a disruptive element against opposing creatures. Overall, the deck focuses on a fast-paced, aggressive strategy centered around the recurring presence of Arclight Phoenix."

The deck also includes cards that can protect these creatures, such as Alseid of Life's Bounty and Selfless Savior. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with strong, buffed-up creatures early in the game and deal enough damage to win before the opponent can set up their own strategy."
