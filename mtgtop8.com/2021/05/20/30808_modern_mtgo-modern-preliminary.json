This combo relies on using cards like Conflagrate and Creeping Chill to deal damage to the opponent while also fueling the graveyard strategy. Life from the Loam helps to consistently bring back lands from the graveyard, and cards like Thrilling Discovery and Shriekhorn help to draw additional cards and fill up the graveyard even faster. The deck is built around fast, explosive plays that overwhelm the opponent."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on playing aggressively with creatures like Geist of Saint Traft and Ice-Fang Coatl, backed up by disruption spells like Mana Leak and Force of Negation. The main strategy is to quickly get ahead on board and use equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice and Maul of the Skyclaves to finish off the opponent. Teferi, Time Raveler helps to protect your creatures and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Stoneforge Mystic helps to tutor for the right equipment at the right time, while Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and control options."
