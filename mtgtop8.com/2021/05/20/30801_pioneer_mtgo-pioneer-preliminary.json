The mana base is built to support the red and blue spells needed to cast the Phoenix and other spells efficiently."

By playing aggressive creatures like Bonecrusher Giant and Goblin Chainwhirler, along with impactful spells such as Lightning Strike and Wild Slash, the deck aims to take control of the battlefield early on and deal consistent damage to the opponent. Supporting cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell provide additional firepower and synergies to pressure the opponent even more. With a mix of creature aggression and burn spells, this deck aims to quickly close out games before the opponent can respond."

By utilizing cards like Empyrean Eagle and Supreme Phantom to pump up the team, along with disruptive spells like Spell Queller and Lofty Denial, this deck aims to put pressure on the opponent while also maintaining control of the game. With efficient creatures and counterspells, the goal is to win the game quickly through a combination of flying damage and tempo advantage."
