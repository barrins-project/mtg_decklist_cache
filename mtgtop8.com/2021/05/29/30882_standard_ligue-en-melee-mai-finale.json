The deck focuses on playing aggressive, low-cost minions like Luminarch Aspirant and Seasoned Hallowblade to apply early pressure, while also utilizing disruptive creatures like Elite Spellbinder and Skyclave Apparition to control the opponent's plays. With cards like Showdown of the Skalds to refill your hand and powerful equipment like Maul of the Skyclaves to boost your creatures, this deck aims to close out games swiftly with an aggressive strategy."
