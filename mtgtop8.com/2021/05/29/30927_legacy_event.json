By utilizing a combination of cheap burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, along with powerful creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. Cards like Price of Progress and Fireblast add additional reach and explosiveness to help secure victory. The inclusion of Roiling Vortex also punishes opponents for playing noncreature spells, further increasing the deck's aggressive strategy."
