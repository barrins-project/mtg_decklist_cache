It utilizes cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Torrential Gearhulk for card advantage and controlling the opponent's hand. With spells like Fatal Push, Heartless Act, and Shadows' Verdict, the deck can efficiently deal with threats on the board. The deck also has a strong late-game plan with cards like Magma Opus and Shark Typhoon to close out the game. The mana base is carefully crafted to ensure consistency and flexibility in casting spells."
