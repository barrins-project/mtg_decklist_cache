By using low-cost, high-impact spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Boros Charm, combined with aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize. Eidolon of the Great Revel also punishes opponents for casting non-creature spells, further adding to the pressure. This aggressive strategy requires fast decision-making and careful resource management to maximize its effectiveness."
