By utilizing the cycling mechanic effectively, the deck can quickly close out games before the opponent can stabilize."

The deck aims to outvalue opponents with powerful planeswalkers such as Ashiok, Nightmare Muse and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and generates incremental advantage with Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion. The mana base is designed to support both early game interaction and late-game threats, with a mix of lands that provide colored mana and utility."
