The inclusion of Blood Moon disrupts opponents' mana bases, while Seasoned Pyromancer and Light Up the Stage provide card advantage. The presence of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion enhances the damage potential of odd-costed spells. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast-paced, aggressive strategy that can close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

            "notes": "The main idea of this Jeskai Control deck is to disrupt your opponent's game plan and control the board through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and powerful planeswalkers. With access to cards like Cryptic Command, Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, this deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents by disrupting their plays while generating card advantage and maintaining board presence through efficient removal and card draw spells. The deck also utilizes lands like Celestial Colonnade and Field of Ruin for additional control and utility."
