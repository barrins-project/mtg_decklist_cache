By combining aggressive creatures with counterspells and removal, the deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan. The inclusion of cards like Thorn of the Black Rose and Deep Analysis provides additional value and card advantage to stay ahead in resource management. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements while enabling consistent casting of spells."
