It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and eventually overwhelm them with high-impact threats like Vorinclex and Tergrid. The inclusion of snow lands allows for additional synergy with cards like Blood on the Snow and Reidane. The goal is to establish a dominating position on the battlefield and grind out a victory through incremental advantage."
