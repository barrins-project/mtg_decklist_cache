The deck uses counterspells like Saw It Coming and Mystical Dispute to disrupt the opponent, along with removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire and Frost Bite. The deck also includes card draw engines like Mazemind Tome and Expressive Iteration to help find key cards. The win conditions come from powerful threats like Goldspan Dragon and Galazeth Prismari, which can generate additional resources and pressure the opponent."
