The deck relies on cantrips like Reach Through Mists, Peer Through Depths, and Serum Visions to dig through the deck efficiently. Lotus Field is a key land in the deck, providing a large amount of mana when untapped."

By repeatedly dredging cards like Stinkweed Imp and Life from the Loam, the deck can trigger powerful effects like Creeping Chill and Conflagrate. The deck focuses on quickly filling the graveyard, recurring creatures from the graveyard, and dealing damage to the opponent through various synergies and combos. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Cathartic Reunion and Merchant of the Vale to help dig through the deck and find essential pieces."

Cards like Hedron Crab, Ruin Crab, and Mesmeric Orb help to mill the opponent while spells like Glimpse the Unthinkable and Maddening Cacophony speed up the process. Additionally, cards like Archive Trap and Surgical Extraction disrupt the opponent's strategy by removing key cards from their library. The deck aims to control the game by disrupting the opponent's resources while steadily milling them out."
