It aims to apply steady pressure on the opponent's life total while generating card advantage through cards like Phyrexian Rager and Sign in Blood. Gray Merchant of Asphodel serves as a finisher, draining the opponent's life when it enters the battlefield. The deck also utilizes creatures with evasion such as Bone Picker and Thorn of the Black Rose to close out games quickly. The mana base is heavily skewed towards black sources to ensure consistent casting of spells."
