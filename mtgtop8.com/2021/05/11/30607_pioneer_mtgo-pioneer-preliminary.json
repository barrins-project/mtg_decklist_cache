            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to assemble the Lotus Field combo as quickly as possible to generate a large amount of mana. This is achieved by using cards like Arboreal Grazer and Sylvan Scrying to find and untap Lotus Field. Once the combo is set up, the player can cast powerful spells like Emergent Ultimatum and Alrund's Epiphany to take control of the game. Teferi, Hero of Dominaria provides additional control and card advantage, while Discontinuity can disrupt the opponent's plans. The deck aims to win by overwhelming the opponent with powerful spells and mana advantage."
