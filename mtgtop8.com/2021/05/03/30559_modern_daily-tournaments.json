This strategy is supported by cards like Life from the Loam and Cathartic Reunion to fuel the graveyard with cards like Stinkweed Imp and Golgari Thug, and then capitalize on their abilities with Prized Amalgam and Bloodghast to overwhelm the opponent. The deck aims to create a powerful engine of recursion and damage output through consistent dredging and self-milling."
