By maximizing the number of humans in the deck, the goal is to consistently trigger Winota's ability and overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of attacking creatures. With cards like Selfless Savior and Alseid of Life's Bounty providing protection for key threats, the deck aims to close out games quickly with aggressive and efficient plays."
