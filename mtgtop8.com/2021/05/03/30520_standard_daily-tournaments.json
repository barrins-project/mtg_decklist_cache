By utilizing creatures with strong abilities such as protection, evasion, and recursion, the deck aims to maintain a steady stream of threats on the board. Key cards like Legion Angel and Luminarch Aspirant help to provide additional advantages and support for the aggressive strategy. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Faceless Haven and Castle Ardenvale offer flexibility and resilience in the late game, ensuring a strong continued presence on the battlefield."
