The deck also includes a few utility cards like Navigator's Compass and Witching Well for additional versatility. The key strategy is to overwhelm opponents with early aggression and efficient mana usage."

By utilizing card advantage and tempo plays, the deck aims to control the pace of the game while gradually developing a board presence. The inclusion of cheap removal spells, powerful counterspells, and creature-based card draw engines allows the deck to efficiently handle threats and outvalue opponents in the long run. The focus on control and disruption complements the strategy of slowing down the opponent's game plan and ultimately winning through incremental advantages."
