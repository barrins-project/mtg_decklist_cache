The deck focuses on using cantrips like Mishra's Bauble and Manamorphose to trigger prowess on creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Clever Lumimancer. Lightning Bolt and Lava Dart help clear the way for attacks, while Light Up the Stage provides card advantage. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast damage output and keep up the pressure throughout the game."
