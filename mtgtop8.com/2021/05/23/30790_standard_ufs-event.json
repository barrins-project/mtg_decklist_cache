The goal is to control the board with efficient creatures and utilize combat tricks and powerful equipment like Embercleave to push through damage and finish the game swiftly. The inclusion of snow lands allows for additional utility with cards like Faceless Haven and Frost Bite. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and maintain pressure throughout the game."
