The main goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful human creatures and win the game quickly."

By using cards like Scapeshift, the player aims to quickly assemble the combo of Valakut and enough Mountains to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent in one turn. Dryad of the Ilysian Grove helps fix mana and Courser of Kruphix provides card advantage. Lightning Bolt and Sweltering Suns offer removal options while Summoner's Pact helps find combo pieces."
