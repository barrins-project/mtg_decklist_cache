By utilizing Merfolk Trickster and Brazen Borrower to disrupt the opponent's game plan, coupled with Risen Reef and Master of Waves to create a wide board presence, this deck aims to out-tempo the opponent and finish the game with a strong board state. Collected Company provides additional card advantage and allows the deck to dig for key creatures efficiently. Thassa's Oracle serves as a potential win condition by manipulating the top of the deck."

The goal is to control the game through the use of counterspells and removal, while assembling the necessary pieces for the combo finish."
