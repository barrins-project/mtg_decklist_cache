Various cards like Pact of Negation and Spoils of the Vault are used to protect the combo and search for key pieces. The mana base is designed to support the combo while also providing card selection with Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand."

This mana is then used to cast powerful colorless spells like Karn Liberated, Karn, the Great Creator, and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to control the game and dominate the board. The deck also employs card selection and search effects like Ancient Stirrings, Sylvan Scrying, and Expedition Map to find key pieces and maintain consistency in its strategy. Additionally, the deck includes removal and graveyard hate cards to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
