The inclusion of Torrential Gearhulk allows for additional value from casting instants, giving the deck a strong late-game presence. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's control game plan."

By disrupting the opponent's game plan and keeping the battlefield under control, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent until it can close out the game with a series of high-impact spells and creatures. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements while ensuring consistency and the ability to access all necessary colors of mana."
