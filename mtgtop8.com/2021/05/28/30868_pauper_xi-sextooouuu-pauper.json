The inclusion of life gain spells like Morsel Theft and Sign in Blood helps to keep the player alive while they push for victory."

The inclusion of Thorn of the Black Rose allows for card advantage, while utility lands like Bojuka Bog and Witch's Cottage provide additional value. Overall, the deck combines aggression, disruption, and card advantage to secure victories."
