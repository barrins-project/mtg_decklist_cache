By removing threats, countering crucial spells, and drawing cards efficiently, the deck aims to control the pace of the game and grind out a victory over time. The inclusion of evasive creatures like Faerie Seer and Ninja of the Deep Hours helps secure card advantage and provide alternate win conditions. The deck also has a mix of removal spells like Agony Warp and Chainer's Edict to deal with various threats on the board."
