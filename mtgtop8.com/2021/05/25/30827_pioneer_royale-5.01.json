The deck focuses on ramping into big threats like Ghalta and using combat tricks like Aspect of Hydra and Primal Might to push through damage and control the board. By using efficient mana dorks like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic, the deck aims to curve out smoothly and apply pressure early in the game. The key strategy is to build a strong board presence and beat down the opponent before they can stabilize."

The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for recurring enchantments or creatures from the graveyard, ensuring a steady stream of threats. By consistently applying pressure and buffing up creatures with auras like All That Glitters and Ethereal Armor, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents and secure victory through efficient beatdown tactics."
