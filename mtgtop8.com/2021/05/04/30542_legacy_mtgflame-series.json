The deck aims to control the game by using disruptive spells like Force of Will and Force of Negation to protect its threats, and removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember to handle opposing threats. The mana base includes cards like Polluted Delta and Wasteland to support the deck's game plan."

The deck also focuses on card draw with cards like Glimpse of Nature and Elvish Visionary to help you find your combo pieces faster. With strong ramp and combo potential, this deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with a quick and powerful board presence."
