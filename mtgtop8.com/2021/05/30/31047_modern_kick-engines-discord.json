The goal is to use Ad Nauseam to draw the entire deck, then use Spoils of the Vault to put Thassa's Oracle on top of the library and win the game. Phyrexian Unlife is used to prevent death from life loss and Angel's Grace can buy extra turns if needed. The deck is focused on assembling the combo as quickly and consistently as possible to win the game."

It uses a combination of pump spells like Might of Old Krosa and Scale Up, alongside protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing, to ensure its creatures can deal lethal damage. The deck also includes cards like Spellskite and Spell Pierce for additional protection and disruption against opponents' removal spells. The goal is to assemble the right combination of cards to poison the opponent out before they can mount a defense."
