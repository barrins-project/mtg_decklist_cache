The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for the recycling of Auras and small creatures from the graveyard, ensuring a steady stream of threats. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures enhanced by Auras, while also maintaining protection and resilience through cards like Selfless Savior and Karametra's Blessing."
