The deck aims to quickly build up a strong board presence with creatures like Questing Beast and Lovestruck Beast, while also having ways to protect them with cards like Snakeskin Veil. The inclusion of snow lands allows for the activation of Faceless Haven for additional pressure on the opponent. Overall, the goal is to quickly and efficiently defeat the opponent using a Mono Green Aggro strategy."

It utilizes a mix of low-cost creatures like Whisper Squad, Eyetwitch, and Serrated Scorpion to maintain a steady board presence, while also utilizing higher-cost threats such as Woe Strider and Extus, Oriq Overlord for additional power. The deck aims to efficiently deal damage to the opponent while leveraging the sacrifice mechanic."

The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Professor Onyx and Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider, as well as efficient ramp spells like Cultivate and Emergent Ultimatum to help reach the late game where it can dominate with big threats like Elder Gargaroth and Valki, God of Lies. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion adds extra value and flexibility to the deck."
