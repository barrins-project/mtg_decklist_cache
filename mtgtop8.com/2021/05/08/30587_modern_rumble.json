            "notes": "The focus of this deck is to quickly build up a board presence with small, evasive creatures like Soul-Scar Mage, Monastery Swiftspear, Sprite Dragon, and Stormwing Entity. Utilizing efficient one-drop spells like Gut Shot and Mutagenic Growth to protect and pump these creatures gives the deck a tempo advantage. Card draw and selection spells like Opt, Manamorphose, Lava Dart, and Light Up the Stage help maintain momentum and find key pieces. Lightning Bolt provides additional removal and reach. The mana base is streamlined for consistency and speed."
