            "notes": "The deck focuses on playing powerful, low-cost creatures like Death's Shadow and Delver of Secrets to create fast pressure on the opponent. It also includes disruptive spells like Stubborn Denial and Thoughtseize to control the game and protect the creatures. The deck utilizes the graveyard with cards like Street Wraith and Gurmag Angler to fuel Death's Shadow and provide extra resources. The goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total while protecting your own creatures and disrupting their game plan."
