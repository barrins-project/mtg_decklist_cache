Teferi, Time Raveler helps control the board and prevents opponents from countering important spells. The deck also has removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile to deal with threats. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can win with a massive Scapeshift combo."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with discard spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, while also utilizing powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Wrenn and Six to control the board. By deploying threats like Tarmogoyf, Bloodbraid Elf, and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and close out the game quickly. This deck excels at grinding out victories through a combination of disruption and aggressive creatures."

The key strategy is to assemble UrzaTron (Urza's Mine, Tower, and Power Plant) to generate a large amount of mana to cast big threats like Ulamog and Wurmcoil Engine. The deck also includes control elements like Oblivion Stone and Karn, the Great Creator to deal with opposing threats. The deck aims to outvalue opponents with its efficient mana generation and powerful threats."
