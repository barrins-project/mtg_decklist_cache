Chalice of the Void is used to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Dismember and Walking Ballista provide removal options. The deck also includes utility lands like Eye of Ugin and Karakas, as well as disruptive cards like Wasteland to control the battlefield. Overall, the key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and efficient threats."
