The deck aims to stall the game and outvalue the opponent with card advantage from cards like Mulldrifter and Mnemonic Wall, while eventually closing out the game with big spells like Rolling Thunder. It aims to control the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful late-game threats."
