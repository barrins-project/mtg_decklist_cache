The deck focuses on using cheap counterspells like Spell Pierce and Counterspell, along with card draw spells like Behold the Multiverse and Frantic Inventory. Removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fiery Cannonade help keep the opponent's board in check, while creatures like Augur of Bolas and Sea Gate Oracle provide card advantage and board presence. The goal is to outvalue the opponent and control the game until a win condition can be established."
