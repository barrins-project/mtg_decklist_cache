            "notes": "The main goal of this deck is to quickly fill up your graveyard with cards like Buried Alive and Chain of Smog, allowing you to bring back powerful creatures like Arclight Phoenix. By using cards like Dark Ritual and Lotus Petal to generate fast mana, you can quickly cast spells to disrupt your opponent with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Duress. With a mix of card selection spells like Ponder and Brainstorm, as well as dual lands to ensure you have the right colors of mana, this deck aims to win the game with a fast and aggressive combo strategy."
