By ramping into these big threats early, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents before they have a chance to stabilize or respond effectively. The deck also includes a suite of countermagic and draw spells to protect its combo pieces and dig for crucial cards. It's all about cheating big creatures into play and closing out the game quickly."
