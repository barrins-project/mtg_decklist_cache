This combo is supported by cards like Arbor Elf, Utopia Sprawl, and Conclave Mentor to ramp up mana and maximize the effectiveness of the combo pieces. The deck also includes cards like Ranger-Captain of Eos and Collected Company to search for key combo pieces and disrupt opponent's strategies. The goal is to quickly assemble the combo and overwhelm the opponent with a massive life total and unstoppable creature."
