Stoneforge Mystic and equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice and Maul of the Skyclaves provide additional threats and value. Aether Vial allows for creatures to be played at instant speed, keeping the opponent guessing and allowing for unexpected interactions."

The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and maintain that pressure throughout, using cards like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear to attack repeatedly while keeping the opponent on their back foot with cards like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Searing Blaze to finish them off. The deck prioritizes speed and consistency in dealing damage to win the game quickly."
