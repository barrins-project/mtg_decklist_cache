It also includes control elements like counter spells and removal to protect its creatures and maintain board advantage. The inclusion of a companion, Obosh, the Preypiercer, alters the deck construction to maximize damage output. Overall, this aggressive strategy aims to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures and efficient spells, while maintaining versatility through its mana base and card choices."
