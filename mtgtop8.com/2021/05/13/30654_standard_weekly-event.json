            "notes": "This deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy while milling their deck for win conditions. By using cards like Thieves' Guild Enforcer, Ruin Crab, and Soaring Thought-Thief, the player can mill cards from the opponent's deck while controlling the game with counterspells like Mystical Dispute and Drown in the Loch. The key strategy is to outlast the opponent by steadily chipping away at their resources and deck, ultimately leading to victory through attrition and control of the board."
