The deck utilizes low-cost creatures with haste, burn spells, and disruptive cards like Blood Moon and Magus of the Moon to apply constant pressure. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion emphasizes the focus on dealing odd amounts of damage. With a heavy emphasis on aggression and tempo, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize or mount a defense."
