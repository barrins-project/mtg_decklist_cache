Creatures like Blighted Agent and Glistener Elf are used alongside pump spells like Might of Old Krosa and Scale Up to achieve this goal. The deck also includes protection spells like Spellskite and Blossoming Defense to keep the infect creatures safe. Inkmoth Nexus serves as an alternate win condition by turning into a creature with infect. The deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to respond."
