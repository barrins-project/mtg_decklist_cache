It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by stealing their creatures with Claim the Firstborn and sacrificing them for value with Woe Strider and Village Rites. The deck also utilizes cards like The Akroan War and Tymaret Calls the Dead to further disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, it focuses on dealing damage quickly while taking advantage of sacrificing and stealing mechanics."

By curving out with low-cost creatures like Bonecrusher Giant and Giant Killer, as well as generating card advantage with Edgewall Innkeeper, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly. Cards like Showdown of the Skalds help to refuel the hand and provide additional threats on the board. The mana base is well-balanced to ensure consistent access to all colors needed for the spells in the deck."

By constantly cycling cards, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a barrage of low-cost spells and creatures, while also maintaining card advantage and flexibility in play. The deck also includes cards like Drannith Stinger and Irencrag Pyromancer to deal direct damage to the opponent, making it a fast-paced aggro deck with a focus on cycling synergies."
