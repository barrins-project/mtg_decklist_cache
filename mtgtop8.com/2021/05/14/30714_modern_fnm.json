The deck also includes disruptive elements like Thoughtseize, Inquisition of Kozilek, and removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to control the board. The addition of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion provides additional value by allowing you to cast permanent cards from your graveyard. Using a combination of aggressive threats and disruption, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory."
