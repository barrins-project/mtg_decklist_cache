By utilizing cards like Selfless Savior and Alseid of Life's Bounty to protect key creatures, as well as impactful cards like Elite Spellbinder to disrupt the opponent's game plan, this deck aims to maintain pressure and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Overall, the strategy focuses on efficient aggression and resource management to secure victory."
