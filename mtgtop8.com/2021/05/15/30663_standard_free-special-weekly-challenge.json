By utilizing cards like Drown in the Loch, Cling to Dust, and Negate to control the opponent's plays, while also ramping up with Cultivate and mana fixing with the various pathways, the deck aims to stabilize the board until it can drop big threats like Koma, Cosmos Serpent and Elder Gargaroth to seal the victory. Yorion, Sky Nomad serves as an additional value engine and allows for extra card advantage with its blinking ability."

Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast-paced cycling strategy and finish them off with a powerful Zenith Flare."
