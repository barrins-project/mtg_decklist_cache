The deck also includes counterspells like Negate and Test of Talents to disrupt the opponent's strategies. Additionally, there are card advantage engines like Mazemind Tome and Omen of the Sea to maintain a steady flow of resources. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad suggests a focus on blinking and recurring value from enter-the-battlefield effects."

The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows the deck to generate even more value by flickering permanents on the battlefield. With versatile threats like Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider and Valki, God of Lies, this deck aims to dominate the late game with its powerful spells and creatures."
