The deck includes cards like Sigil of the Nayan Gods and Fire Whip to enhance the combo, as well as support cards like Soul Warden and Benevolent Bodyguard to protect and strengthen the combo pieces. It also includes cards like Journey to Nowhere and Standard Bearer for additional control and defense."

The deck also utilizes flicker effects to reuse powerful enters-the-battlefield abilities on creatures like Mulldrifter or Dinrova Horror. Overall, the deck focuses on resource management and out-valuing the opponent to secure victory."
