By utilizing powerful spirits like Supreme Phantom and Shacklegeist, the deck aims to control the board and chip away at the opponent's life total while protecting its own creatures with counter spells like Lofty Denial and Miscast. With the addition of Faceless Haven as a versatile mana sink, the deck is able to apply constant pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan, ultimately overwhelming them with a swarm of aggressive spirits."
