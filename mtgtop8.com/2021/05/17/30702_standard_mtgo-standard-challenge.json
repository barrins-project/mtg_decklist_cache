Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast serves as a powerful engine to cheat out big threats like Koma, Cosmos Serpent, creating overwhelming board states. The deck also includes cards like Brazen Borrower and Esika's Chariot for added versatility and tempo advantage."

It utilizes cards like Edgewall Innkeeper and Magda, Brazen Outlaw to generate card advantage and ramp into bigger threats. The deck also includes powerful equipment such as Embercleave to close out the game quickly. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy, allowing for consistent early plays and access to the deck's powerful top-end threats."
