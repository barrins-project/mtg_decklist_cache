By utilizing cards like Chainer's Edict, Cast Down, and Disfigure to remove threats from the board, the deck aims to establish a board presence with creatures like Guardian of the Guildpact and Palace Sentinels. The deck also includes lifegain cards like Pristine Talisman and Radiant Fountain to help stabilize against aggressive decks. The key strategy is to outvalue the opponent and slowly grind them out of the game."
