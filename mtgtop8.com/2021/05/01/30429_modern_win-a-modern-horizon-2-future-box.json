It includes strong low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, Eidolon of the Great Revel, and Goblin Guide, backed up by efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Boros Charm. The mana base is streamlined to support the aggressive gameplan with cards like Arid Mesa and Sunbaked Canyon. The overall strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent while also disrupting their game plan with burn spells and efficient creatures."
