The deck relies on creatures like Soul-Scar Mage, Ghitu Lavarunner, and Monastery Swiftspear to deal damage, while burn spells like Lightning Strike and Wizard's Lightning help finish off opponents. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, consistent damage output."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by using various counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to disrupt the opponent's strategy while building up a win condition with Shark Typhoon and Torrential Gearhulk. The deck also includes cards like Thoughtseize and Collective Brutality to further disrupt the opponent's hand and slow down their game plan. With a focus on controlling the board and out-valuing the opponent, this Dimir Control deck aims to grind out victories through attrition and resource management."
