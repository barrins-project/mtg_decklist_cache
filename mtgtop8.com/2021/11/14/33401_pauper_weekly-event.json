This is achieved by using cards like Field Surgeon, Blood Researcher, Stonybrook Schoolmaster, Soul's Attendant, Essence Warden, Jaspera Sentinel, Marauding Blight-Priest, Quirion Ranger, Saruli Caretaker, and Soul Warden. The deck also utilizes mana acceleration provided by Avacyn's Pilgrim and utilizes card draw and creature searching effects through Winding Way and Lead the Stampede."
