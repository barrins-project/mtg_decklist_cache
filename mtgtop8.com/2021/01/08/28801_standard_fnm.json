Utilizing cards like Call of the Death-Dweller and Lurrus of the Dream-Den to bring back key creatures from the graveyard for additional value and pressure. The deck also focuses on draining the opponent's life total with cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose. Overall, the strategy revolves around consistent creature aggression and disruption to quickly overwhelm the opponent."
