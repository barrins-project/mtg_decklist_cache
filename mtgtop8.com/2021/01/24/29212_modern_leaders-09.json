The deck utilizes Aether Vial for cheating creatures into play, along with powerful tribal support cards like Munitions Expert and Goblin Matron. The inclusion of Dark Confidant provides card advantage, while Sling-Gang Lieutenant offers an additional win condition. The mana base is optimized to support the aggressive game plan, allowing for quick and explosive plays to overwhelm the opponent."
