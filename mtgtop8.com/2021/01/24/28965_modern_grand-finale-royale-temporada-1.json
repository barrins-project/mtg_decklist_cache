By utilizing creatures like Thalia and Leonin Arbiter to slow down your opponent's mana development and cards like Skyclave Apparition and Flickerwisp to deal with threats, you can control the game while using Stoneforge Mystic to find powerful equipment to further enhance your creatures. The deck's synergy allows for a smooth curve of disruption and aggression, creating a challenging board state for your opponent to navigate."
