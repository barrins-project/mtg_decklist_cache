The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Atris, Oracle of Half-Truths and Elspeth's Nightmare. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for extra value by blinking permanents for additional ETB effects. The deck also includes win conditions in the form of Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Shark Typhoon."

With a strong card advantage engine in Mazemind Tome and Omen of the Sea, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent in the long game. By using powerful planeswalkers like Ashiok, Nightmare Muse and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, the deck can generate incremental advantage and eventually overpower the opponent. The companion Yorion, Sky Nomad provides additional value and recursion, allowing the deck to maintain control and grind out wins."
