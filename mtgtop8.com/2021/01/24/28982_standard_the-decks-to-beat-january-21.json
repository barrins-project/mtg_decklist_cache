The inclusion of removal spells like Fire Prophecy and The Akroan War helps to keep the opponent's board in check, while cards like Scavenging Ooze provide additional utility and resilience. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, resilient, and overwhelming in its aggression."

It also includes efficient removal options like Bonecrusher Giant and Brazen Borrower to control the board. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion allows for extra damage potential with odd-costed spells and abilities. The deck aims to control the game by out-valuing opponents with high-impact threats and efficient removal options."
