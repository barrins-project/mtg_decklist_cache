It aims to stabilize the game during the early turns with cards like Anger of the Gods and Mystical Dispute, then secure the late game with powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Shark Typhoon. The deck also benefits from ramp spells like Growth Spiral and Wilderness Reclamation to quickly develop its mana base and cast its more expensive spells. It ultimately aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through careful resource management and strategic decision-making."
