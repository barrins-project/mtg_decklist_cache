            "notes": "The deck focuses on establishing early control through counterspells and removal while generating card advantage with cards like Dreadhorde Arcanist and Narset, Parter of Veils. It also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Teferi, Time Raveler to further disrupt opponents' strategies. The deck can quickly ramp up its mana base with cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and can also disrupt opponents' resources with Hullbreacher. Overall, the deck aims to control the game tempo and outvalue opponents to secure victory."
