By utilizing a companion like Yorion, Sky Nomad, the deck gains an additional advantage by being able to flicker permanents for added value. The key concept is to outvalue and outlast the opponent by maintaining control of the game and grinding out a win."

            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the game by utilizing a combination of removal spells and disruptive creatures to keep the opponent on the back foot. By efficiently dealing with threats through cards like Heartless Act and Eliminate, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind them out of resources. Additionally, the inclusion of powerful finishers like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Ox of Agonas ensures that the deck has multiple avenues to close out the game once it has gained control."
