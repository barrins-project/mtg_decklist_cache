The deck focuses on generating card advantage with Dig Through Time and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, while efficiently dealing with threats using board wipes like Supreme Verdict and targeted removal spells like Seal Away. The win conditions include Shark Typhoon, Elspeth, Sun's Champion, and securing the game with the planeswalkers and the land base to ensure consistency and control over the opponent."
