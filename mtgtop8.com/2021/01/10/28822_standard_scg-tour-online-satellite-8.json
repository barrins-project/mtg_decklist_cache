By ramping up mana with cards like Cultivate and Lotus Cobra, the deck aims to cast huge threats like Terror of the Peaks and Elder Gargaroth. Genesis Ultimatum allows for explosive turns, while cards like Brazen Borrower provide flexibility. The deck also includes planeswalkers like Vivien and Ugin for added versatility. Overall, the goal is to control the board, generate card advantage, and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
