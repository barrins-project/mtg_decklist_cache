The deck also utilizes a companion, Yorion, Sky Nomad, which allows for extra deck manipulation and the ability to blink permanents for additional value. The deck also includes multiple enchantments like Doom Foretold and Elspeth Conquers Death, which further control the board and provide additional card advantage."

The key strategy is to maximize card draw and cycling effects to cycle through the deck quickly, while also utilizing creatures like Flourishing Fox and Valiant Rescuer to apply early pressure. Rielle, the Everwise serves as a powerful engine to draw more cards, while Frostveil Ambush can disrupt the opponent's plans. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient creatures and powerful direct damage spells."
