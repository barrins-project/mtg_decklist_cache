It aims to stall the game until it can generate enough value through Yorion's ability to exile and return permanents, while also utilizing Dance of the Manse to bring back powerful enchantments from the graveyard. The key idea is to outvalue the opponent by constantly recurring resources and disrupting their game plan with a combination of removal and enchantment-based threats."

The deck aims to continuously apply pressure with efficient creatures like Lovestruck Beast and Kazandu Mammoth, while also having a late-game plan with Kogla, the Titan Ape and Feasting Troll King. The Great Henge serves as a powerful engine that can quickly turn the tide of the game in your favor."
