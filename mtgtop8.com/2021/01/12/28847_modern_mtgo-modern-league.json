Stoneforge Mystic is used to tutor equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine for additional aggression. The deck also has a grindy aspect with cards like Lingering Souls and Liliana of the Veil. Overall, the strategy is to control the game early and transition into a strong midrange position to close out the game."

By utilizing cards like Cathartic Reunion, Shriekhorn, and Life from the Loam, the deck is able to dredge through its library, putting powerful creatures like Bloodghast, Narcomoeba, and Prized Amalgam directly onto the battlefield. The deck also incorporates cards like Creeping Chill and Conflagrate to deal damage to the opponent while benefiting from cards being put into the graveyard. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of threats from the graveyard."
