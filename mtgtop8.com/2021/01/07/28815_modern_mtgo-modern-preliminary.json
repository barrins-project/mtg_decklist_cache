The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion provides an additional boost to all odd-cost cards in the deck, increasing the potential for even faster damage output. Cards like Bonecrusher Giant and Lightning Bolt offer versatile removal options while cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage add to the aggression. Blood Moon can disrupt opponent's mana base, giving the deck a strategic advantage. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast and continuous damage, preventing them from stabilizing."

The goal is to lower the opponent's life total quickly and decisively, leveraging the power of cards like Thoughtseize to disrupt their game plan. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds additional value by allowing for recurring creatures and spells from the graveyard. The deck aims to apply relentless pressure and close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
