It aims to stall the opponent's game plan with cards like Path to Exile and Force of Negation while generating card advantage and incremental advantage with cards like Growth Spiral and Wrenn and Six. The deck's win condition revolves around powerful threats such as Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Omnath, Locus of Creation, backed up by extra turns from Time Warp to close out the game. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistency."

Using cards like Archive Trap and Surgical Extraction can further accelerate this process. The deck also includes control elements like Drown in the Loch and Fatal Push to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Visions of Beyond provides card draw, while Mesmeric Orb helps mill both players. The goal is to win the game by milling the opponent's entire library before they can win through traditional means."

By utilizing cards that boost Spirit creatures like Drogskol Captain and Supreme Phantom, as well as disruption cards like Spell Queller and Skyclave Apparition, the deck aims to control the board while dealing damage efficiently. Aether Vial helps to cheat creatures into play at instant speed, while lands like Moorland Haunt and Waterlogged Grove provide additional utility. Overall, the deck focuses on aggression and synergy within the Spirit tribal theme."
