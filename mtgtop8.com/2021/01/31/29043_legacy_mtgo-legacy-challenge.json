The deck also includes a variety of card draw and control spells to help find and protect the combo pieces.

The goal is to create a strong board presence and combo off for a lethal attack in just a few turns."

The deck also leverages mana acceleration from cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Chrome Mox to deploy threats ahead of schedule. Overall, the strategy revolves around punishing opponents for playing non-basic lands and overwhelming them with aggressive creatures."
