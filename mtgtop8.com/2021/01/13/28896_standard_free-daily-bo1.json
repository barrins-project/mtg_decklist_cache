Cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Embercleave enhance the power of creatures and allow for quick finishes. Anax, Hardened in the Forge provides resilience against removal, while cards like Bonecrusher Giant and Robber of the Rich offer flexibility in dealing damage. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a continuous stream of threats and finish the game before the opponent can stabilize."
