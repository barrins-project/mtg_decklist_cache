The deck aims to apply pressure early in the game through burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, while also maintaining card advantage and control through cantrips like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain. The inclusion of Wasteland allows for additional disruption, making it difficult for the opponent to develop their mana base."
