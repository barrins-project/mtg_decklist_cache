It utilizes a combination of rituals, mana rocks, and tutors to cast multiple cheap spells in a single turn, leading up to a lethal Tendrils of Agony finish. Veil of Summer and Defense Grid protect the player from disruption, while Burning Wish allows for flexible access to key combo pieces from the sideboard. The deck aims to be fast, efficient, and resilient against opposing interaction."
