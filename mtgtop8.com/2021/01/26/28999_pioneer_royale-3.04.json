The deck aims to control the board early with fast creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage, while also utilizing direct damage spells like Lightning Strike and Boros Charm to keep the pressure on. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional card advantage and resilience in the late game. By maintaining a fast pace and applying consistent pressure, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
