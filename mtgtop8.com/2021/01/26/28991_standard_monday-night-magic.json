The goal is to quickly build a threatening board presence and push for early and consistent damage. Key cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Anax, Hardened in the Forge boost the power of your creatures, while Embercleave and Shatterskull Smashing provide additional burst damage. With a mix of hasty creatures and powerful combat tricks, this deck aims to close out games swiftly before the opponent can stabilize."
