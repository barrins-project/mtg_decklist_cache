It utilizes cards like Force of Will and Force of Negation to counter important spells, while also having access to powerful planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns. The deck also incorporates a snow mana base and cards like Astrolabe for additional card draw and fixing. Dreadhorde Arcanist provides value by recasting powerful spells, while Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides card advantage and a threat to close out the game."
