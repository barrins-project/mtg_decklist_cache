Overall, this deck aims to control the pace of the game while applying pressure to your opponent."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to use aggressive human creatures with powerful abilities to quickly overwhelm the opponent. By utilizing cards like Champion of the Parish, Thalia's Lieutenant, and Mantis Rider, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Cards like Meddling Mage and Reflector Mage help control the opponent's plays, while Aether Vial and Ancient Ziggurat provide mana acceleration and flexibility in casting creatures. The deck also benefits from the tribal synergy of having mostly human creatures, supported by tribal lands like Cavern of Souls and Unclaimed Territory."
