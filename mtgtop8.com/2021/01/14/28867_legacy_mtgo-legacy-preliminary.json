The deck also utilizes efficient card draw with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Sylvan Library, along with value creatures like Dreadhorde Arcanist and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. The inclusion of Astrolabe and Ice-Fang Coatl not only provide fixings for the mana base but also offer card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to out-value and out-control their opponent while staying ahead on resources."
