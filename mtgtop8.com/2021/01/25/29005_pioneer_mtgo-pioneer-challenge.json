Wilderness Reclamation enables the player to cast multiple spells in a turn, providing more flexibility and control over the game. The deck also includes cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Censor to restrict opponent's card drawing abilities. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements while providing consistent access to the necessary colors."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing a graveyard strategy to quickly assemble a powerful board presence and potentially win the game in one explosive turn. By sacrificing creatures and utilizing graveyard recursion effects, the deck can quickly cycle through its deck to find key combo pieces, such as Balustrade Spy and Undercity Informer, to mill cards and trigger powerful win conditions like Thassa's Oracle or Creeping Chill. The deck aims to win through a combination of self-mill, graveyard recursion, and explosive combo plays without relying on traditional land-based strategies."
