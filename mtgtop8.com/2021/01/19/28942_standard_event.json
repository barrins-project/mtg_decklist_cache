By playing a combination of disruptive spells like Negate and Essence Scatter, removal spells like Heartless Act and Eliminate, and card draw engines like Mazemind Tome, the deck aims to keep the opponent's threats in check while maintaining card advantage. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by flickering permanents for extra triggers."
