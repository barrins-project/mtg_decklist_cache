Additionally, Karn, the Great Creator provides utility and disruption against artifact-heavy decks. With a solid mana base and consistent ramp, this deck looks to push the tempo and outpace opponents in the early game."

By utilizing cards like All That Glitters, Ethereal Armor, and Gryff's Boon, the deck aims to boost their creatures' power and toughness while also providing other beneficial effects. Additionally, the inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for the possibility of recurring key Auras or creatures from the graveyard to maintain pressure on the opponent. The deck's mana base supports its aggressive strategy by providing a consistent source of colored mana."
