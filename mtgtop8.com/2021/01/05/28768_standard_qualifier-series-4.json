The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Bloodchief's Thirst, Heartless Act, and Mystical Dispute, while also generating card advantage with Titans' Nest and Shark Typhoon. By efficiently removing threats and countering key spells, the deck can slow down the game and then win with powerful planeswalkers like Garruk, Cursed Huntsman and Ashiok, Nightmare Muse. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency and stability in casting spells."
