            "notes": "This deck focuses on gaining control of the board through a combination of removal spells and sacrificing your own creatures for value. By utilizing cards like Rankle, Master of Pranks and Woe Strider, you can disrupt your opponent's game plan while constantly generating card advantage. The deck also has a recursive strategy with cards like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Tymaret Calls the Dead to constantly pressure your opponent. With a mix of creatures, removal, and card draw, you aim to outvalue and outlast your opponent in a grindy game."

The deck utilizes a variety of control elements such as removal spells like Skyclave Apparition and Extinction Event, along with card draw and disruption tools like Mazemind Tome and Doom Foretold. The goal is to control the board through removal and disruption while generating card advantage and value through Yorion's ability to blink multiple permanents at once. Ultimately, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent in a late-game grind."

The inclusion of removal spells like Shatterskull Smashing and The Akroan War helps to clear the way for attacks, while Vivien, Monsters' Advocate offers a strong source of card advantage and creature generation."
