The deck focuses on dealing damage as quickly as possible, with cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Bonecrusher Giant leading the charge. By using direct damage spells like Lightning Strike and Wild Slash, the deck aims to finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. The inclusion of card draw spells like Light Up the Stage and Valakut Awakening helps to maintain momentum and burn through the opponent's defenses."
