Aether Vial helps to cheat creatures into play at instant speed, while cards like Collected Company provide additional creature value. Drogskol Captain enhances the team's abilities and Cavern of Souls ensures our creatures can't be countered. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and disruptive creature strategy."

It utilizes efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to control the board while disrupting the opponent's hand with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value to be gained from recurring small creatures and spells from the graveyard. Overall, the deck seeks to deal damage quickly and efficiently while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
