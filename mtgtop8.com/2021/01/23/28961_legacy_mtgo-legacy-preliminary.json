The deck relies on powerful artifact mana ramp with cards like Karn, the Great Creator, Urza, Lord High Artificer, and Chalice of the Void to control the game and protect the combo pieces. The inclusion of Gyruda, Doom of Depths as a companion provides additional value and options for the deck. The synergy between the combo pieces and efficient mana production is key to the deck's success."
