By revealing Thassa's Oracle with no cards left in the deck, the player can win the game instantly. The deck includes cards to help generate mana quickly, protect the combo with Pact of Negation, and disrupt opponents with cards like Thoughtseize and Cabal Therapy. The goal is to achieve a fast and efficient win through a high-risk, high-reward combo."
