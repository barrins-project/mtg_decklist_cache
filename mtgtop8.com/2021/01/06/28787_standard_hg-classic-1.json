Utilizing cards like Doom Foretold, Elspeth Conquers Death, and Treacherous Blessing, the deck aims to control the tempo of the game while generating value from enchantments and card advantage. With Yorion, Sky Nomad as the companion, the deck can reset the battlefield and gain additional value from enters-the-battlefield triggers. The inclusion of a small number of win condition cards like Dance of the Manse and Emeria's Call allows the deck to close out games once the opponent's resources are depleted."
