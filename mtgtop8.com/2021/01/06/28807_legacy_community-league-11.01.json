It also disrupts the opponent's hand using cards like Cabal Therapy and Duress, while also reducing their resources with cards like Collective Brutality. The deck can quickly assemble the combo of Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage to create a powerful 20/20 indestructible creature. Overall, the strategy revolves around fast graveyard interactions and powerful combo plays to overwhelm the opponent."
