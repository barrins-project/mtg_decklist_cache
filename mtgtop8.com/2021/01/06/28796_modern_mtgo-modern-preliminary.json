The mana base is designed to support the deck's blue, black, and green spells, while also utilizing lands like Mystic Sanctuary and Field of the Dead to further control the game and generate advantage. The deck aims to control the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful threats and card advantage engines."
