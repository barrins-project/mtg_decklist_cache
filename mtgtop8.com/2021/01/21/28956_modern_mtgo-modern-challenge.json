The inclusion of cards like Drogskol Captain and Supreme Phantom help increase the power of Spirits on the battlefield, while cards like Spell Queller and Skyclave Apparition provide additional disruption and removal options. Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, while cards like Remorseful Cleric and Selfless Spirit offer utility and protection for the deck's game plan."

By utilizing cards like Mishra's Bauble and Chromatic Star to fill the graveyard, the deck can generate a large amount of mana with Mox Amber and Pentad Prism, allowing for the activation of Grinding Station multiple times. This combo aims to mill the opponent's entire library, ultimately winning the game with Thassa's Oracle or dealing massive damage with Sai, Master Thopterist. It also incorporates disruptive elements with Teferi, Time Raveler and Metallic Rebuke to control the game state."
