            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game through countering, removal, and card advantage, while also generating incremental value with cards like Uro and Wilderness Reclamation. By using cards like Censor, Mystical Dispute, and Negate to disrupt opponents' plans, along with removal like Radiant Flames and Blast Zone, the deck aims to slow down opponents and eventually overwhelm them with powerful threats like Shark Typhoon and Expansion / Explosion. The land base is optimized for consistency and flexibility, allowing for a variety of spells to be cast efficiently."
