By combining cards like Chalice of the Void, Karn, the Great Creator, and Hullbreacher with card-drawing engines like Narset, Parter of Veils and Emry, Lurker of the Loch, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent and control the game. The inclusion of cards like Mox Opal and Lotus Petal also allows for explosive starts and efficient mana production. Ultimately, this deck aims to establish board control and pressure the opponent early on."

The deck also aims to disrupt opponent's strategies with cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Chalice of the Void. Oko, Thief of Crowns provides additional versatility and disruption, while Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath can provide additional value and life gain. Overall, the deck seeks to control the battlefield and pressure opponents with a combination of artifacts and powerful planeswalkers."
