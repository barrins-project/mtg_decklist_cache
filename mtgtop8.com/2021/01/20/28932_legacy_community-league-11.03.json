            "notes": "The main concept of this Dark Depths combo deck is to quickly assemble the Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage combo to create a 20/20 Marit Lage token. The deck focuses on utilizing cards like Crop Rotation, Sylvan Scrying, and Elvish Reclaimer to tutor for the necessary combo pieces, while also including disruption in the form of Duress, Thoughtseize, and Inquisition of Kozilek to protect the combo. Cards like Lotus Petal and Gemstone Mine help to accelerate mana production, while Not of This World and Pithing Needle provide additional protection and disruption against opposing strategies."
