The deck aims to stall the game and outvalue the opponent with efficient creatures like Archon of Sun's Grace and Archon of Absolution. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by flickering permanents for extra triggers and effects. Overall, the Mono White Control deck focuses on outlasting opponents through strategic decision-making and resource management."
