The deck focuses on utilizing cheap and efficient creatures along with combat tricks to go wide and go tall at the same time, creating a powerful board presence early in the game. The inclusion of Heliod, Sun-Crowned and Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional synergy and utility, while cards like Speaker of the Heavens and Maul of the Skyclaves offer ways to close out the game quickly."
