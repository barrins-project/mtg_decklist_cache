The goal is to play efficient creatures like Bonecrusher Giant and Lovestruck Beast, while ramping up with Kazandu Mammoth and utilizing Embercleave for huge swings in damage. The Great Henge provides additional card draw and benefits from your large creatures, while Shatterskull Smashing can clear the way for your attacks. With a mix of removal and potent threats, this deck aims to put pressure on your opponent early and close out the game before they can stabilize."
