By utilizing cards such as Brazen Borrower, Bonecrusher Giant, and Terror of the Peaks, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while building up its own board presence. Additionally, cards like The Great Henge and Genesis Ultimatum provide card advantage and ramp potential, allowing the player to out-value their opponent in the late game. Overall, the deck's goal is to maintain control of the battlefield and ultimately overpower the opponent with its powerful creatures and spells."

Additionally, using cards like Heliod, Sun-Crowned and Maul of the Skyclaves can help provide extra damage and boost the creatures' effectiveness.
