            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly dealing damage to the opponent through aggressive creatures and burn spells. By using cards like Goblin Guide, Monastery Swiftspear, and Eidolon of the Great Revel to attack the opponent directly, as well as spells like Chain Lightning, Lava Spike, and Lightning Bolt to finish them off, the deck aims to win before the opponent can stabilize. Price of Progress also punishes opponents for playing non-basic lands, while Roiling Vortex disrupts their card draw and life gain strategies. Fireblast and Exquisite Firecraft provide additional reach to close out games efficiently."

The combination of burn spells like Lightning Bolt and efficient card draw/filtering spells like Brainstorm and Ponder ensures consistency and adaptability in a variety of matchups. The mana base is streamlined to support the aggressive strategy and includes Wasteland for additional disruption."
