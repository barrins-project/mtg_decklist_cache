The deck includes cards that allow you to search for key pieces, protect your combo, and generate mana to execute the combo efficiently. By efficiently ramping into your combo pieces and using cards like Collected Company to find them, you can quickly assemble the combo and win the game before your opponent can respond. The deck focuses on creating a powerful synergy between its cards to achieve a decisive victory."

Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by allowing you to recast cheap creatures and spells from your graveyard. The deck aims to apply consistent pressure and close out the game as quickly as possible with a combination of aggressive creatures and burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Temur Battle Rage."
