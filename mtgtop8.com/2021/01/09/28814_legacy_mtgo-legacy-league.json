It also includes disruption elements like Force of Will and Hullbreacher to protect the combo. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with massive creatures and quickly win the game before they have a chance to respond. Additionally, cards like Brainstorm and Ponder help to set up the combo pieces and ensure smooth draws. The mana base is optimized for fast and consistent ramping into the combo."
