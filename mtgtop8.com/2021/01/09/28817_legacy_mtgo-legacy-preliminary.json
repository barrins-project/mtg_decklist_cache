Utilizing cards like Altar of Dementia and Bridge from Below, the deck aims to mill through the library and generate a large army of creatures to overwhelm the opponent. Cabal Therapy is used to disrupt the opponent's strategy while Carrion Feeder provides a sacrifice outlet. This deck is fast-paced and focuses on explosive plays to win the game quickly."
