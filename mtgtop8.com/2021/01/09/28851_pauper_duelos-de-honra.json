            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly burning through the opponent's life total with a combination of direct damage spells and creatures that deal damage when tapping. By constantly discarding cards and drawing new ones, it ensures a steady stream of burn spells to keep the pressure on. The key strategy is to apply pressure early and force the opponent to react while maintaining card advantage through efficient spellcasting. The deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize and turn the tide in their favor."
