The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, manage threats, and outvalue the opponent with cards like Ugin, Ashiok, and Mazemind Tome. It utilizes a mix of control elements, including sweepers like Shadows' Verdict and Extinction Event, versatile threats like Shark Typhoon, and land-based win conditions like Crawling Barrens. The deck aims to grind out the opponent and win in the late game through attrition and card advantage."
