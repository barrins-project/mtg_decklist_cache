            "notes": "The main idea of this mono green aggro deck is to quickly fill the board with mana dorks, then ramp into big creatures like Ulamog's Crusher and overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of powerful creatures. The deck also focuses on card advantage through Lead the Stampede and Winding Way to ensure a steady stream of threats. With a mix of ramp, card draw, and high-impact creatures, this deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
