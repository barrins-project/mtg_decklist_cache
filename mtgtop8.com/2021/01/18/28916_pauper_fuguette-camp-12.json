The deck's key strategy revolves around playing impactful creatures like Gurmag Angler and Gray Merchant of Asphodel to quickly reduce the opponent's life total, while also using cards like Chainer's Edict and Defile to remove any threats the opponent may have on the board. The inclusion of card draw spells like Sign in Blood helps to maintain card advantage and keep the pressure on the opponent."
