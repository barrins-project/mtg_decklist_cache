The key strategy is to establish a strong board presence early on with low-cost creatures like Fervent Champion and Fireblade Charger, then use powerful cards like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell to deal massive damage and close out the game quickly. The deck also includes removal spells like Bonecrusher Giant and Shocks to deal with opposing threats and keep the pressure on."
