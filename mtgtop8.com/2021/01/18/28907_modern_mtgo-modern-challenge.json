The deck includes various mana accelerators like Lotus Bloom and Pentad Prism to enable casting the combo spells quickly.

The deck also includes disruption spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize to control the opponent's hand, paired with removal like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to eliminate threats. Mishra's Bauble provides card advantage and synergizes with Lurrus of the Dream-Den, who can be used as a valuable companion. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and disrupt the opponent's game plan to secure a victory."
