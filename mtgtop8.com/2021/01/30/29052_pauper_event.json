The deck includes cards that generate mana, such as Llanowar Elves and Priest of Titania, to play out multiple creatures in a single turn. Cards like Timberwatch Elf and Wirewood Pride provide pump effects to make the Elves more threatening. Lead the Stampede and Distant Melody help draw into more creatures to keep up the pressure. The goal is to swarm the opponent with Elves and win the game before they can stabilize."
