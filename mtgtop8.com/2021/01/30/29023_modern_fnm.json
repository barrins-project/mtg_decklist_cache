By using cards like Daybreak Coronet, Ethereal Armor, and Rancor, the deck aims to create a fast clock and outpace the opponent before they can establish their own game plan. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional card advantage and recursion, making the deck more resilient in longer games. The goal is to go all in on a single threat and race to victory before the opponent can find an answer."

The deck also includes spells like Burst Lightning, Gut Shot, Mutagenic Growth, and Lightning Bolt to control the board and push for damage. Card draw is provided by Opt, Lava Dart, Manamorphose, and Light Up the Stage. The mana base consists of a mix of fetch lands and fast lands to ensure consistency in casting spells."
