The key is to use cards like Balustrade Spy and Undercity Informer to fill your graveyard with creatures and then use Dread Return to bring back Thassa's Oracle for the win. The deck also includes disruption spells like Cabal Therapy and Pact of Negation to protect your combo."

The deck also utilizes powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf, Kroxa, and Bloodbraid Elf to quickly bring down the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Hymn to Tourach and Liliana of the Veil provide further disruption and card advantage. The land base includes a mix of fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistent mana."

The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board control throughout the game."
