It also utilizes efficient removal and disruption spells to control the opponent's board while applying pressure with aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Bomat Courier. Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by allowing the player to replay their small creatures and Mishra's Bauble. The deck aims to win the game through a combination of burst damage and disruption, punishing opponents who are unable to keep up with its fast pace."
