Supporting spells like Collective Defiance, Lightning Strike, and Wild Slash help to quickly deal damage and maintain board control. Card draw and additional burn spells are provided by Light Up the Stage and Wizard's Lightning. The land base consists of mostly Mountains with some Ramunap Ruins for added reach. This deck aims to close out games swiftly and decisively with a relentless onslaught of damage."
