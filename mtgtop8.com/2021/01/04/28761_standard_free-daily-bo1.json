By using cards like Ruin Crab and Soaring Thought-Thief to mill the opponent's library, and Thieves' Guild Enforcer to pressure their hand size, the deck aims to control the game until it can play powerful finishers like Drown in the Loch and Into the Story. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion offers additional value by allowing the deck to recur key threats and disruptions."
