It aims to control the board with removal and disruption while using efficient creatures like Stoneforge Mystic and Flickerwisp to apply pressure. The deck utilizes Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play and gain tempo advantage. The inclusion of equipment cards like Sword of Fire and Ice, Batterskull, and Umezawa's Jitte enhances the deck's combat capabilities and provides additional ways to close out games. The mana base is optimized for disruption with Wasteland and Rishadan Port while also providing utility with Karakas and Sunbaked Canyon."

It also utilizes tempo plays with cards like Daze and Stifle to keep the opponent off balance.

Wasteland is included to disrupt the opponent's mana base, while Brazen Borrower and Hullbreacher offer additional disruption options. The deck aims to win quickly and efficiently through a mix of aggression and disruption."
