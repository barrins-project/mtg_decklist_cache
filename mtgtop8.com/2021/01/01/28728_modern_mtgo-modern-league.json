The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion allows for even more damage potential. The deck also runs disruptive cards like Blood Moon to disrupt the opponent's mana base. The goal is to apply constant pressure and finish the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The mana base is streamlined for consistency and to ensure that the deck can consistently deploy threats on curve."
