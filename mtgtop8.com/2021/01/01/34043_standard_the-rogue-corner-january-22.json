It achieves this by using a combination of removal spells (such as Infernal Grasp and Valorous Stance) to deal with threats, while also providing card advantage and life gain through cards like Prosperous Innkeeper and Righteous Valkyrie. Additionally, the deck aims to generate tokens and create a wide board state with cards like Starnheim Unleashed and Esika's Chariot. Overall, the key strategy is to control the game's tempo and eventually overwhelm the opponent with a combination of removal, life gain, and token generation."
