By cycling through the deck, the player can draw more cards, make use of cards like Zenith Flare to deal damage based on the number of cards in hand, and build up creatures like Flourishing Fox and Valiant Rescuer. The deck focuses on aggression and efficiency, using cheap cycling cards and creatures with cycling abilities to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently."
