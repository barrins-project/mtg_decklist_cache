It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and outvalue them in the long game, using cards like Mazemind Tome and Shark Typhoon to maintain card advantage and eventually close out the game. The deck has a mix of permission spells, removal, and threats to help control the board and dictate the pace of the game. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and provide flexibility in casting spells."
