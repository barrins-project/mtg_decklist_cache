With a mix of evasive threats like Bone Picker and removal spells like Defile and Cast Down, the deck aims to chip away at the opponent's life total while disrupting their game plan. The inclusion of cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Thorn of the Black Rose provide additional value and staying power in the late game. The deck also features utility lands like Witch's Cottage and Bojuka Bog to further disrupt the opponent's strategies."
