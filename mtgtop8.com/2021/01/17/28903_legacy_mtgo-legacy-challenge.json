Cabal Therapy is used for disruption, while Altar of Dementia and Bridge from Below provide additional win conditions. Stitcher's Supplier, Satyr Wayfinder, and Hedron Crab help mill the deck for more creature recursion. The mana base includes fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistent mana production. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and resilient graveyard-based combo strategy."
