By combining cards that provide card draw and mana fixing with efficient threats like Atog, Carapace Forger, and Myr Enforcer, the deck aims to apply pressure early and finish off the opponent with powerful cards like Fling and Galvanic Blast. The deck utilizes the affinity mechanic to reduce the cost of its threats and maximize its board presence, creating a fast and explosive game plan."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly deploying low-cost artifact creatures and using cards like Thoughtcast and Prophetic Prism to draw into more resources. Atogs and other artifact creatures are powered up by sacrificing artifacts, leading to explosive damage potential. The deck also includes removal spells like Galvanic Blast and Electrickery, as well as finishing cards like Fling and Temur Battle Rage to close out games quickly. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of cheap, powerful creatures while maintaining card advantage through efficient draw spells."
