This strategy focuses on aggressive attacks and maintaining a strong offense with a mix of creatures like Lagonna-Band Trailblazer and Akroan Skyguard, while protecting them with a variety of enchantments and combat tricks such as Ethereal Armor and Mutagenic Growth. The goal is to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain a steady stream of threats throughout the game."
