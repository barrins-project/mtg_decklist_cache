Additionally, the deck aims to utilize creatures with high power and toughness like Annoyed Altisaur and Crimson Fleet Commodore to apply pressure on the opponent and close out the game quickly. The inclusion of cards like Bonder's Ornament and Llanowar Visionary provide card advantage and help ensure a steady stream of threats."
