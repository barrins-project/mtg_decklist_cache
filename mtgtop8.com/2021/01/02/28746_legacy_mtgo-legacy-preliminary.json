The deck is designed to efficiently dig through its library with cantrips like Ponder, Preordain, and Brainstorm, while also disrupting opponents with cards like Duress and Force of Will. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the combo and protect against opposing strategies. The deck aims to quickly execute its combo and win the game before opponents can establish their game plan."
