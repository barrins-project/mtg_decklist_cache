It also includes cards that provide protection and evasion for the creatures, ensuring they can continue to deal damage efficiently. The goal is to maintain a constant stream of aggressive threats to pressure the opponent and secure a quick victory through early aggression. Additionally, the deck includes a few control elements to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain board advantage."
