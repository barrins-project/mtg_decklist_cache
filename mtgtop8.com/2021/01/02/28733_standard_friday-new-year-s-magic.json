The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays while also gaining card advantage through Trail of Crumbs and The Great Henge. Ugin, the Spirit Dragon provides a powerful late-game threat, and cards like Witch's Oven and Crawling Barrens offer additional utility and resilience. The deck's strategy centers around establishing a strong board presence and leveraging its powerful creatures to quickly finish off opponents."
