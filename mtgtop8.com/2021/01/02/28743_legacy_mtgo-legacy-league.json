The key strategy is to efficiently cycle through the deck with a focus on speed and consistency, while protecting the combo with Pact of Negation and Leyline of Anticipation. The deck relies on careful sequencing and resource management to execute the combo successfully and overwhelm the opponent before they can react."

The deck aims to quickly close out the game using burn spells like Chain Lightning and Lightning Bolt. The inclusion of card draw spells like Ponder and Brainstorm allows for consistent card selection and keeps the pressure on the opponent. The mana base is built to support a fast and consistent early-game aggression."
