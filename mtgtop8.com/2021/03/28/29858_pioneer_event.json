With a mix of powerful creatures like Knight of the Ebon Legion and Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet, along with disruptive spells like Fatal Push and Thoughseize, the deck aims to control the game early on and maintain that advantage. The inclusion of lifelink creatures like Gifted Aetherborn and Champion of Dusk helps to offset any life loss from aggressive plays. Overall, the deck is designed to be fast, efficient, and relentless in its attack strategy."

Selfless Savior and Alseid of Life's Bounty provide protection for your key threats, while Lurrus of the Dream-Den acts as an additional resource to retrieve auras from the graveyard."
