By utilizing cards like Ornithopter and Frogmite, along with mana acceleration from cards like Springleaf Drum, the deck aims to quickly put pressure on the opponent. Disciple of the Vault and Atog provide additional damage potential, while Cranial Plating boosts the power of your creatures. Galvanic Blast and Fling offer direct damage to finish off the opponent. Thoughtcast provides card advantage to maintain pressure and keep the aggression going."
