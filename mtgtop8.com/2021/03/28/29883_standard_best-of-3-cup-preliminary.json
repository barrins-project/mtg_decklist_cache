The deck focuses on disruption through counterspells and removal, while utilizing cards like Ruin Crab and Soaring Thought-Thief to mill the opponent's deck. Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a companion to provide additional value by recycling small creatures from the graveyard. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent and win the game through attrition."

By including cards that provide card advantage, removal spells, and powerful finishers like Emergent Ultimatum, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and ultimately establish dominance in the late game. The inclusion of both Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion and various modal lands allows for flexibility in gameplay and ensures consistency in drawing the necessary resources to control the game. With a mix of ramp, removal, and powerful threats, this Sultai Control deck is well-equipped to handle a variety of opposing strategies."
