            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to flood the board with low-cost, efficient creatures (aggro) and overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats. The deck focuses on using Weenie White creatures to quickly establish a strong board presence and apply pressure early in the game. By combining powerful cards like Skyclave Apparition and Luminarch Aspirant with equipment like Shadowspear and Maul of the Skyclaves, the deck aims to control the board and outpace the opponent with aggressive, evasive creatures. It also utilizes protection and removal spells to keep its creatures safe and clear the way for attacks."
