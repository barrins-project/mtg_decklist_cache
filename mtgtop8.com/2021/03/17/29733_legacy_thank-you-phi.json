The deck includes cards like Crop Rotation and Elvish Reclaimer to search for the combo pieces, as well as disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to protect the combo. It also has cards like Abrupt Decay and Wasteland to deal with opposing threats. The key strategy is to quickly assemble the combo while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
