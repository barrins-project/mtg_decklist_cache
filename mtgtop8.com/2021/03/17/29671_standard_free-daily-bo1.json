The deck aims to take control of the board early on and maintain pressure with efficient creatures like Torbran and Anax. The deck also includes powerful equipment like Embercleave to further enhance its creatures and push for lethal damage. With a low curve and a focus on dealing damage efficiently, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and close out the game quickly."
