The deck focuses on playing multiple small creatures quickly, supported by equipment such as Maul of the Skyclaves to boost their power and provide evasion. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Selfless Savior and Alseid of Life's Bounty to protect key creatures from removal spells, allowing them to maintain a constant pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Reidane, God of the Worthy also helps the deck disrupt the opponent's game plan and slow them down."
