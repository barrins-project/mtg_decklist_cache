By utilizing lands that tap for multiple mana and bounce lands to generate additional land drops, the deck can ramp into powerful threats quickly. The inclusion of utility lands like Cavern of Souls and Ghost Quarter adds flexibility and disruption to the deck's game plan. The combination of ramp, land synergy, and powerful threats makes the deck a potent combo archetype with the potential to overwhelm opponents quickly."
