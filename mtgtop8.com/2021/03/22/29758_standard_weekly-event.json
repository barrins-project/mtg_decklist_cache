The key strategy involves applying pressure early with efficient creatures like Fervent Champion and Robber of the Rich, while also gaining advantage with cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell. By combining these aggressive threats with burn spells like Frost Bite and Embercleave, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can stabilize. The addition of Snow-Covered Mountain and Faceless Haven provide additional flexibility and evasion options for closing out games."
