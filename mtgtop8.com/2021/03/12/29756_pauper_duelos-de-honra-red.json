The deck also utilizes card draw and mana fixing artifacts to help dig for key pieces and ensure a steady stream of resources. Control elements like Hydroblast and Fiery Cannonade help maintain board control while cards like Weather the Storm provide lifegain and resilience against aggressive strategies. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its mana advantage and high-impact threats."
