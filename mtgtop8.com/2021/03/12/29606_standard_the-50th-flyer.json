By utilizing Winota's ability to put more creatures into play, the deck aims to create a strong offensive position and defeat the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. This deck includes a mix of creatures and equipment to provide both aggression and versatility in combat, while also incorporating some protection and removal spells to help maintain control of the battlefield."
