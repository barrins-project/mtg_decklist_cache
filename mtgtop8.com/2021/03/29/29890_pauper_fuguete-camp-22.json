With cards like Priest of Titania and Birchlore Rangers, it aims to generate lots of mana to cast powerful elf creatures like Timberwatch Elf and Elvish Vanguard. Cards like Distant Melody and Lead the Stampede help to refuel your hand with more elves, ensuring a steady stream of threats to pressure the opponent. The goal is to quickly build a strong board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
