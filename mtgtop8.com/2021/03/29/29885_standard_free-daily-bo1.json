The inclusion of Obosh as a companion provides a unique twist to the deck's strategy, amplifying the damage output of each odd-costed creature. With a mix of powerful threats like Goldspan Dragon and Koma, Cosmos Serpent, alongside versatile removal spells and card draw engines like Edgewall Innkeeper and The Great Henge, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory."
