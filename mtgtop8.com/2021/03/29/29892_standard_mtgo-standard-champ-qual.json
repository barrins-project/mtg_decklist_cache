Torbran, Thane of Red Fell increases the damage output of all red sources, while Faceless Haven can turn into a creature for added pressure. Frost Bite and Shatterskull Smashing offer additional removal and reach. The goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can stabilize."
