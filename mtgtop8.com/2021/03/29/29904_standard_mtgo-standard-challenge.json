By playing efficient and powerful creatures like Bonecrusher Giant, Brushfire Elemental, and Questing Beast, combined with impactful spells like Shatterskull Smashing and Embercleave, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Edgewall Innkeeper and Goldspan Dragon helps provide card advantage and additional options for closing out games. Overall, the deck's goal is to apply pressure early and maintain tempo to secure victory in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."

The deck also includes some resilient threats like Phoenix of Ash and Faceless Haven.

By utilizing powerful red creatures like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, along with powerful equipment like Embercleave, the deck aims to close out games quickly by dealing huge bursts of damage. The inclusion of snow lands allows for additional removal with Frost Bite, while Faceless Haven provides a threat that can be activated at will. Overall, this deck is designed to put pressure on the opponent and win the game as fast as possible."
