Cards like Lovestruck Beast, Questing Beast, and Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider provide both aggression and disruption, while cards like The Great Henge and Garruk, Unleashed offer additional value and card advantage. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive creatures and pump spells like Blizzard Brawl and Snakeskin Veil to protect them, ultimately leading to a quick victory."
