By utilizing cards like Ethereal Armor and Cartouche of Solidarity, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with small but powerful creatures while also protecting them with spells like Karametra's Blessing and Emerge Unscathed. The goal is to quickly deploy a threat that can quickly close out the game before the opponent has a chance to mount a defense."
