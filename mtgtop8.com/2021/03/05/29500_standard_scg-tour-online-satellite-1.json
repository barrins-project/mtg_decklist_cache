The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value through blinking permanents like Omen of the Sea and Esika's Chariot. The deck also utilizes the versatility of Valki, God of Lies and the ramp potential of Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider to further disrupt the opponent's game plan.

By playing cards like Brazen Borrower, Bonecrusher Giant, and Lovestruck Beast, the deck aims to maintain board presence and deal damage efficiently. Goldspan Dragon and The Great Henge provide additional value and card advantage, while Obosh, the Preypiercer serves as a powerful companion to enhance the deck's damage output. With a mix of counterspells and card draw options, the deck aims to be aggressive while maintaining some control elements to stay ahead in the game."
