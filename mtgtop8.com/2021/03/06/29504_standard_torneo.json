By efficiently cycling cards and utilizing support cards like Improbable Alliance and Irencrag Pyromancer, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of cycling creatures, burn spells, and card draw. The key strategy is to maintain a fast-paced tempo and outpace your opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
