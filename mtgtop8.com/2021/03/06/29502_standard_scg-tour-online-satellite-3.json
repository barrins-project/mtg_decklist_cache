            "notes": "The deck focuses on using powerful creatures like Goldspan Dragon and Kazandu Mammoth to apply early pressure on the opponent, supported by efficient removal spells like Bonecrusher Giant and Spikefield Hazard. The deck aims to curve out smoothly with the help of Edgewall Innkeeper and Lovestruck Beast, generating card advantage and increasing board presence. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion adds an extra layer of consistency and damage output to the deck. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive game plan."
