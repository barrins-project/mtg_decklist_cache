By playing aggressively and cycling through cards efficiently, the deck can deal damage to opponents while generating card advantage. Cards like Flourishing Fox and Drannith Stinger help to cycle through the deck quickly, while creatures like Valiant Rescuer provide additional value. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of aggression and card advantage to secure victory."
