By utilizing cards like Ruin Crab and Soaring Thought-Thief to mill the opponent's deck, Drown in the Loch to counter spells and eliminate threats, and Into the Story to draw more cards, the deck aims to control the pace of the game and outvalue the opponent. Additionally, Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds resilience and card advantage, making it difficult for the opponent to keep up."
