By utilizing the cycling mechanic and cards like Valiant Rescuer and Flourishing Fox, the deck aims to create a steady stream of tokens while also dealing direct damage with Drannith Stinger and Irencrag Pyromancer. The deck also includes cards like Zenith Flare and Improbable Alliance for additional damage and card advantage. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and burn spells."

The deck focuses on aggressive creatures like Lovestruck Beast and Goldspan Dragon, supported by card draw from Edgewall Innkeeper and disruption from Brazen Borrower and Bonecrusher Giant. The deck also includes powerful spells like Alrund's Epiphany for extra turns and The Great Henge for additional card draw and ramp. Overall, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence and high damage potential."
