The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds resilience and recursion to the deck's game plan, ensuring that the aggressive strategy can be maintained even in the face of removal or disruption."

Cards like Visions of Beyond help to draw more cards when the opponent's library is low, while counters like Drown in the Loch provide some protection. This deck aims to win through decking the opponent out entirely, making it a powerful combo deck in the Modern format."
