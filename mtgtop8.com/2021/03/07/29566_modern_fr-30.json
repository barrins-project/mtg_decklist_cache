The deck includes a mix of disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to control the opponent's game plan, as well as removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to deal with opposing threats. Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by allowing you to recast creatures and permanents from your graveyard, giving you extra staying power in longer games."
