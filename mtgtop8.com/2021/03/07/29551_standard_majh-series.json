By cycling through cards such as Flourishing Fox and Drannith Stinger, the player can trigger abilities like Irencrag Pyromancer's direct damage ability or Valiant Rescuer's token generation. The key win condition is to accumulate cycling cards in the graveyard to power up Zenith Flare for a big finish, while also utilizing cards like Improbable Alliance and Rielle, the Everwise for additional value. The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent while cycling through its cards efficiently."
