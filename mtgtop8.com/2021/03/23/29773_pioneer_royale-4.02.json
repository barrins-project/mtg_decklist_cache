By using Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion, players have the ability to continually recast auras from their graveyard, ensuring consistent pressure on their opponent. The key strategy is to quickly buff up a creature with a variety of auras, making it difficult for the opponent to effectively block or remove the threat. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and efficient use of resources."
