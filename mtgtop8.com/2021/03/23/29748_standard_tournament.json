Goldspan Dragon provides a powerful finisher, and cards like Brazen Borrower and Alrund's Epiphany help control the tempo of the game. The deck also includes a companion, Obosh, the Preypiercer, to further enhance the damage output. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistent access to all three colors needed for this aggressive strategy."
