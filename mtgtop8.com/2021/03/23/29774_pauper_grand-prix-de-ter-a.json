By deploying cheap and efficient threats like Changeling Outcast and Guul Draz Vampire alongside direct damage spells like Bump in the Night and Sovereign's Bite, the deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent. Additionally, the deck includes disruption spells like Defile and removal spells like Soul Reap to clear the way for its aggressive creatures. Overall, the deck's strategy revolves around fast-paced aggression and resource denial."
