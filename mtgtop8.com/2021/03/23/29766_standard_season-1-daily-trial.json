The Great Henge provides additional card advantage and life gain, while Obosh, the Preypiercer enhances the deck's damage output. The mana base is optimized for consistency and allows for flexibility in color choices. Overall, the deck is designed to be fast-paced and disruptive, aiming to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
