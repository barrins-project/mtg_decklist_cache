Torbran, Thane of Red Fell boosts the damage output of all red sources, while Anax, Hardened in the Forge creates additional tokens when your creatures die. With a mix of efficient creatures and burn spells like Frost Bite, this deck aims to close out games quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
