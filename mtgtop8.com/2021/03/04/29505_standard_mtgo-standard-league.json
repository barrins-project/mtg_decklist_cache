By leveraging cards that mill the opponent's library, along with removal spells and counterspells, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage through effects like drawing cards. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds additional value by allowing for recursion of low-cost permanents from the graveyard. This deck aims to outlast the opponent by controlling the game and eventually winning through either milling or overwhelming card advantage."
