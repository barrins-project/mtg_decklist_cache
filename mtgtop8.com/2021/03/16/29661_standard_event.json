By equipping them with powerful equipment like Maul of the Skyclaves, it aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent before they can set up their own game plan. Cards like Halvar, God of Battle and Sentinel's Eyes provide additional aggression and resilience, while cards like Skyclave Apparition and Seasoned Hallowblade offer disruption and protection. With a strong curve and synergistic card choices, this deck aims to end the game before the opponent can stabilize."
