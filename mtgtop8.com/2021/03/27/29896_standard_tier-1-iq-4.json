By utilizing Yorion as a companion, the deck aims to maximize value by blinking permanents like Mazemind Tome and Omen of the Sea. Emergent Ultimatum allows the player to search for key threats or answers while Cultivate ensures consistent mana fixing and ramp. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Alrund's Epiphany and Kiora Bests the Sea God to close out games. With a strong mana base and versatile spells, Sultai Control looks to outvalue and outlast opponents in the late game."
