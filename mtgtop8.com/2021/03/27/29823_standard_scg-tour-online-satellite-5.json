Embercleave provides a powerful boost to one of the creatures, allowing for even more damage to be dealt in a single turn. The inclusion of Snow-Covered Mountains and Faceless Haven adds flexibility and resilience to the deck. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and powerful attacks."

By maintaining a low curve and constantly cycling through cards, you can overwhelm your opponent with a steady stream of threats while also being able to dig deeper into your deck for key pieces. Utilizing a mix of creatures, spells, and land cards, this deck aims to apply consistent pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
