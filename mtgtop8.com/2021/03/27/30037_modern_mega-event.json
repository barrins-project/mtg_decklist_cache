The goal is to continuously dredge through the deck, bringing back creatures from the graveyard and dealing damage to the opponent. Using cards like Cathartic Reunion, Shriekhorn, and Ox of Agonas helps facilitate these strategies, while also serving as ways to draw cards or discard unwanted cards. In essence, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a constant stream of creatures and graveyard interactions."
