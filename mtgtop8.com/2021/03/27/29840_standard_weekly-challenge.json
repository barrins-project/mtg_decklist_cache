The deck also includes control elements like Negate and Mystical Dispute to protect its creatures and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With efficient mana fixing from cards like Ketria Triome and Fabled Passage, the deck aims to consistently play threats and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
