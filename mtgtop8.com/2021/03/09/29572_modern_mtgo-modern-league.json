By casting Living End from either hand or graveyard, the player can sweep the battlefield and reanimate their creatures to overwhelm the opponent. Teferi, Time Raveler helps to protect the combo by preventing counterspells and disrupting opponents' strategies. Cryptic Command provides versatile control options, while Force of Negation can protect key spells. As Foretold allows for casting Living End for free, providing a huge advantage in tempo. The deck aims to quickly assemble the combo and win the game in a single explosive turn."
