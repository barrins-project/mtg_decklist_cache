The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent with creatures like Lovestruck Beast, Brazen Borrower, Goldspan Dragon, and Bonecrusher Giant, while also having the potential to close out the game quickly with cards like Shark Typhoon and Shatterskull Smashing. The mana base is built to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent land drops."
