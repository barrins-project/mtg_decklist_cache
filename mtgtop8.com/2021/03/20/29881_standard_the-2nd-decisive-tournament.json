Emergent Ultimatum is a key card that allows the player to search for powerful threats or answers, while cards like Heartless Act and Eliminate help deal with opposing threats. The deck also includes ramp spells like Cultivate to ensure the player can cast their big spells like Alrund's Epiphany and Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider."
