By utilizing efficient creatures such as Usher of the Fallen, Luminarch Aspirant, and Seasoned Hallowblade, the deck aims to establish early board presence and apply constant pressure. Support cards like Giant Killer and Skyclave Apparition provide removal options, while equipment like Maul of the Skyclaves buffs your creatures for increased damage output. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den allows for recurring low-cost creatures from the graveyard to maintain a steady stream of threats."
