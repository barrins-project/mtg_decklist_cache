The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows you to continuously recur low-cost permanents from your graveyard to maintain pressure on your opponent."

The deck focuses on controlling the game by using cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Oblivion Stone to disrupt the opponent's strategy while also utilizing ramp spells like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to quickly assemble the UrzaTron lands and establish board presence."
