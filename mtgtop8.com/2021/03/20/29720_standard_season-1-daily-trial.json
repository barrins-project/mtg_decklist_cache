Using cards like Emergent Ultimatum and Alrund's Epiphany, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and establish a strong board presence. With a mix of ramp, card draw, and powerful threats like Vorinclex and Kiora Bests the Sea God, the goal is to stall the game out until you can overwhelm your opponent with sheer card advantage and powerful spells."
