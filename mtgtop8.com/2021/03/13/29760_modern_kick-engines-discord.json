Protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing help keep your creatures safe, while cards like Spell Pierce and Spellskite provide additional defense. The goal is to assemble a combination of infect creatures and pump spells to win the game in a single explosive turn, before the opponent can mount a defense."
