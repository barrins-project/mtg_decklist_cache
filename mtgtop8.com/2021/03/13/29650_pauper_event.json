Silhana Ledgewalker and River Boa provide evasion and resilience, while Elephant Guide and Rancor pump up the creatures for additional damage. The goal is to apply constant pressure on the opponent, using the deck's low mana curve and efficient creatures to overwhelm them before they can stabilize or mount a defense."
