Improbable Alliance, Valiant Rescuer, and Flourishing Fox provide a constant stream of tokens, while cards like Drannith Stinger and Irencrag Pyromancer allow for direct damage. Cycling cards like Boon of the Wish-Giver and Startling Development help to fuel Zenith Flare, which can deliver a massive amount of damage to the opponent. Additionally, the mana base is optimized for flexibility and consistency. This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and efficient cycling."
