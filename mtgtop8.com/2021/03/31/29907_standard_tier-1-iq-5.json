By utilizing the synergy between aggressive creatures like Goldspan Dragon and Bonecrusher Giant, along with versatile cards like Brazen Borrower and Kazandu Mammoth, the deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Obosh as a companion provides a unique advantage by boosting the damage output of the entire deck. The addition of control elements like Mystical Dispute and Saw It Coming helps to ensure that the deck can maintain momentum and finish off the opponent quickly."
