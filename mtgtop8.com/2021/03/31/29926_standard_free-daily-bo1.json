It aims to quickly build a board presence and chip away at the opponent's life total while maintaining resilience with cards like Selfless Savior and Lurrus of the Dream-Den. The deck's strategy is to be aggressive and proactive, pressuring the opponent to react quickly or risk being overwhelmed by a swarm of weenies in white."
