It includes card advantage engines like Sarulf's Packmate and Bonder's Ornament to maintain tempo while also utilizing removal spells like Cast Down and Chainer's Edict to control the board. The deck also has a splash of burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fiery Cannonade for additional reach. With a strong creature base and a mix of removal and card draw, this deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain board presence to outpace opponents in a fast-paced game."

            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to utilize walls that generate mana to play powerful creatures with a combo finisher. By consistently drawing creatures with card advantage spells and using walls to ramp up mana, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with large creatures like Ulamog's Crusher and Annoyed Altisaur. The combination of mana ramp and creature advantage creates a strong synergy that can snowball into a decisive victory."
