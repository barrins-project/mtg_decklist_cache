Utilizing a combination of removal spells, counter spells, and card draw, the deck aims to disrupt your opponent's game plan and stall the game until you can establish a win condition, such as overwhelming your opponent with Shark Typhoon tokens or playing powerful planeswalkers like Ashiok, Nightmare Muse and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The land base is designed to ensure consistent mana fixing and to support the deck's control strategies."
