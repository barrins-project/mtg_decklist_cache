By utilizing cards like Conclave Mentor and Luminarch Aspirant, the deck can pump up its creatures and create a powerful board presence. The inclusion of cards like Necropanther and Polukranos, Unchained provides additional value by bringing back creatures from the graveyard or removing threats from the opponent's side. Overall, the deck aims to maintain a strong aggressive stance while also having some resilience and card advantage through its creature abilities."
