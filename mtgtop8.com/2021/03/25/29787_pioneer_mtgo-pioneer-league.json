            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing Enigmatic Incarnation to continuously tutor for powerful creature cards while controlling the board with removal spells and enchantments. The deck's strategy is to ramp up quickly with Nylea's Presence and Fires of Invention, then use Enigmatic Incarnation to trade lower-costed creatures for higher-costed threats. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by flickering permanents. The deck aims to out-value opponents with a versatile creature toolbox and efficient removal spells, ultimately overwhelming them with powerful threats."

By playing low-cost mana dorks like Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves, the deck can quickly get out bigger threats like Steel Leaf Champion and Old-Growth Troll. The deck also includes powerful cards like Collected Company and The Great Henge to generate even more value and pressure. Overall, the key strategy is to establish a strong board presence early and maintain pressure to quickly close out the game."
