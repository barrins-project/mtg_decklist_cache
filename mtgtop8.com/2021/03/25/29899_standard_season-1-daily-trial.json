The deck also includes cards like Lovestruck Beast and Edgewall Innkeeper to provide card advantage and maintain pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of cards like The Great Henge and Questing Beast offer additional versatility and resilience in longer games. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a relentless stream of threats and combat tricks."

By running a mix of removal spells, counterspells, and card draw effects, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent until it can assemble its powerful win conditions such as Emergent Ultimatum or Alrund's Epiphany to close out the game. With a solid mana base and flexible game plan, the deck is well-equipped to handle various threats and adapt to different matchups in a Standard 1 vs 1 format."
