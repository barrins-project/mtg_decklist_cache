The deck also includes mana acceleration in the form of Noble Hierarch and Gaea's Cradle, allowing for quick deployment of threats. Additionally, the deck includes ways to search for key cards with Green Sun's Zenith and Once Upon a Time, while also having resilient threats like Batterskull and Stoneforge Mystic. The deck aims to apply pressure early and disrupt the opponent's game plan to secure a victory."
