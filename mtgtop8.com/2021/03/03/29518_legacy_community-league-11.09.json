The deck also utilizes cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Shark Typhoon to maintain tempo and generate additional threats. Replenish and Hall of Heliod's Generosity provide recursion for enchantments, while cards like Cast Out and Swords to Plowshares offer versatile answers to opposing threats. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while slowly building up its own advantage to secure victory."
