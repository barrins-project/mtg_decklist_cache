The inclusion of powerful white creatures like Luminarch Aspirant and Skyclave Apparition, along with synergistic cards like Reidane and Glorious Anthem, amplifies the aggression of the deck. By curving out and buffing its creatures with various enchantments and equipments, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
