This mana is then used to cast combo pieces like Galvanic Alchemist and Bloodrite Invoker to create an infinite mana loop. The deck also includes card draw and creature search cards like Winding Way and Lead the Stampede to help find combo pieces quickly. The goal is to assemble the combo as fast as possible and overwhelm the opponent with a massive amount of mana and creature power."
