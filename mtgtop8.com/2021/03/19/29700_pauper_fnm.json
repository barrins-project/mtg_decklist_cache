By utilizing low-cost creatures with abilities like trample and evasion, combined with pump spells and enchantments to increase their power, the deck aims to deal large amounts of damage quickly. Cards like Quirion Ranger and Nettle Sentinel help to maintain a steady flow of creatures onto the battlefield, while Savage Swipe and Vines of Vastwood provide removal and protection. The goal is to outpace the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
