            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game with counterspells, removal, and planeswalkers, while also utilizing card advantage and tempo plays. It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, stall the game with removal spells and counters, and then establish a strong board presence with planeswalkers like Jace and Teferi. The deck can also win through alternative win conditions like Shark Typhoon or Celestial Colonnade. By managing threats effectively and out-valuing the opponent, the UW Control deck will outlast and eventually overpower the opponent."
