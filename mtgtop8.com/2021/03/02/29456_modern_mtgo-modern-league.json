The main win conditions include using cards like Omnath, Locus of Creation to pressure the opponent or eventually win through Celestial Colonnade beats.

By doing so, you can create powerful threats like Hangarback Walker and Walking Ballista while also utilizing cards like Arcbound Ravager and Arcbound Worker to further enhance your board presence. The deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with a multitude of growing creatures while providing protection with cards like Snakeskin Veil. Additionally, having lands like Inkmoth Nexus and Pendelhaven add extra versatility to the deck's strategy."
