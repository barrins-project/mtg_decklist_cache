The deck utilizes cards that support cycling, such as Improbable Alliance and Flourishing Fox, along with cards like Zenith Flare to finish off the opponent. Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a powerful companion that allows for additional recursion and value generation. The deck aims to quickly build a board presence and close out the game efficiently through efficient cycling and synergy between cards."
