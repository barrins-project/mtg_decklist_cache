Additionally, the deck aims to bring back key creatures from the graveyard with cards like Rally the Ancestors and Return to the Ranks. The deck's synergy revolves around sacrificing, triggering, and recurring creatures to maintain a strong board presence and chip away at the opponent's life total."
