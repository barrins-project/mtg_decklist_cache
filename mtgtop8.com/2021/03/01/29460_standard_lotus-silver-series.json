By using cards like Essence Scatter, Negate, and Saw It Coming, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage with cards like Narset of the Ancient Way and Behold the Multiverse. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Alrund's Epiphany, Shark Typhoon, Goldspan Dragon, and The Raven's Warning to close out the game once control has been established. The deck's mana base is designed to support both its control elements and its high-cost finishers."
