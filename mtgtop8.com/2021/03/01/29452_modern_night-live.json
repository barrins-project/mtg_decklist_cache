The deck aims to control the game through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw, while using versatile threats such as Shark Typhoon and Snapcaster Mage to apply pressure and close out the game. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency and provide access to all necessary colors of mana."
