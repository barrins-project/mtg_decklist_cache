By utilizing a combination of aggressive creatures like Anax, Fervent Champion, and Bonecrusher Giant, along with powerful equipment like Embercleave, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. Cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Castle Embereth provide additional damage boosts to help finish off the opponent swiftly. Utilizing snow lands for Frost Bite adds removal options while also providing access to Faceless Haven for additional threats."
