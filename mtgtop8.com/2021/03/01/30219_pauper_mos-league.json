The key to success lies in quickly assembling a critical mass of Slivers to benefit from their synergistic effects and create a threatening board presence that can quickly close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The deck also includes card draw and mana fixing to ensure consistency and keep the pressure on the opponent."
