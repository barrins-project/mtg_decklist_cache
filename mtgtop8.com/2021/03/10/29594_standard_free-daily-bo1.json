With a focus on snow-covered lands for consistency and utility lands like Faceless Haven for additional threats, this deck is built to maintain relentless pressure and end the game quickly."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while slowly milling their deck to win by decking them out. Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by recurring creatures and spells from the graveyard. The deck also includes card draw and selection to maintain hand advantage and find key cards. The mana base is designed to support the control elements and activate all necessary colors for the spells in the deck."
