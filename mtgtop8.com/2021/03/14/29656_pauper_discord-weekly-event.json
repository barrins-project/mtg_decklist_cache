By efficiently utilizing cards like Thermo-Alchemist and Ghitu Lavarunner to deal consistent damage, along with powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win the game before they can establish a strong defense. The inclusion of cards like Curse of the Pierced Heart adds additional pressure and inevitability to the deck's game plan."
