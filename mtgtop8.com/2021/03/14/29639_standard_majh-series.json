By playing high-impact threats like Torbran, Embercleave, and Anax, the deck aims to close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Snow lands and Faceless Haven provide extra utility and resiliency, while cards like Frost Bite and Rimrock Knight help maintain early pressure. The overall strategy is to stay on the offensive and apply constant pressure to force opponents to react defensively, ultimately leading to victory."
