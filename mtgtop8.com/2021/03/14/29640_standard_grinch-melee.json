The inclusion of snow lands enables the use of Faceless Haven for additional threats on the board. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and strong offense."

By using cards like Thieves' Guild Enforcer, Ruin Crab, and Soaring Thought-Thief, the deck aims to quickly mill the opponent's library. Additionally, the deck includes counterspells like Mystical Dispute, removal spells like Heartless Act, and card draw in the form of Into the Story to maintain control of the game. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion provides additional value by allowing the player to recur low-cost creatures from their graveyard."
