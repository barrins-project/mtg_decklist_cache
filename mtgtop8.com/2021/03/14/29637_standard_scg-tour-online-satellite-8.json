The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by maximizing card advantage and efficiency in its spells, ultimately grinding out a victory through attrition."

It utilizes creatures like Usher of the Fallen and Luminarch Aspirant to quickly build up a board presence, while also having protection and removal options with Selfless Savior and Skyclave Apparition. The goal is to continuously apply pressure to the opponent, making it difficult for them to stabilize and establish their own game plan. The inclusion of powerful cards like Halvar, God of Battle and Legion Angel provide additional threats and resilience to the deck."
