These creatures are supported by spells like Snakeskin Veil and Blizzard Brawl to protect and enhance their effectiveness. Additionally, the deck includes planeswalkers Vivien, Monsters' Advocate and Garruk, Unleashed to provide additional resources and threats. The overall goal is to quickly establish a dominant board presence and deal massive amounts of damage."
