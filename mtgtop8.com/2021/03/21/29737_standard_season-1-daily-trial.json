By using cards like Selfless Savior and Alseid of Life's Bounty to protect key pieces, and with powerful cards like Luminarch Aspirant and Halvar, God of Battle to boost the team, the deck aims to establish board control early and maintain pressure throughout the game. With a mix of aggressive creatures and removal spells like Skyclave Apparition and Glass Casket, the deck looks to close out games swiftly before the opponent can recover."
