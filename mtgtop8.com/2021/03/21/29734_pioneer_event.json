The inclusion of cards like Young Pyromancer and Dreadhorde Arcanist allows for generating additional value from casting spells, while the flexible removal spells like Fatal Push and Kolaghan's Command help to deal with opposing threats efficiently. The deck aims to close out games quickly through a combination of aggression and disruption."
