The inclusion of cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Nest Invader allows for additional creature and mana generation, while spells like Savage Swipe and Vines of Vastwood provide removal and combat tricks. The deck also benefits from pumping its creatures with enchantments like Rancor and Elephant Guide, ensuring continued pressure. Overall, the deck aims to maintain a fast and relentless assault."
