By consistently playing low-cost creatures and equipping them with powerful equipment like Maul of the Skyclaves, the deck aims to create a fast and aggressive board presence. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value and flexibility in recurring creatures from the graveyard. This strategy aims to pressure the opponent early and maintain tempo throughout the game."
