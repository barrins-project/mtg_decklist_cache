By playing multiple creatures each turn and utilizing equipment like Maul of the Skyclaves to boost their effectiveness, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and apply constant pressure to the opponent. With a mix of protective cards like Alseid of Life's Bounty and strong attackers like Luminarch Aspirant, the deck looks to establish dominance early in the game and maintain control throughout."
