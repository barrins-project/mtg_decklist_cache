Utilize high-impact cards like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell to deal massive amounts of damage. Use Snow-Covered Mountains and Faceless Haven to take advantage of synergies with Frost Bite and other snow-related effects. Keep the pressure on with efficient creatures like Robber of the Rich and Fervent Champion while maintaining a strong board presence with cards like Anax, Hardened in the Forge. Castle Embereth can help give your creatures that extra boost to finish off your opponent."
