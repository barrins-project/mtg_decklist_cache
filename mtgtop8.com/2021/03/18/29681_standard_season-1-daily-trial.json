            "notes": "The deck focuses on aggressive plays with the goal of quickly overwhelming the opponent with powerful creatures and utilizing Winota, Joiner of Forces to cheat out additional creatures and generate value. By assembling a strong board presence early on and leveraging the abilities of key cards such as Luminarch Aspirant and Basri's Lieutenant, the deck aims to apply pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. Additionally, the inclusion of disruptive cards like Drannith Magistrate and Reidane, God of the Worthy helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan and further solidify the deck's aggressive strategy."
