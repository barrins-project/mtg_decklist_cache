By overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of creatures, the deck aims to win through consistent damage output and efficient combat tricks. The combination of cheap creatures, auras, and protection spells creates a fast-paced and resilient aggro strategy that can quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
