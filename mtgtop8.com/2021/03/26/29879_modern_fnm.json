It aims to pressure the opponent early and prevent them from stabilizing by hitting their life total fast. It includes cards that deal damage directly to the opponent while also preventing them from gaining life, making it difficult for them to recover. The mana base is designed to ensure consistency and enable casting the spells on curve. Overall, the deck's strategy is to win the game as quickly as possible through aggressive play."
