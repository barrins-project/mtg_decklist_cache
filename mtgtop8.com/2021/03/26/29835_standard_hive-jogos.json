The inclusion of cards like Giant Killer, Luminarch Aspirant, and Skyclave Apparition allows for quick creature removal and buffing potential. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and maintain control by using cards like Seasoned Hallowblade and Alseid of Life's Bounty. With a mix of creature-based threats and protective spells, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient and powerful plays."
