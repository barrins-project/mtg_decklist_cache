The deck also includes disruptive elements like Negate and The Akroan War to control the opponent's game plan. The mana base is designed to support the three-color deck, allowing for consistency in casting spells. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and powerful spell interactions."
