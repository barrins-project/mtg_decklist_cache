By using powerful threats such as Goldspan Dragon and Brazen Borrower, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The inclusion of counter spells and card draw provides additional flexibility and resilience against opposing strategies. The mana base is carefully constructed to provide consistent access to all three colors of mana needed for the deck's diverse card pool."
