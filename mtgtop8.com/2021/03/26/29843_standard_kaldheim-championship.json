The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion enhances the deck's aggressive strategy by granting a damage bonus to all odd-costed creatures. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of fast creatures and impactful spells."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on using mill and counterspells to control the opponent's resources and disrupt their game plan. By slowly milling the opponent's deck with cards like Ruin Crab and Thieves' Guild Enforcer, while also using cards like Drown in the Loch and Negate to counter key spells, the deck aims to outlast opponents and win through attrition. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion provides additional value and resilience to the deck's control strategy."
