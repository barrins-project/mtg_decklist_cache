By utilizing Heritage Druid and Elvish Archdruid to generate even more mana, the deck aims to cast powerful creatures like Shaman of the Pack and Ezuri, Renegade Leader to quickly overwhelm the opponent. Collected Company allows for explosive plays by putting creatures directly onto the battlefield, while Realmwalker provides card advantage and synergy with the Elf tribe. The key strategy is to create a fast and efficient combo engine that can outpace and outvalue the opponent."
