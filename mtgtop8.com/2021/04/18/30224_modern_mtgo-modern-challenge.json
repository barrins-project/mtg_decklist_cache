With a strong suite of instant speed spells and versatile threats like Snapcaster Mage and Sprite Dragon, the deck aims to control the game while leveraging the graveyard with cards like Cling to Dust and Drown in the Loch. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion provides additional value by allowing the deck to recur low-cost permanents from the graveyard, adding resilience and flexibility to the control strategy."
