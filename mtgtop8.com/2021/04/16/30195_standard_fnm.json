By utilizing cards like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell to boost damage output, combined with powerful attackers like Bonecrusher Giant and Phoenix of Ash, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan. The inclusion of Frost Bite and Embercleave helps maintain pressure and close out games efficiently, while maintaining a consistent mana base with Snow-Covered Mountain and Castle Embereth."
