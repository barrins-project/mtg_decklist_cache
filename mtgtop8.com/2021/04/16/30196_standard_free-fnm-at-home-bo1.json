By playing low-cost creatures like Fervent Champion and Rimrock Knight, combined with powerful finishers like Embercleave and Phoenix of Ash, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Support cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Robber of the Rich add additional value and pressure to the board. With a mix of direct damage spells and resilient creatures, the deck looks to control the battlefield and secure a swift victory."
