The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful, hard-to-remove creatures while also gaining card advantage through drawing from the enchantments. The inclusion of the companion Lurrus of the Dream-Den allows for additional recursion of auras, furthering the deck's consistency and power level. By combining hexproof creatures with efficient auras, this deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents in the Modern format."

The inclusion of cards like Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds additional value by allowing the player to consistently bring back low-cost permanents from the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure from the early turns and close out the game quickly."
