By using cards like Muscle Sliver, Plated Sliver, and Predatory Sliver, it aims to boost the power and toughness of all Slivers on the battlefield. With Gemhide Sliver and Heart Sliver providing mana acceleration, this deck can quickly deploy its threats and put pressure on the opponent. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to refuel the hand with more creatures, ensuring a constant stream of threats."
