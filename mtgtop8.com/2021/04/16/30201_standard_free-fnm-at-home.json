The deck also includes cards like Bonecrusher Giant and Brazen Borrower for removal and disruption. The Great Henge provides additional card draw and ramp, while Alrund's Epiphany allows for extra turns to further push for victory. The mana base is optimized for consistency, with a mix of pathways and triomes for color fixing. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, powerful creatures and versatile spells."
