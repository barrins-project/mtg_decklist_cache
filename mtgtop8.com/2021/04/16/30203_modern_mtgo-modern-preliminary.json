This combo is supported by cards like Ranger-Captain of Eos and Collected Company to tutor and cast key pieces efficiently. The deck also features cards like Auriok Champion and Skyclave Apparition for protection and disruption. By utilizing mana acceleration with cards such as Arbor Elf and Utopia Sprawl, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent with an unstoppable combo."
