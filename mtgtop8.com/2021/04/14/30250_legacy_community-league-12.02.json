It utilizes cards like Dark Ritual, Chrome Mox, and Lotus Petal to quickly generate mana, while cards like Balustrade Spy, Undercity Informer, and Dread Return are used to put all cards in the deck into the graveyard. The deck ultimately aims to win through cards like Thassa's Oracle or Bridge from Below, and uses Pact of Negation to protect its combo from disruption."
