The goal is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with high damage output and efficient creature removal, while utilizing cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Embercleave to maximize damage potential. The inclusion of Snow-Covered Mountains allows for the use of snow synergies like Frost Bite and Faceless Haven to maintain pressure throughout the game. The deck aims to secure victory before the opponent has a chance to establish their own game plan."
