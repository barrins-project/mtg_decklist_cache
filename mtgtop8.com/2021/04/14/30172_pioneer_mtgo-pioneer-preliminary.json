The deck also includes disruption and removal spells like Fatal Push and Thoughtseize to control the opponent's board. The inclusion of Korvold, Fae-Cursed King as a powerful threat that also synergizes well with sacrificing creatures further enhances the deck's strategy of overwhelming the opponent with a combination of aggression and resilience."

This allows for powerful plays with cards like Voracious Hydra and Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider. The deck also includes removal options like Scavenging Ooze and Elder Gargaroth to maintain board control while applying pressure on the opponent with aggro creatures. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient and powerful green creatures."
