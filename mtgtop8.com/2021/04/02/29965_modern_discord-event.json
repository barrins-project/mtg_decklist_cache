With a mix of creature pump effects and token generation from cards like Goblin Chieftain and Mogg War Marshal, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and lethal assault."

The deck also includes versatile removal options like Oblivion Stone and Ratchet Bomb to control the board and protect its powerful threats. Overall, the key concept is to ramp up mana quickly and control the game until its massive threats can take over."
