            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and mill effects. By disrupting the opponent's strategy, milling their library, and generating card advantage through effects like Into the Story, the deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver its opponent. Thieves' Guild Enforcer and Ruin Crab serve as key pieces of the mill strategy, while Lurrus of the Dream-Den can provide additional value by recurring cheap permanents from the graveyard. The deck's win condition is to exhaust the opponent's resources and finish them off with damage or decking them out."
