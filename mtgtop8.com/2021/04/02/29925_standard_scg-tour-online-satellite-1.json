            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly and aggressively build a board presence using powerful creatures like Goldspan Dragon, Lovestruck Beast, and Bonecrusher Giant. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent and control the board with cards like Brazen Borrower and Mystical Dispute while also generating card advantage with Edgewall Innkeeper and The Great Henge. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion allows for increased damage output by only including odd converted mana cost cards in the deck. The mana base is designed to support the three-color Temur strategy efficiently."
