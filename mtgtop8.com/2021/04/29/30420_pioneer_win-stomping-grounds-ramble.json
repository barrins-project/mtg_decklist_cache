By playing creatures with powerful abilities like Spell Queller and Skyclave Apparition, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building a wide board presence with cards like Supreme Phantom and Empyrean Eagle. The inclusion of cards like Collected Company and Realmwalker allows for additional card advantage and the ability to quickly repopulate the board. With a mix of high synergy and powerful individual cards, this deck aims to quickly close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
