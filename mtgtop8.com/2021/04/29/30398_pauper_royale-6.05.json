This deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Suffocating Fumes, Echoing Decay, and Chainer's Edict, while also generating card advantage and gaining life with cards like Night's Whisper and Pulse of Murasa. The creatures in the deck, such as First-Sphere Gargantua and Sarulf's Packmate, help to pressure the opponent and close out the game quickly. Overall, the strategy revolves around aggressive plays and keeping the opponent on the back foot."
