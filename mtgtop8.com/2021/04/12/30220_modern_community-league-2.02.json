With cards like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident boosting the power of Merfolk, and cards like Merfolk Trickster and Tidebinder Mage providing control options, the deck aims to control the game tempo and apply pressure to the opponent. Aether Vial allows for quick creature deployment and Unsettled Mariner offers protection against spot removal. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion provides additional value and flexibility to the deck."
