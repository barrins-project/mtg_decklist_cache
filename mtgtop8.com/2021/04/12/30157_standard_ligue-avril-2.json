Cards like Righteous Valkyrie and Speaker of the Heavens provide extra value for playing creatures, while cards like Omen of the Sun and Linvala, Shield of Sea Gate offer protection and disruption. Starnheim Unleashed and Emeria's Call provide a late-game finisher, creating flying Angel tokens or flipping into a land that creates more Angels. Overall, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and close out the game aggressively."
