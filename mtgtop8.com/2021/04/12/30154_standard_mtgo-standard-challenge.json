The inclusion of Snow-Covered Mountains allows for the use of Frost Bite as a cheap removal spell. Castle Embereth and Faceless Haven provide additional sources of damage, helping to close out games quickly before the opponent can stabilize. Overall, the deck aims to end the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
