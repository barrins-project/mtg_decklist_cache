Utilizing the companion Obosh, the Preypiercer, all odd-costed cards in the deck provide additional damage and pressure. With the inclusion of efficient removal spells like Frost Bite and a reliable mana base with Snow-Covered Mountain and Faceless Haven, this deck aims to finish the game swiftly and decisively."

It disrupts opponents' strategies with cards like Drannith Magistrate and Elite Spellbinder while also generating card advantage and buffing its creatures with Showdown of the Skalds. The deck's finishing power comes from cards like Embercleave and Shatterskull Smashing, allowing for explosive combat turns to quickly close out the game. The mana base is streamlined for consistent access to both colors, ensuring the deck can execute its aggressive game plan effectively."
