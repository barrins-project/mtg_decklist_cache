By efficiently controlling the board and disrupting the opponent's strategy, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and maintain card advantage. With a good mix of creature removal, card draw, and hand disruption, the Mono Black Aggro deck can establish dominance early on and close out the game swiftly with powerful finishers like Gray Merchant of Asphodel."
