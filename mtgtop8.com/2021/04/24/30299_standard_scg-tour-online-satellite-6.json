Creatures like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell provide extra damage while cards like Embercleave and Frost Bite can finish off opponents or clear blockers. The inclusion of snow lands allows for the activation of Faceless Haven, providing an additional threat. Overall, the focus is on fast, efficient damage output to close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
