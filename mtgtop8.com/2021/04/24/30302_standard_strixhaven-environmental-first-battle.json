Utilizing cards such as Luminarch Aspirant and Seasoned Hallowblade, the deck focuses on creating a wide board presence while using protection spells like Alseid of Life's Bounty and Selfless Savior to keep its creatures on the battlefield. Maul of the Skyclaves and Shadowspear provide additional power and utility to the creatures, with Glass Casket and Skyclave Apparition serving as removal options. Faceless Haven provides a snow-covered land option for additional creature support."
