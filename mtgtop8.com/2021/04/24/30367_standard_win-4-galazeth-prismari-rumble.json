The deck focuses on playing powerful cards like Alrund's Epiphany and Bonecrusher Giant while also utilizing the landfall ability of cards like Scute Swarm and Dryad of the Ilysian Grove to create a constant stream of threats. The companion Keruga, the Macrosage helps ensure that the deck maintains a high card count and continues to generate value throughout the game."
