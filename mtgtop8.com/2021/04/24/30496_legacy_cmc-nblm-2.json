The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells and hand disruption, while keeping the pressure on with efficient threats. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize the effectiveness of fetch lands for deck thinning. Overall, this deck aims to be proactive, disruptive, and versatile in the Legacy 1 vs 1 format."
