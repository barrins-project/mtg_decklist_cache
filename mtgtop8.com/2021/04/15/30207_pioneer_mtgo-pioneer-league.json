The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with removal spells and disruption, while generating incremental advantage through card draw and recursion.

The key strategy is to use cards like Hidden Strings and Vizier of Tumbling Sands to untap Lotus Field multiple times, enabling explosive turns where the player can cast powerful spells like Peer into the Abyss. The deck also includes cards like Fae of Wishes and Strategic Planning to help find the key pieces of the combo. Players must carefully manage their resources and timing to execute the combo effectively and win the game."

With a mix of cheap artifacts and efficient mana sources, this deck aims to quickly establish a board presence and close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
