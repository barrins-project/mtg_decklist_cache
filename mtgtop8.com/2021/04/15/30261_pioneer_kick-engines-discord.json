The creatures in the deck have low mana costs and abilities that help increase the damage output, while the burn spells provide direct damage to the opponent or removal for their creatures. The land base is designed to support the aggressive strategy by providing consistent access to red mana sources. The companion, Lurrus of the Dream-Den, adds another layer of consistency by allowing you to continuously recur low-cost permanents from the graveyard."

This enables the deck to cast powerful spells like Peer into the Abyss to draw cards quickly and win the game. The deck also includes toolbox cards like Fae of Wishes to tutor for specific answers or win conditions. By untapping Lotus Field multiple times in a turn with cards like Hidden Strings and Vizier of Tumbling Sands, this deck can generate a huge amount of mana and overwhelm opponents with its powerful spells."
