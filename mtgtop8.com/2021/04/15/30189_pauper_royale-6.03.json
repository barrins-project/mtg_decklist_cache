            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to utilize cheap artifacts and affinity mechanics to flood the board with creatures quickly and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive attacks. By maximizing the use of artifact lands and cost-reducing cards like Frogmite and Myr Enforcer, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on. Cards like Atog and Fling provide additional ways to apply pressure and finish off the opponent swiftly. The inclusion of burn spells like Galvanic Blast and removal like Metallic Rebuke help maintain control of the game and secure victory."
