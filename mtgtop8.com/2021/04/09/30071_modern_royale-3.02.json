The main goal is to quickly reduce your own life total to power up Death's Shadow and Scourge of the Skyclaves, becoming formidable threats early in the game. The deck also utilizes Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion to provide additional recursion for small creatures and value from the graveyard. The combination of early aggression and disruption makes this deck a powerful aggro archetype in Modern."

By using cards like Leonin Arbiter and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, you can slow down your opponent's mana development and spell casting, while cards like Skyclave Apparition and Flickerwisp provide additional removal options. Stoneforge Mystic can search for equipment to boost your creatures, and Aether Vial helps you cheat them into play. With efficient removal like Path to Exile and land disruption like Ghost Quarter, this deck aims to control the game while beating down your opponent."

            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle by summoning a variety of powerful Sliver creatures and using cards like Aether Vial to quickly put them onto the battlefield. The inclusion of support cards like Unsettled Mariner and Realmwalker allows for extra versatility and card advantage, while the mana base of lands such as Cavern of Souls and Sliver Hive ensures that the deck runs smoothly and efficiently. Overall, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and quickly close out the game with a barrage of Sliver creatures."
