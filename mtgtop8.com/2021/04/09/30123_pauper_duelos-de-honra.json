The deck also includes cards like Peace Strider and Mulldrifter for control and card advantage, along with utility cards like Pulse of Murasa and Crop Rotation. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents by efficiently using its mana resources while controlling the board with creatures and removal spells."
