By combining powerful creatures like Gurmag Angler and Gray Merchant of Asphodel with disruptive spells like Defile and Chainer's Edict, the deck aims to control the board and chip away at the opponent's life total quickly. The deck is designed to apply pressure from the start and maintain that pressure throughout the game, ultimately winning through a combination of creature damage and draining the opponent's life total."
