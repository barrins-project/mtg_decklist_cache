By including cards that boost creature power and have haste, such as Fervent Champion and Embercleave, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with creatures like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Goldspan Dragon. Additionally, the deck utilizes burn spells like Frost Bite and Shatterskull Smashing to control the board and clear a path for attacking. Overall, the strategy is to maintain pressure and end the game swiftly with an onslaught of powerful creatures and burn spells."
