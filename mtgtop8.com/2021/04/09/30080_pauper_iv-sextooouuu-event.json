The deck aims to apply pressure early in the game, using efficient creatures like Bone Picker and Gray Merchant of Asphodel to chip away at the opponent's life total. With a mix of creature-based threats and removal spells like Chainer's Edict and Defile, Mono Black Aggro aims to maintain board presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan. The deck's mana base is streamlined with primarily Swamp lands, allowing for consistent access to the necessary colored mana for spells."
