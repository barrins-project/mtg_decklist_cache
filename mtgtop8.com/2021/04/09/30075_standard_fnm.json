By cycling cards like Flourishing Fox and Zenith Flare, you can deal damage to your opponent while also gaining value. Utilizing cards like Startling Development and Frostveil Ambush can help you protect your creatures and disrupt your opponent's game plan. The deck also includes some control elements with Neutralize and flexible mana fixing with the pathways. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with a fast and efficient aggro strategy."
