This allows for recurring creatures like Bloodghast and Prized Amalgam to come back into play and pressure the opponent. The deck also includes powerful card draw and discard effects like Cathartic Reunion and Thrilling Discovery to cycle through the deck quickly and set up explosive turns. The ultimate goal is to set up a huge Conflagrate or Ox of Agonas to finish off the opponent."
