            "notes": "The deck utilizes cheap artifacts to quickly flood the board and enable quick attacks. It focuses on combining creatures with affinity for artifacts with cards that benefit from having multiple artifacts in play. By generating a wide board presence early in the game, the deck can overwhelm opponents with fast and relentless aggression. The inclusion of some removal and card draw spells helps to maintain the deck's momentum and disrupt opponents' plans. Overall, the strategy of the deck is to deploy a swarm of creatures and quickly close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
