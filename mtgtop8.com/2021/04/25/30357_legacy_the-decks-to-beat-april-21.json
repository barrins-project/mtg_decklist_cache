            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly fill the graveyard with powerful creatures like Griselbrand and Ashen Rider, then use cards like Reanimate, Animate Dead, and Exhume to bring them back onto the battlefield for a powerful and explosive combo. The deck also includes disruptive cards like Chancellor of the Annex and Unmask to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The strategy is to efficiently reanimate high-impact creatures and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to respond."
