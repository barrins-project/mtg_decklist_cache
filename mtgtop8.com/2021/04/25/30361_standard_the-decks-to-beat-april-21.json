Utilizing snow lands for Faceless Haven, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's plans with cards like Drannith Magistrate and Elite Spellbinder while protecting its own creatures with Alseid of Life's Bounty and Selfless Savior. Legion Angel provides additional flying threats, while Maul of the Skyclaves can turn any creature into a significant threat."
