By playing efficient creatures like Burning-Tree Emissary and Nest Invader early on, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence. Cards like Vines of Vastwood and Hunger of the Howlpack provide additional ways to pump up creatures and push for damage. The inclusion of mana dorks like Nettle Sentinel and Quirion Ranger helps to ensure a smooth curve and consistent aggression throughout the game. Overall, the deck is designed to apply early pressure and maintain a strong offensive presence."
