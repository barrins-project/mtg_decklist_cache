By combining powerful creatures like Goldspan Dragon and Questing Beast with efficient removal spells like Bonecrusher Giant and Shatterskull Smashing, the deck aims to apply maximum pressure on the opponent early in the game. Supporting cards like Edgewall Innkeeper and Magda, Brazen Outlaw provide card advantage and ramp, while Embercleave serves as a finishing blow to secure victory. The mana base is designed to consistently provide the necessary colors for the deck's powerful spells."
