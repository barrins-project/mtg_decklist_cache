It also includes disruptive elements like Kitesail Freebooter and Thalia's Lieutenant to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Collected Company allows for explosive creature plays, while Dire Tactics provides removal for opposing threats. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and disruption, maintaining pressure throughout the game."
