The mana base includes lands that can produce both red and white mana, along with cycling lands to help smooth out the deck's draws."

By efficiently casting low-cost creatures like Frogmite and Myr Enforcer, and making use of cards like Gearseeker Serpent and Atog, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy. Using artifact lands and various artifact-based spells, the deck can generate a significant amount of card advantage while also dealing direct damage to the opponent with cards like Galvanic Blast and Fling. It is a well-rounded aggressive deck that can quickly close out games."
