The deck also includes removal options like Giant Killer and Kazuul's Fury to deal with opposing threats. Goldspan Dragon and Embercleave serve as powerful finishers, while Showdown of the Skalds provides additional card advantage and pumps up the team. The mana base is well-balanced with Fabled Passage and the Pathways to ensure consistent casting of spells."
