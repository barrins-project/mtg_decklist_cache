            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to disrupt your opponent's game plan through various forms of control such as Blood Moon, Pillage, and Karn, the Great Creator while ramping up your own resources with Utopia Sprawl and Arbor Elf. Additionally, it aims to apply pressure and close out the game with powerful creatures like Bonecrusher Giant, Bloodbraid Elf, and Glorybringer. The deck also utilizes cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Wrenn and Six for card advantage and utility. Ultimately, this deck focuses on resource denial, mana acceleration, and threatening creatures to dominate the game."
