The deck includes plenty of cheap and efficient creatures like Glistener Elf and Ichorclaw Myr, as well as pump spells like Groundswell and Giant Growth to push through damage and close out the game quickly. With a low mana curve and aggressive strategy, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win the game in a few quick turns."
