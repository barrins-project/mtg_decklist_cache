By combining these threats with efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to control the board and maintain pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Mishra's Bauble and Lurrus of the Dream-Den allows for consistent card advantage and the ability to replay key creatures from the graveyard. The deck is built to be fast and resilient, punishing opponents who are unable to keep up with its pace."
