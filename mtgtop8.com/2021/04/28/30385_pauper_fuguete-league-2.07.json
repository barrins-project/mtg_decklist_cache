These creatures are supported by cards like Disciple of the Vault, enabling consistent damage to the opponent. The deck also contains some versatile removal options, such as Galvanic Blast and Fling, to control the board and finish off the opponent. Additionally, the inclusion of card draw spells like Thoughtcast helps to maintain a steady stream of threats and answers throughout the game."
