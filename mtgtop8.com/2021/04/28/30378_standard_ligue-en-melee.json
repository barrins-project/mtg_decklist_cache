With cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Embercleave providing additional damage and utility, this deck aims to close out games swiftly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of Snow-Covered Mountain allows for extra synergy with Frost Bite and Faceless Haven, adding versatility to the aggressive nature of the deck. The goal is to consistently apply pressure and finish off the opponent before they can mount an effective defense."
