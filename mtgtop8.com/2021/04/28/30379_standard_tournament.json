By utilizing cards like Edgewall Innkeeper and Brazen Borrower for card advantage, and including control elements such as Mystical Dispute and Spikefield Hazard, the deck aims to maintain board presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion allows for additional damage output. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and consistent offensive game plan."
