By utilizing cards like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell alongside Embercleave and Frost Bite, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. With a strong emphasis on board presence and direct damage, this Aggro - Red Deck Wins archetype is designed to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain it throughout the game."
