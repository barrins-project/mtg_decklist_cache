The deck focuses on applying constant pressure with low-cost creatures like Fervent Champion, Robber of the Rich, and Fireblade Charger. It also utilizes powerful creatures like Bonecrusher Giant and Anax, Hardened in the Forge to control the board. The deck includes cards like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell to maximize damage output and allow for explosive plays. Additionally, Frost Bite provides versatile and efficient removal."
