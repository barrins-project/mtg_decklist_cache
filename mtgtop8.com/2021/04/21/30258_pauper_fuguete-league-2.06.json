The deck also utilizes cards like Bequeathal and Village Rites to draw cards and maintain card advantage. The inclusion of cards like Tragic Slip and Essence Harvest provides removal options and direct damage to close out games quickly. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of aggression and sacrifice mechanics."
