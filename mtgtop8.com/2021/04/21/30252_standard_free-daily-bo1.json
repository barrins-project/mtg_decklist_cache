The key strategy is to stall the game until you can generate value from powerful enchantments like Dance of the Manse and Doom Foretold, while also using Yorion, Sky Nomad to blink permanents for additional value. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by constantly generating card advantage and controlling the game state to eventually win through incremental advantage."
