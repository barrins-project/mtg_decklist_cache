With removal spells like Fatal Push and Murderous Rider to control the board, along with disruption from Thoughtseize, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient threats and maintain pressure with cards like Rankle, Master of Pranks and Spawn of Mayhem. The deck's land base supports this strategy with Castle Locthwain for card draw and Mutavault for additional creature attacks."
