The inclusion of Gyruda as a companion adds a unique twist by allowing for additional card advantage. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while building up its own resources to eventually overwhelm them with powerful threats like Massacre Wurm, Polukranos, and Bookwurm. Additionally, the deck benefits from synergy between its creatures and spells, creating a cohesive and versatile strategy."
