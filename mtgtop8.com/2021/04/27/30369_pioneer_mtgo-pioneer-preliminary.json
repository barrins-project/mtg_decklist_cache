Hidden Strings and Vizier of Tumbling Sands are used to untap Lotus Field for additional mana generation. Fae of Wishes allows for flexible access to sideboard cards, while Arboreal Grazer and Wolfwillow Haven help ramp up mana production. The deck aims to assemble the combo pieces quickly to overwhelm opponents with a massive spell or creature."

By combining aggressive creatures like Young Pyromancer and Dreadhorde Arcanist with various removal spells like Fatal Push and Bloodchief's Thirst, the deck aims to maintain board control while also generating card advantage through cards like Village Rites and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger. Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by allowing the player to recur important creatures and spells from the graveyard. The deck's consistency is further enhanced by its mana base, ensuring smooth gameplay and efficient aggression."
