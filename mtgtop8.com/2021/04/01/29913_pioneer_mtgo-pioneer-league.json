It aims to stall the game long enough to gain card advantage through draw spells like Dig Through Time and Shark Typhoon, while keeping the opponent's threats at bay. The deck also has a win condition in Shark Typhoon tokens or Torrential Gearhulk beats. The mana base is built to support the heavy blue and black requirements of the spells in the deck, with a mix of utility lands for additional value."
