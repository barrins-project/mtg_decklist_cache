With Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion, the deck aims to outvalue opponents by blinking permanents for additional value. The key strategy is to outlast opponents and grind them out with powerful control options."

The deck also includes some control elements with counterspells like Negate and removal spells like Fire Prophecy. The deck's finishers include powerful creatures like Koma, Cosmos Serpent and Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast. The mana base is designed to consistently hit all three colors (red, green, blue) needed for the deck's spells and creatures."
