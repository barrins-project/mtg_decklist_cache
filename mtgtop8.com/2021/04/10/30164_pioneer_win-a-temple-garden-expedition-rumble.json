By adding evasion with Curious Obsession and disruption with Unsubstantiate, the deck aims to maintain pressure and tempo. Tempest Djinn serves as a powerful finisher, leveraging the number of Islands in the deck to quickly close out games. This strategy aims to overwhelm opponents with early aggression and efficient counterplay."
