The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for recursion of key cards and adds versatility to the deck. Additional cards like Fatal Push and Crypt Incursion provide removal and lifegain, while Drown in the Loch acts as a versatile counter spell. The key strategy is to mill out the opponent before they can utilize their key cards."
