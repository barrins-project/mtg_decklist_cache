Cards like Drown in the Loch and Heartless Act offer removal options, while counterspells like Mystical Dispute and Disdainful Stroke provide protection. The deck also utilizes cards like Into the Story and Of One Mind to draw additional cards and maintain a strong hand. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game and outsmarting the opponent."

The combination of efficient creatures like Bonecrusher Giant and Lovestruck Beast, along with card advantage engines like Edgewall Innkeeper, allows the deck to maintain momentum and overwhelm the opponent. Additionally, Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast acts as a strong finisher by cheating out high-impact threats like Koma, Cosmos Serpent. The deck also includes a small suite of removal spells and counterspells to protect its threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
