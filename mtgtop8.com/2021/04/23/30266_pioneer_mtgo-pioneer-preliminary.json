By playing a companion, Yorion, Sky Nomad, the deck gains an advantage by flickering permanents for additional value. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Narset, Parter of Veils and Agent of Treachery to control the board state. With a mix of board wipes like Supreme Verdict and removal spells, as well as card draw and token generation, the deck aims to outlast opponents and win through incremental advantage."

The deck utilizes cards like Thopter Engineer and Voice of Resurgence to generate tokens and put pressure on the opponent. Eldritch Evolution can be used to tutor for important creatures, while cards like Pia Nalaar and Kenrith, the Returned King provide additional ways to pump up the board and secure the win."
