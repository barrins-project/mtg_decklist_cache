By combining creatures like Thermo-Alchemist and Ghitu Lavarunner with burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Fireblast, this deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. The inclusion of cards like Curse of the Pierced Heart provides consistent damage output, while cards like Searing Blaze and Skewer the Critics offer removal and additional reach. The deck's goal is to efficiently close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
