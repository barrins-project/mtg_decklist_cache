It also includes cards that benefit from sacrificing artifacts, such as Disciple of the Vault and Makeshift Munitions, to deal damage to the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures, burn spells like Galvanic Blast, and potentially game-ending combo plays like Fling or Temur Battle Rage on a pumped up Atog. The key strategy is to maintain a high artifact count to power up the synergies within the deck."

By efficiently utilizing the white weenies' synergy and the support of powerful equipment cards like Bonesplitter and Ancestral Blade, the deck aims to quickly build a wide board presence and apply consistent pressure to the opponent. Additionally, the inclusion of a few protection and evasion cards helps in ensuring the deck's creatures stay alive and keep the pressure on the opponent."
