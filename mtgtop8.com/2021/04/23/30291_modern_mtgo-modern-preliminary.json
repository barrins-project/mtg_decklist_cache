By recurring spells with Underworld Breach and tapping and untapping artifacts for value, the deck can generate a large amount of tokens with Monastery Mentor or win with Thassa's Oracle. Teferi, Time Raveler provides protection and disruption, while Emry, Lurker of the Loch helps to recur key artifacts. The deck also includes removal and card draw to help find the combo pieces needed for victory."
