It also includes protection in the form of counterspells like Force of Will and Veil of Summer. The deck is able to dig for key pieces with cards like Ponder, Brainstorm, and Cunning Wish. The inclusion of cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Ice-Fang Coatl offers additional value and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with high-impact creatures."
