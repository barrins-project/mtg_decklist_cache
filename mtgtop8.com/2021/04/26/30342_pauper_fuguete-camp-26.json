The key strategy involves sacrificing goblin creatures, such as Mogg War Marshal and Putrid Goblin, to generate resources like mana and damage. Cards like Skirk Prospector and Makeshift Munitions facilitate these sacrifices. Goblin Matron helps find crucial goblin pieces for the combo. Additionally, the deck utilizes card draw (Village Rites, Night's Whisper), tutoring (Shred Memory, Goblin Matron), and recursion (Unearth) to maintain a steady flow of resources. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a swarm of powerful goblin creatures."
