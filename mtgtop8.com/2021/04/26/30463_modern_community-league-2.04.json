The deck also includes ways to search for and protect these key combo pieces, such as Ranger-Captain of Eos and Skyclave Apparition. By ramping up mana with cards like Arbor Elf and Utopia Sprawl, as well as slowly growing creatures with Conclave Mentor and Gavony Township, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with an unbeatable life gain engine."
