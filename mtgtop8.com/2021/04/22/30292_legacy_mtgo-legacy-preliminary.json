Additionally, the deck aims to establish a mana advantage early on with cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Ancient Tomb to cast game-changing threats like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Karn, the Great Creator. The deck also looks to punish greedy mana bases with powerful disruption like Blood Moon and City of Traitors."
