By utilizing a mix of creatures with strong abilities, like Lovestruck Beast and Goldspan Dragon, as well as removal spells like Rip Apart, the deck aims to maintain board control while dealing significant damage to the opponent. Showdown of the Skalds provides card advantage and boost to creatures, helping to keep the pressure on the opponent. The mana base is optimized for consistent and smooth gameplay."
