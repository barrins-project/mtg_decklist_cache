It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by denying them resources while building up its own land base. By using cards like Crop Rotation, Life from the Loam, and Exploration, the deck can quickly assemble powerful land combos such as Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage. The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale provides additional disruption, while Valakut Exploration and Punishing Fire offer both card advantage and removal options. Overall, the deck excels at controlling the game through its efficient use of key lands and spells."

Cards like Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger help to untap creatures for additional mana generation and card draw, while Allosaurus Shepherd protects the combo from counterspells. The strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient combo."

By sacrificing creatures with Altar of Dementia and Bridge from Below, players can overwhelm their opponents with a steady stream of powerful creatures like Vengevine and Bloodghast. Cabal Therapy is used to disrupt the opponent's plans, while the land base allows for consistent mana fixing and access to the necessary colors. The deck aims to be aggressive and explosive, overwhelming opponents with a relentless swarm of creatures."
