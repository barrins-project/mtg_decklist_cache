The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while generating card advantage through cards like Mazemind Tome and Behold the Multiverse. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by flickering permanents for extra triggers. Overall, the deck focuses on outlasting opponents and gaining incremental advantages until it can overpower them with its late-game threats."
