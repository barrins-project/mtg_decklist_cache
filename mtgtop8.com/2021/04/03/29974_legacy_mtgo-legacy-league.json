By using Aether Vial to cheat out creatures and Wasteland to disrupt opponent's mana base, the deck aims to pressure the opponent and grind out incremental advantages. The deck also utilizes powerful equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte to close out games quickly. The combination of disruption, aggression, and resource denial makes this deck a versatile and powerful option in the Legacy format."

The deck also includes tools like Thoughtseize and Unmask to disrupt opponents' strategies and Burning Wish for additional versatility in finding key cards from the sideboard. The deck aims to assemble its combo pieces efficiently and win the game through powerful creature presence and card advantage."
