Goldspan Dragon provides a powerful threat while The Great Henge offers card draw and additional mana ramp. Mystic Dispute and Saw It Coming help control the opponent's spells, with Alrund's Epiphany offering a game-ending finisher. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion allows for increased damage output. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with efficient creatures and disruptive spells in a Temur color combination."
