By discarding big creatures like Griselbrand and Ashen Rider with cards like Faithless Looting and Unmask, players can cheat them into play early on, overwhelming their opponents with huge threats. With the support of cheap and efficient spells like Dark Ritual and Lotus Petal, this deck aims to exploit the graveyard as a resource to gain a significant advantage in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
