By constantly manipulating the board state and drawing cards, the player aims to outlast their opponent and establish a dominant position. The inclusion of cards like Stonehorn Dignitary and Sea Gate Oracle also helps in stalling the game and finding the necessary pieces to secure victory. Overall, the emphasis is on careful resource management and strategic decision-making to outplay the opponent."
