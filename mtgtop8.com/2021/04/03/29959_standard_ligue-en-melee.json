By using efficient card advantage engines like Robber of the Rich and Phoenix of Ash, along with damage boosters like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Embercleave, this deck aims to deal fast and consistent damage. The inclusion of Snow-Covered Mountains and Faceless Haven provide additional flexibility and resilience. Overall, this deck is designed to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out games swiftly."
