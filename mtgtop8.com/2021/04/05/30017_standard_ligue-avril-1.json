The deck focuses on creating a strong board presence and applying pressure early on. Key cards in this strategy include creatures like Torbran, Anax, and Robber of the Rich, which help deal extra damage and generate card advantage. Spells like Frost Bite and Embercleave provide additional ways to quickly increase damage output. The deck also takes advantage of snow lands to enable the use of Faceless Haven, a snow-covered utility land that acts as a threat on its own."

The deck includes cards like Embercleave and Kazuul's Fury to increase damage output and finish off opponents. Showdown of the Skalds helps generate card advantage and keep the aggression going.
