The deck leans on acceleration from Noble Hierarch and Stoneforge Mystic to quickly establish a dominant board presence. Teferi, Time Raveler provides disruption and protection for the deck's game plan, while powerful equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte give the deck additional reach and resilience in combat. The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain a strong presence on the battlefield to overwhelm opponents."
