The deck also includes cards like Ranger-Captain of Eos and Skyclave Apparition for removal and disruption, creating a resilient and flexible game plan that can quickly overwhelm opponents with its powerful combo potential."

            "notes": "The key concept of the deck is to control the game by utilizing various counterspells, removal spells, and card advantage engines. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering key spells, removing threats from the board, and generating card advantage through cards like Snapcaster Mage and Teferi, Time Raveler. The win condition is usually through incremental advantage and recurring threats like Shark Typhoon or Celestial Colonnade. The deck focuses on maintaining control of the game until it can establish a dominant position and close out the game efficiently."
