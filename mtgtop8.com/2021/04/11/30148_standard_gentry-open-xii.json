It also includes cards that provide additional benefits for these creatures, such as pumping them up or protecting them. The goal is to apply consistent pressure on the opponent and maintain a strong presence on the battlefield, making it difficult for the opponent to deal with multiple threats at once. The inclusion of powerful enchantments and equipment further enhances the deck's ability to close out the game efficiently."
