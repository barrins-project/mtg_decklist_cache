The deck includes low cost creatures with abilities that benefit from combat and spells that protect and buff those creatures. The goal is to establish a fast and strong board presence, utilizing cards like Dreadhorde Arcanist and Favored Hoplite to maintain pressure while protecting key creatures with spells like Boros Charm and Gods Willing. The deck aims to win by outpacing the opponent and dealing consistent damage before they can establish their own strategy."
