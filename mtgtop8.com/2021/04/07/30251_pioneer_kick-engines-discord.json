The deck aims to use removal spells like Fatal Push and Heartless Act to deal with threats, while countering key spells with Negate and Sinister Sabotage. The deck also utilizes card draw and selection tools like Opt and Dig Through Time to find relevant answers and threats. Additionally, the deck includes win conditions like Shark Typhoon and Torrential Gearhulk to close out the game once the opponent's resources are depleted."
