It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering their key spells, removing their threats, and generating card advantage through cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Dig Through Time. The deck also has win conditions in the form of Shark Typhoon and Torrential Gearhulk, allowing it to close out the game once it has established control. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistency in its performance."
