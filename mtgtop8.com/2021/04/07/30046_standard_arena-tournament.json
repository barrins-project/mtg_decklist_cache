The deck aims to stall the game with cards like Soul Sear and Fire Prophecy while building towards its win conditions, such as Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast and Harmonious Archon. By utilizing cards like Glass Casket and Omen of the Sun to manage threats, the deck aims to take over the game in the mid to late game with powerful creatures and enchantments."
