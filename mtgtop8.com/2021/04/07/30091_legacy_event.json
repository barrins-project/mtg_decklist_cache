It relies on cantrips like Ponder, Preordain, and Brainstorm to find the necessary pieces while also including interaction like Force of Will to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of Cunning Wish allows for additional flexibility and toolbox options."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Force of Will, Daze, and Stifle while deploying threats like Delver of Secrets, Tarmogoyf, and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to close out the game. Additionally, the inclusion of card advantage sources like Brainstorm and Ponder helps maintain the deck's consistency and versatility in different game situations."
