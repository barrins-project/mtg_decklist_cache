By combining creatures that benefit from casting cheap spells, such as Clever Lumimancer and Leonin Lightscribe, with combat tricks like Defiant Strike and Fight as One, the deck aims to maintain a strong board presence and constantly apply pressure. The inclusion of spells like Show of Confidence and Of One Mind helps to keep the hand full of resources, allowing for consistent plays throughout the game."
