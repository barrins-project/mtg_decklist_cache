Utilizing cards like Mortician Beetle and Hunger of the Howlpack to grow creatures and increase damage output, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient aggression. Removal spells like Tragic Slip and Snuff Out help control the board while cards like Rancor and Unearth provide additional value and resiliency. The deck is focused on putting pressure on the opponent early and maintaining that pressure throughout the game."
