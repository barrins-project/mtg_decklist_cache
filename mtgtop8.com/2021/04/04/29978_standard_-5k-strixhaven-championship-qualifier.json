By cycling through your deck quickly with cards like Startling Development and Zenith Flare, you can maintain pressure and finish off your opponent with a big burst of damage. Cards like Improbable Alliance and Frostveil Ambush provide additional ways to generate tokens and disrupt your opponent's plans. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to all colors needed for your spells."

The deck includes high-value creatures like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Bonecrusher Giant, along with efficient combat tricks like Embercleave. The deck also benefits from Snow-Covered Mountains to enable Frost Bite, allowing for additional removal options. Overall, the strategy relies on building a strong board presence quickly and dealing massive damage to the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
