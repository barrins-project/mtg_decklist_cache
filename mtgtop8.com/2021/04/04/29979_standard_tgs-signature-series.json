By playing efficient creatures like Fervent Champion and Bonecrusher Giant, as well as powerful spells like Frost Bite and Embercleave, the goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can stabilize. The inclusion of snow lands and Faceless Haven gives the deck some resilience against removal and provides additional threats. Overall, this deck aims to win the game through fast, efficient beatdowns and direct damage."
