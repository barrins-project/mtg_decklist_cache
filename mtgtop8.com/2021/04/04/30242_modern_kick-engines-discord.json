The deck also includes Past in Flames to allow for recursion of spells already used and Gifts Ungiven to tutor for key combo pieces."

The inclusion of cards like Emrakul, the Promised End and Mindslaver provide alternate win conditions while Engineered Explosives, Chalice of the Void, and Relic of Progenitus help with dealing with a wide range of threats from the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to dominate the late game by outvaluing and outlasting the opponent."

Aether Vial accelerates the deployment of creatures, and cards like Noble Hierarch and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben provide additional support. The mana base is optimized for consistent casting of the deck's many colored spells, ensuring that the aggressive strategy can continue uninterrupted."

The deck also includes counterspells like Mana Leak and Force of Negation to control the board. The card advantage and flexibility provided by Snapcaster Mage and Opt, along with card selection from Serum Visions, help maintain a steady tempo. With a mix of burn spells, counterspells, and evasive threats, the deck aims to quickly pressure the opponent while disrupting their game plan."
