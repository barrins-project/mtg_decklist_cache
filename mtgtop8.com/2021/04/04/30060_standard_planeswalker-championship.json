With a focus on Red creatures and burn spells, the deck aims to control the board early and maintain pressure throughout the game. Key cards such as Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Embercleave provide additional damage and combat prowess, while creatures like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Bonecrusher Giant offer resilience and versatility in combat. The deck's win condition is to outpace opponents and finish them off before they can stabilize."
