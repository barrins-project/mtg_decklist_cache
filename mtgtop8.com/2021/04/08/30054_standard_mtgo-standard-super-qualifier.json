The deck also includes removal spells such as Bonecrusher Giant and Brazen Borrower to control the board and protect its own creatures. The Akroan War is included to help further disrupt the opponent's game plan while also providing additional threats to the board. This deck aims to win the game by overwhelming the opponent with a mix of aggression and control elements."
