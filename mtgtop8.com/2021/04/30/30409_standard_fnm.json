It utilizes cards like Usher of the Fallen, Luminarch Aspirant, and Seasoned Hallowblade to create a strong early game and maintain pressure. With cards like Skyclave Apparition and Giant Killer providing removal options, the deck aims to keep the opponent's board clear while continuously applying pressure with its weenie creatures. The inclusion of cards like Lurrus of the Dream-Den and Maul of the Skyclaves helps to maximize the deck's efficiency and versatility."
