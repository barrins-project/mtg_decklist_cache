The focus is on controlling the board with creatures like Goldspan Dragon and Brazen Borrower, while also having access to removal spells like Bonecrusher Giant. The addition of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by blinking permanents for extra card advantage. The deck aims to outvalue opponents and control the game until it can overpower them with big threats."
