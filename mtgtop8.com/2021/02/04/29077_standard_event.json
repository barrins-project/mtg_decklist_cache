The deck also includes removal spells like Murderous Rider and Extinction Event to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Revenge of Ravens helps to punish the opponent for attacking and provides additional life gain. The goal is to maintain pressure on the opponent while slowly draining their life and grinding out a victory."
