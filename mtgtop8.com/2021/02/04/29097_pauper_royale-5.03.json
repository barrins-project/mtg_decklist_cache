            "notes": "The main concept of this Mono Black Aggro deck is to apply early pressure on the opponent while disrupting their hand and removal spells. The deck focuses on playing efficient creatures like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Chittering Rats, along with removal spells like Cast Down and Chainer's Edict to control the board. The inclusion of card draw with Sign in Blood and card advantage with Thorn of the Black Rose helps maintain momentum. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and consistent damage, while also disrupting their game plan with Duress and Defile."
