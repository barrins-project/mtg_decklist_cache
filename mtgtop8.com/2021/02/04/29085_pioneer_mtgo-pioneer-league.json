By playing a low curve of creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Bonecrusher Giant, combined with efficient burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and finish the game as quickly as possible. The inclusion of cards like Light Up the Stage and Ramunap Ruins helps to maintain card advantage and deal additional damage even when resources are running low."
