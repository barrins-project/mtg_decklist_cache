With a mix of counterspells, board wipes, card draw, and removal options, it aims to outvalue the opponent and stall the game until it can establish a dominant position. The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value by repeatedly blinking permanents for extra value. The deck aims to control the pace of the game and eventually overwhelm the opponent with its superior late-game threats and card advantage."
