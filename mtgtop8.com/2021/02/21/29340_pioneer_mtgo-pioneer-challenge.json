With a focus on sacrificing creatures for value and recurring spells from the graveyard, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building a threatening board presence. Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds additional value by allowing for recurring cards from the graveyard. Overall, the deck seeks to be fast, aggressive, and resilient in order to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent."
