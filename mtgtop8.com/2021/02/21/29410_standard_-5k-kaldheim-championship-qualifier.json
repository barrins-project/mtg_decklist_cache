            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly cycling through cards to build a wide board of creatures and generate value from card draw abilities. It utilizes the cycling mechanic to maintain card advantage and pressure opponents with aggressive creatures like Flourishing Fox and Drannith Stinger. Zenith Flare acts as a finisher by dealing damage based on the number of cards cycled, while cards like Improbable Alliance and Valiant Rescuer provide additional threats. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a constant stream of creatures and burn spells while keeping the pressure on with its aggressive playstyle."
