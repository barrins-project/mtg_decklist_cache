By utilizing cards like Usher of the Fallen and Luminarch Aspirant, this deck aims to flood the board with creatures and use equipment like Maul of the Skyclaves to enhance their effectiveness in combat. Additionally, cards like Skyclave Apparition provide removal options to control the opponent's board while maintaining pressure. The goal is to establish dominance in the early game and maintain it throughout the match."
