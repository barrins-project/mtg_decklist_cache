            "notes": "Utilizing a mixture of countermagic, removal, and efficient creatures, this deck aims to control the game through disrupting the opponent's strategy while developing its own board presence. By leveraging powerful cards such as Snapcaster Mage and Teferi, Time Raveler, the deck seeks to outvalue the opponent and dominate the battlefield. Stoneforge Mystic helps to search for key equipment pieces like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine to further enhance its creatures. With a blend of tempo plays and card advantage, this UWx Midrange deck looks to outmaneuver its opponents and come out ahead in the late game."
