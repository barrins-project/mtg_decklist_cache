It utilizes cards like Flourishing Fox and Drannith Stinger to cycle through the deck while dealing damage to the opponent. Valiant Rescuer and Rielle, the Everwise provide additional card draw and buffs, while Frostveil Ambush and Clearwater Pathway help control the board. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of cycling cards and finish them off with a massive Zenith Flare, making for a fast-paced and aggressive strategy."
