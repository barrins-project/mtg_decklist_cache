With a focus on burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Boros Charm, as well as fast creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to pressure the opponent early and maintain that pressure throughout the game. Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze help to control the opponent's board while Skullcrack and Lightning Helix provide additional burn and disruption. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive gameplay."
