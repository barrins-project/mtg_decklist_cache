By combining efficient creatures like Goldspan Dragon and Lovestruck Beast with combat tricks like Unleash Fury and Kazuul's Fury, the deck aims to quickly deal large amounts of damage to the opponent. Showdown of the Skalds provides card advantage and helps maintain pressure on the opponent. The mana base is optimized for consistent access to all three colors, allowing for smooth gameplay and powerful synergies."
