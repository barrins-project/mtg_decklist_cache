The deck also includes card draw and selection tools like Omen of the Sea and Treacherous Blessing to ensure a steady stream of resources. Yorion, Sky Nomad acts as both a companion and a flicker effect for value."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on using a variety of control cards to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain board control. By utilizing a mixture of removal spells, counterspells, and enchantments, the deck aims to out-value and outlast the opponent until it can win the game with powerful finishers like Dance of the Manse, Emeria's Call, and Archon of Sun's Grace. Yorion, Sky Nomad serves as both a companion and a key piece of the deck's strategy, allowing for additional value and flexibility in the late game. Ultimately, the goal is to grind out the opponent and secure a victory through resource management and strategic decision-making."

This deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, generate card advantage through card draw and scrying effects, and eventually win through incremental advantages and powerful threats like Shark Typhoon. The mana base is designed to support the control game plan with options for both controlling the opponent's resources and developing its own board presence."

The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional recursion of creatures and equipment, adding to the deck's overall consistency and resilience. This deck archetype relies on speed and aggression to overwhelm opponents before they have a chance to establish their own game plan."
