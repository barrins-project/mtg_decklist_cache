By using cards like Violent Outburst and Ardent Plea to cascade into Teferi, Time Raveler and other powerful creatures, the deck aims to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win condition. Valki, God of Lies is a key component of the deck, allowing for hand disruption and potentially stealing powerful creatures from the opponent. The deck also includes counterspells and removal to protect its combo pieces and maintain board control."

By using Cascade cards like Violent Outburst and Ardent Plea, the player can continuously cascade into cheaper spells, disrupting the opponent's game plan and potentially finding powerful answers such as Teferi, Time Raveler. The deck also includes control elements like Force of Negation and Mystical Dispute to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's strategy."
