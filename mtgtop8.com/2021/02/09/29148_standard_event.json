It also utilizes cards like Claim the Firstborn and The Akroan War to disrupt the opponent's board and gain advantage. The deck includes some graveyard recursion with cards like Ox of Agonas and Tymaret to maintain pressure on the opponent. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of fast creatures, removal spells, and disruptive effects to win the game as quickly as possible."
