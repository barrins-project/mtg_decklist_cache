Utilizing mana acceleration from cards like Lotus Cobra, the deck aims to quickly ramp up and play high-impact threats like Goldspan Dragon and Lovestruck Beast. The synergy between creatures like Edgewall Innkeeper and Showdown of the Skalds allows for card advantage and board presence. The Great Henge provides additional value and life gain, while Embercleave serves as a potent finisher. Overall, the deck aims to pressure the opponent early and maintain board control to secure victory."
