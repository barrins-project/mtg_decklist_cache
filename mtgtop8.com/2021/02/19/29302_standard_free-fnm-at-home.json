Giant Killer and Skyclave Apparition provide removal options for bigger threats, while Seasoned Hallowblade and Halvar, God of Battle add versatility to the deck's strategy. Reidane, God of the Worthy helps disrupt opponents' plans, and Faceless Haven provides a powerful snow mana option. This deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly and efficiently with a consistent flow of threats."
