The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value by flickering permanents for extra effects. The deck also includes big finishers such as Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Koma, Cosmos Serpent to help close out the game once control has been established. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements, with a mix of dual lands and basic lands to ensure smooth mana production."
