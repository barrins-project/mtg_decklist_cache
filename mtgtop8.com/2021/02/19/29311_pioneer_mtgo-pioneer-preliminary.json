The deck utilizes powerful removal spells like Wild Slash and Draconic Roar to control the board and counter spells efficiently with cards like Censor and Silumgar's Scorn. By efficiently controlling the game and generating value through cards like Dig Through Time and Goldspan Dragon, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents in a slower-paced game. Additionally, the deck includes efficient lands to ensure consistent mana access for its spells."
