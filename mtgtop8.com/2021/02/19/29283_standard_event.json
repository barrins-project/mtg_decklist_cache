The deck utilizes powerful threats like Goldspan Dragon and Shark Typhoon to close out the game once control is established. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to all colors of mana needed for the spells in the deck. Overall, the strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while advancing your own win conditions to secure victory."
