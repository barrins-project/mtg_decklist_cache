By ramping into big threats like Reality Smasher and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can fully set up their own strategy. The inclusion of cards like All Is Dust and Warping Wail provides additional versatility and answers to different situations, making it a solid Aggro deck with a touch of control elements."
