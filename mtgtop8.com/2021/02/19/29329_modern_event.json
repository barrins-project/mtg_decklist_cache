Creatures like Bomat Courier, Soul-Scar Mage, Monastery Swiftspear, Bonecrusher Giant, and Seasoned Pyromancer provide additional damage and pressure. The companion Obosh, the Preypiercer adds extra damage when odd mana cost cards are played. The deck aims to maintain a fast-paced aggressive strategy to overwhelm the opponent and win the game quickly."
