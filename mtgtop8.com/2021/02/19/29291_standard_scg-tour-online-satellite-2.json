It utilizes equipment like Maul of the Skyclaves and Sentinel's Eyes to increase the power and resilience of its creatures. The deck also benefits from the snow theme, utilizing Faceless Haven and Snow-Covered Plains for additional versatility and resilience."

By combining various White creatures with powerful enchantments and equipments, the deck aims to buff up its creatures and push through damage quickly. The inclusion of snow-covered lands allows for synergy with certain cards and enables access to Faceless Haven as a powerful snowmobile. This deck is all about maintaining consistent pressure on the opponent through efficient creatures and powerful buffs."
