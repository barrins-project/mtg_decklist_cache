By utilizing cards that provide acceleration like Simian Spirit Guide and Chrome Mox, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence early on and overwhelm the opponent with hasty creatures like Fireflux Squad, Legion Warboss, and Goblin Rabblemaster. This aggressive strategy aims to close out the game before the opponent can recover."
