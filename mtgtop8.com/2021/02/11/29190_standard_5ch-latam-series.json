It aims to stall the game with control elements until it can resolve a game-winning spell or combo, such as Emergent Ultimatum or Alrund's Epiphany. The companion Yorion, Sky Nomad provides additional value by blinking permanents for card advantage and board control. By generating incremental advantage and out-valuing opponents, the deck seeks to grind out victories in a longer game."
