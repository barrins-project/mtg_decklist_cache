Simian Spirit Guide allows for explosive starts, and Supreme Verdict is a backup plan against aggressive decks. The deck also includes a small Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath package for late-game value. Overall, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and overwhelm opponents with powerful threats."

The deck also includes powerful utility cards like Leyline of Sanctity to protect against disruption, ensuring that the combo can be executed successfully.

It also includes disruption in the form of hand disruption with Inquisition of Kozilek, removal with Fatal Push, and graveyard hate with Surgical Extraction. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with mill effects, using cards like Mesmeric Orb to continuously mill cards each turn and draw cards with Visions of Beyond to fuel the strategy."
