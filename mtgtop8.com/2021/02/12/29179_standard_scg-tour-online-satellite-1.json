With a variety of spells that can handle both creatures and other threats, along with powerful sorceries and enchantments that can swing the game in your favor, the deck aims to control the pace of the game until you can eventually overwhelm your opponent with powerful cards like Emergent Ultimatum and Shark Typhoon. The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value through blinking permanents, providing extra advantage in the late game."
