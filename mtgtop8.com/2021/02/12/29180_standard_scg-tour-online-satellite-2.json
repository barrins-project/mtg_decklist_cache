By constantly cycling through the deck, the player can power up Zenith Flare to deal massive damage to the opponent. Memory Leak disrupts the opponent's hand while Frostveil Ambush provides a way to protect the board. The deck is aggressive and aims to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of cycling cards and powerful Zenith Flare finishers. Rielle, the Everwise provides card draw and Flourishing Fox, Drannith Stinger, and Valiant Rescuer are key creatures for the aggro strategy."
