The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent early in the game with efficient creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, while using direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike to finish off the opponent. Eidolon of the Great Revel punishes the opponent for playing non-creature spells, and Wayward Guide-Beast helps ensure a steady stream of damage. The mana base is built to support the aggressive strategy with a mix of fetchlands and shocklands."
