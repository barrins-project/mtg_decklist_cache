The deck also includes removal spells like Banishing Light and Declaration in Stone to deal with threats. The strategy revolves around applying pressure early on and maintaining board control to secure victory."

Cards like Spell Queller and Rattlechains provide disruption and tempo advantage, while Selfless Spirit and Lofty Denial help protect your creatures and spells. With a mix of evasion, counterspells, and creature buffs, you aim to close out the game swiftly and efficiently."
