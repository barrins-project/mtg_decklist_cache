Kenrith, the Returned King provides additional support and synergy with the rest of the deck. The inclusion of Haktos the Unscarred adds a resilient threat to the battlefield, while cards like Claim the Firstborn and Castle Embereth offer ways to disrupt the opponent's strategy and push for the win."
