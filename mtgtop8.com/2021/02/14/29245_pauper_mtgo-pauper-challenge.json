This mana is then used to play powerful combo pieces like Annoyed Altisaur and Tuktuk Rubblefort to overwhelm your opponent. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help you dig for your combo pieces, while cards like Boarding Party and Valakut Invoker provide alternate win conditions. Overall, the deck focuses on building a resilient wall while executing a powerful combo to secure victory."
