The deck also focuses on generating tokens, gaining life, and creating flying threats to apply pressure and eventually win the game. The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for extra value by blinking permanents for additional triggers. Overall, this deck aims to efficiently control the game and overwhelm the opponent with its versatile and powerful cards."
