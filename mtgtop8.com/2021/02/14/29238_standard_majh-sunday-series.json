With Torbran, Thane of Red Fell amplifying damage dealt, alongside Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Rimrock Knight providing early pressure, and Embercleave as a game-ending threat, this deck aims to close out games quickly. The inclusion of Snow-Covered Mountains enables the use of Frost Bite and Faceless Haven to maintain aggression in matches. Overall, this deck is focused on fast-paced, direct damage to secure victory."
