It also includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Force of Negation to protect the combo pieces. Oko, Thief of Crowns and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provide additional value and stabilization in the early game. The deck aims to control the game through interaction and disruption while setting up a powerful combo finish with Valki, God of Lies."
