            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to swarm the battlefield with small, efficient creatures while utilizing various equipment cards to pump them up and protect them. The focus is on aggression and overwhelming the opponent with a continuous stream of threats. The inclusion of Lurrus as a companion adds additional value by allowing for the recursion of key creatures or equipment from the graveyard. The deck aims to win through quick and consistent damage output, leveraging the synergy between the creatures, equipment, and the deck's overall strategy."
