The mana base includes a mix of fetch lands and dual lands to support the deck's color requirements.

With a mix of disruption and card advantage engines like Narset and Sylvan Library, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent while keeping the board under control using cards like Terminus and Swords to Plowshares. The inclusion of Uro provides additional card advantage and a strong threat, while the mana base ensures consistency in casting spells of multiple colors. Overall, the deck aims to maintain control of the game until it can establish a dominant position and close out the game."
