The inclusion of Sunscape Familiar and God-Pharaoh's Faithful also helps to gain incremental advantage and stabilize against aggressive decks.

The deck also includes creatures with powerful enters-the-battlefield effects like Mold Shambler and Llanowar Visionary, and utilizes bounce effects like Ephemerate and Kor Skyfisher to continuously gain value and control the board."
