Ephemerate is a key card that can blink creatures like Mulldrifter and Sea Gate Oracle to draw additional cards or disrupt the opponent's plans. The deck also includes efficient card selection spells like Preordain and Brainstorm to help find the necessary answers. By efficiently managing resources and outvaluing the opponent, this deck aims to grind out a victory in a long game."
