Palace Sentinels helps maintain card advantage, while Crypt Rats and Pestilence can finish off opponents once the board is under control. The Orzhov lands provide both mana fixing and additional lifegain to help stall the game until victory."

By constantly applying pressure with creatures like Ghitu Lavarunner and Firebrand Archer, as well as spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, the goal is to reduce the opponent's life total to zero as fast as possible. The inclusion of cards like Searing Blaze and Curse of the Pierced Heart further adds to the deck's overall strategy of dealing damage efficiently and effectively."
