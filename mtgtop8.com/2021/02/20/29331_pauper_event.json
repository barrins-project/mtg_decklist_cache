The deck aims to control the board and drain the opponent's life total to zero as quickly as possible, using powerful creatures like Gurmag Angler and Bone Picker along with efficient removal spells like Disfigure and Chainer's Edict. The deck also includes some card draw and recursion options to maintain card advantage and ensure it can keep the pressure on the opponent."
