It also includes card advantage and selection options like Cultivate, Omen of the Sea, and Mazemind Tome to ensure a steady stream of resources.

The deck also includes cards that provide protection, such as Alseid of Life's Bounty and Selfless Savior, as well as cards that can pump up the creatures' power and toughness, like Halvar, God of Battle. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a Companion allows the player to constantly bring back small creatures from the graveyard to maintain pressure on the opponent."
