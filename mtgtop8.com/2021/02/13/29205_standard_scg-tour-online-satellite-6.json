It also employs cards like Into the Roil and Graven Lore for targeted removal and additional card advantage. Alrund's Epiphany and Shark Typhoon serve as win conditions, generating powerful tokens or extra turns. The deck's consistency and flexibility are enhanced by Behold the Multiverse and Saw It Coming, enabling strategic decision-making and adaptability."

The deck is built around cards that have cycling abilities and are able to generate value from cycling, such as Zenith Flare and Rielle, the Everwise. By consistently cycling through cards, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of card advantage and direct damage from Zenith Flare. The mana base is also constructed to support a smooth cycling strategy with a balance of pathways and triomes."
