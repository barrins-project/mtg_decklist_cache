The deck focuses on generating card advantage through spells like Behold the Multiverse and Graven Lore to ensure consistent access to resources. It also includes powerful win conditions like Alrund's Epiphany and Shark Typhoon to close out the game. Additionally, Frost Augur and Brazen Borrower provide early-game disruption and tempo advantage. The deck also includes a few situational counterspells and bounce spells, such as Mystical Dispute and Into the Roil, to address specific threats."
