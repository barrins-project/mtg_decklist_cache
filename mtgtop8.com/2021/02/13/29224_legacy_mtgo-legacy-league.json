Ethereal Armor boosts your creatures' power and toughness while maintaining card advantage. Brazen Borrower provides additional disruption, while Kor Spiritdancer and Invisible Stalker are your key creatures that can grow in power and evade blockers."

By using mana acceleration cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Elvish Spirit Guide, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with threats such as Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Oko, Thief of Crowns. The deck also includes protection in the form of Force of Will, Misdirection, and Mystical Dispute to ensure the combo goes off smoothly. With a mix of disruption and aggressive plays, the deck aims to control the game and win through its powerful combos."
