Cards like Luminarch Aspirant and Halvar, God of Battle help buff up the creatures, while Selfless Savior and Alseid of Life's Bounty provide protection. Skyclave Apparition can deal with opposing threats, while Faceless Haven and Castle Ardenvale offer additional sources of creatures. The strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of weenies that can quickly close out the game."
