By efficiently utilizing the graveyard and hand disruption cards like Thoughtseize, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining a steady stream of threats on the battlefield. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Rankle, Master of Pranks provides the deck with additional ways to pressure the opponent and generate card advantage. The deck's mana base is streamlined to support a consistent flow of black mana for casting spells and activating abilities."
