The deck also includes creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear to apply early pressure. Additionally, cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Sulfuric Vortex punish the opponent for playing spells by dealing damage. Cards like Roiling Vortex and Wheel of Misfortune provide additional burn and disruption options. The deck mainly focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with consistent and high-damage burn spells."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly deal damage to the opponent through a combination of fast and efficient burn spells, while also applying pressure with early creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear. The deck aims to end the game as quickly as possible, leveraging cards like Fireblast and Price of Progress to finish off opponents in the later stages of the game. The inclusion of Pyrostatic Pillar and Roiling Vortex helps to disrupt opponents' game plans and ensure that the focus remains on dealing damage."
