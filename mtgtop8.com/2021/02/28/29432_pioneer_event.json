With a low mana curve and a focus on powerful creatures like Rankle, Master of Pranks and Knight of the Ebon Legion, the deck aims to quickly apply pressure and close out the game before the opponent can establish their own strategy. The inclusion of utility lands like Castle Locthwain and Mutavault helps to provide additional advantages in longer games."
