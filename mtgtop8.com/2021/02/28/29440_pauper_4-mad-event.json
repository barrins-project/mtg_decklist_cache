It utilizes flicker effects and creature recursion to outvalue the opponent, while also ramping with Cloudpost and Glimmerpost to cast powerful spells like Peregrine Drake and Mulldrifter. The deck aims to disrupt opponents with removal and counter magic, while also having access to utility lands and tools like Crop Rotation for flexibility in different matchups. Ultimately, the deck aims to grind out opponents with its efficient card draw and recursion engine."
