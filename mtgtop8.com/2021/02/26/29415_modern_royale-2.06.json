Additionally, the inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional recursion and consistency in bringing back important threats."

Eidolon of the Great Revel punishes opponents for casting spells, and cards like Skullcrack prevent them from gaining life or using life gain effects. The mana base is focused on producing red mana efficiently to allow for quick plays and aggressive starts. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, consistent damage output."
