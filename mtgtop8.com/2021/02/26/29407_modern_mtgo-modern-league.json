By playing small, evasive creatures like Blighted Agent and Glistener Elf, along with pump spells like Scale Up and Might of Old Krosa, the goal is to deal 10 poison counters to the opponent. Protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense help keep your creatures safe, while disruption cards like Spell Pierce can help ensure your combos go off without a hitch. The key strategy is to quickly build up your infect count and close out the game before the opponent can mount a defense."

The deck has a low curve to apply pressure early and uses cards like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to control the board. The inclusion of Temur Battle Rage allows for explosive turns and the flexibility to close out games quickly. Overall, the deck aims to be aggressive and disruptive, maintaining tempo while threatening the opponent's life total."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to create powerful, hexproof creatures by attaching multiple aura spells to them, making them difficult for the opponent to deal with. The deck focuses on quickly building up strong, evasive threats like Gladecover Scout, Kor Spiritdancer, and Slippery Bogle, which can quickly close out the game. By utilizing cards like Daybreak Coronet, Ethereal Armor, Rancor, and other auras, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a lethal combination of protection and aggression. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds an extra layer of versatility and recursion to the deck."
