It utilizes cards like Tergrid, God of Fright and Soul Shatter to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain board control. The deck also includes win conditions like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Faceless Haven to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent, eventually overwhelming them with its powerful late-game threats."
