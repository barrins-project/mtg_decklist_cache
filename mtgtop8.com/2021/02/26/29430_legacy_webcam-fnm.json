The key concept of the deck is to control the game by using counterspells, discard spells, and removal to disrupt the opponent's strategy while generating card advantage through cantrips and card draw. The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Time Raveler, along with resilient threats like Monastery Mentor and Baleful Strix to close out the game. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistency in casting spells."
