The deck aims to stall out the game until it can reach its powerful late-game threats, such as Emergent Ultimatum or Alrund's Epiphany, to take over the game and secure victory. The deck also utilizes the companion Yorion, Sky Nomad for additional value and flexibility. Overall, the strategy of this deck is to maintain control of the game and overwhelm the opponent with powerful plays."
