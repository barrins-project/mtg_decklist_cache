            "notes": "The main idea of this Rakdos Aggro deck is to disrupt your opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, while also putting pressure on them with efficient creatures like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Seasoned Pyromancer. The deck also utilizes powerful removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to control the board, along with Blood Moon to disrupt multicolor decks. Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and card advantage, while Magmatic Channeler and Dark Confidant help with card selection and card advantage. The mana base is streamlined to support the aggressive game plan."
