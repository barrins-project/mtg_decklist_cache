Utilizing mana acceleration from cards like Priest of Titania and Birchlore Rangers, it aims to flood the board with creatures like Lys Alana Huntmaster and Timberwatch Elf to buff each other and deal massive damage. Distant Melody and Lead the Stampede help refill the hand and continue to generate threats. Wellwisher provides some lifegain to help sustain against aggressive opponents. Overall, the strategy revolves around quickly establishing a strong board presence and leveraging the tribal synergy of elves."
