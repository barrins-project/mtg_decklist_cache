The deck contains card draw and search spells like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Cunning Wish to find key combo pieces quickly. Once Omniscience is in play, the deck can cast spells for free, allowing for explosive turns and overwhelming board presence. The main goal is to quickly assemble the combo pieces and win the game in a single turn."

The deck includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Misdirection to protect the combo pieces, while also having disruptive planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns. The mana base is set up to support the multiple colors needed for the deck, with a mix of fetch lands and dual lands. Overall, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
