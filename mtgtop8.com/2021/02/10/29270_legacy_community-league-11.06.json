It also has tools for disruption with cards like Wasteland, Rishadan Port, and Punishing Fire, making it difficult for the opponent to develop their game plan while the deck builds up its own win condition."

The deck also relies on fast mana sources like Ancient Tomb and Lotus Petal, as well as disruption in the form of counter spells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect its game-winning combo. Overall, the deck focuses on explosiveness and high impact plays."
