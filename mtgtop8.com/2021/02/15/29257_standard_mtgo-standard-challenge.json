The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value by blinking permanents for extra triggers.

The goal is to outvalue the opponent by generating card advantage and resolving big threats like Vorinclex and Alrund's Epiphany. The mana base is carefully crafted to ensure consistency in casting spells across all colors."

The key strategy revolves around stalling the game with counter spells and removal until the late game, where cards like Yorion and Shark Typhoon can generate significant card advantage and threats. The deck also aims to gain incremental advantages through cards like Archon of Sun's Grace and Elspeth Conquers Death. Overall, the deck aims to play a slower, more controlling game plan with inevitability in the late game."
