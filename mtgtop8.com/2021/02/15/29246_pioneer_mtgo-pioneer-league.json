The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of aggressive creatures and powerful planeswalkers like Nissa and Vivien. The key strategy revolves around generating as much mana as possible to play big threats like Voracious Hydra and Vorinclex, Monstrous Raider. By maximizing devotion to green and utilizing efficient ramp, the deck seeks to establish a dominant board presence and close out games quickly."
