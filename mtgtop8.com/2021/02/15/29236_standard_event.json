By using cards like Thieves' Guild Enforcer and Ruin Crab to mill the opponent's deck, Soaring Thought-Thief to boost damage, and Drown in the Loch to counter spells or destroy creatures, the deck aims to slow down the opponent and ultimately outvalue them with cards like Into the Story and Lurrus of the Dream-Den. The deck also utilizes control elements like Essence Scatter and Heartless Act to maintain board presence and disrupt the opponent's strategy."
