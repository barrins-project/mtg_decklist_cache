The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional recursion of auras from the graveyard, ensuring a steady stream of threats throughout the game. The key concept of this deck is to swarm the opponent with efficiently buffed creatures to quickly secure victory."

By quickly ramping up mana with mana dorks like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic, the deck aims to play big threats like Ghalta, Primal Hunger and Questing Beast early in the game. Rhonas the Indomitable and Surrak, the Hunt Caller also provide good combat tricks and pump effects for the creatures. The deck utilizes Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Hashep Oasis to generate even more mana and activate abilities."
