The deck also includes a mix of burn spells and creatures with powerful enters-the-battlefield effects to maintain board control and pressure the opponent. By carefully managing resources and controlling the tempo of the game, the Izzet Control deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent to secure victory."
