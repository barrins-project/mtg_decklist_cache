The deck utilizes a combination of cantrips like Preordain and Ponder to dig for threats and disruption, while also running a suite of counterspells like Force of Will and Daze to protect its threats. Wasteland is included to disrupt the opponent's mana base, while cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns provide additional utility and disruption. Overall, the deck aims to maintain control of the game while clocking the opponent with aggressive creatures."
