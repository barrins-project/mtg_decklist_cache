Support cards like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell further boost the damage output of the deck. The inclusion of snow lands allows for the use of Frost Bite and Faceless Haven to control the board and deal additional damage. The goal is to quickly deplete the opponent's life total before they have a chance to stabilize, ultimately leading to a swift victory."
