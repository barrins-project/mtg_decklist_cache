The inclusion of Riddleform allows for additional damage potential and card advantage. Goldspan Dragon provides a powerful late-game threat, while Brazen Borrower and Bonecrusher Giant offer versatile removal options."

By playing efficient threats like Brushfire Elemental and Questing Beast early on, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent and close out the game quickly with cards like Embercleave and The Great Henge. The deck also includes cards like Scavenging Ooze and Fire Prophecy to disrupt the opponent's strategy and keep the pressure on. With a strong mana base and a focus on tempo, this deck aims to win through sheer aggression and efficiency."
