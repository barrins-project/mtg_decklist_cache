By playing low mana cost creatures like Nettle Sentinel and Burning-Tree Emissary, and buffing them with cards like Elephant Guide and Rancor, the deck aims to deal damage efficiently and consistently. Cards like Savage Swipe and Vines of Vastwood are included for removal and protection, while cards like Hunger of the Howlpack provide additional buffs for the creatures. The strategy is to swarm the battlefield with creatures and push for early damage to secure victory."
