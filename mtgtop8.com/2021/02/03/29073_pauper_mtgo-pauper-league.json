Crop Rotation and Ancient Stirrings help to find key lands and cards, while Pulse of Murasa helps to recover creatures from the graveyard.

By combining removal spells like Chainer's Edict and Disfigure with lifegain from Pristine Talisman and Kabira Crossroads, this deck aims to stall out opponents and eventually win through attrition. The use of Bonder's Ornament also helps to ensure consistent card draw to maintain control over the game."
