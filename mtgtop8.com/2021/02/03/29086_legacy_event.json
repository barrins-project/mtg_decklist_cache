The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Wasteland and Lightning Bolt, while also generating card advantage with Dreadhorde Arcanist. The inclusion of Oko, Thief of Crowns provides additional disruption and versatility to the deck. Overall, the deck seeks to maintain pressure and tempo while disrupting the opponent's strategy to secure a victory."
