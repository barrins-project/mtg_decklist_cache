This combo-oriented strategy aims to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures early in the game, putting them on the back foot and allowing for a quick victory. The Deck also includes disruptive cards like Chancellor of the Annex and Thoughtseize to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
