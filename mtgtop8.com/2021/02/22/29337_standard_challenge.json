By cycling through cards like Flourishing Fox and Drannith Stinger, players can trigger abilities and pump up their creatures for big attacks. The deck also includes powerful spells like Zenith Flare to finish off opponents. Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a versatile companion that can be used for recursion and additional value throughout the game."
