The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with massive creatures before they have a chance to respond, leading to a quick victory."

It utilizes a combination of cantrips, rituals, and tutors to generate storm count and find key combo pieces, while also including disruption in the form of discard spells and counters to protect the combo. The deck aims to win the game in a single explosive turn, making it a high-risk, high-reward strategy."
