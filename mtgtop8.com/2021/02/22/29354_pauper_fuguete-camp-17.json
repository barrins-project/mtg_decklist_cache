The deck also includes card draw options like Ichor Wellspring, Witching Well, and Prophetic Prism to ensure consistent resources. Additionally, removal spells like Journey to Nowhere and burn spells like Galvanic Blast help control the board and finish off opponents. The mana base consists of artifact lands like Seat of the Synod and Ancient Den, along with support from other mana fixers like Chromatic Star and Great Furnace. Thoughtcast and Of One Mind provide further card advantage to keep up the pressure."
