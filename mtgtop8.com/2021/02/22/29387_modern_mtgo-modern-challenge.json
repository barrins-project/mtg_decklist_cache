This deck aims to generate a lot of value from the graveyard, while also being able to deal damage with cards like Creeping Chill and Conflagrate. The key strategy is to consistently dredge cards into the graveyard and abuse the graveyard recursion to overwhelm the opponent."

The use of Wrenn and Six adds additional card advantage and Brazen Borrower offers versatility in dealing with threats. Overall, the deck seeks to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents for a decisive victory."
