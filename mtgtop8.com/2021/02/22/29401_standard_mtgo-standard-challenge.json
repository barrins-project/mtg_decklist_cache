By constantly applying pressure and dealing damage to the opponent's life total, the deck aims to finish the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize. Cards like Anax, Hardened in the Forge, Bonecrusher Giant, and Embercleave are all key pieces in executing this game plan. The inclusion of snow lands and Faceless Haven provides additional versatility and resilience to the deck's aggressive strategy."
