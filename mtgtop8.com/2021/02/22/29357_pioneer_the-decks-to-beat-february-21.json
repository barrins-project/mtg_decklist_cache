By combining flying creatures and tribal buffs, it aims to pressure the opponent early in the game while also providing disruption through counter spells and flash creatures. The mana base supports the aggressive game plan by allowing for consistent casting of creatures and spells. Overall, the deck aims to establish control of the game and close out matches before the opponent can stabilize."
