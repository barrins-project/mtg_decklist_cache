By utilizing cards like The Great Henge and Trail of Crumbs, the deck aims to quickly ramp up mana and draw cards, allowing for explosive plays. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion provides additional value and flexibility in the late game. With a mix of aggressive threats like Questing Beast and Feasting Troll King, along with efficient removal options, this Sultai Aggro deck is designed to apply constant pressure and maintain a strong board presence throughout the game."
