By utilizing cards like Thoughtseize and Thought Erasure to disrupt the opponent's game plan, along with removal spells like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay to deal with threats, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent. The deck also utilizes powerful multicolored cards like Niv-Mizzet Reborn and Bring to Light to create card advantage and provide versatile answers to different board states. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for extra value and flexibility in longer games."

            "notes": "This Jund aggro deck focuses on quickly ramping up mana and flooding the board with creatures that generate value when sacrificed. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creature aggro and sacrificing mechanisms, while utilizing cards like Bolas's Citadel and Collected Company for additional advantage. By combining ramp, sacrifice, and direct damage effects, this deck aims to create a fast and aggressive win condition against opponents in the Pioneer 1 vs 1 format."
