It aims to outvalue opponents by playing powerful spells like Emergent Ultimatum and Alrund's Epiphany to gain card advantage and generate powerful board presence. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for extra value by blinking permanents for additional triggers. With a mix of removal, counterspells, and powerful late-game threats, the deck aims to outlast opponents and win through incremental advantage."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on flooding the board with small, cheap creatures and quickly buffing them up with equipment to overwhelm the opponent. It utilizes cards like Alseid of Life's Bounty and Selfless Savior for protection, while also running disruptive cards like Skyclave Apparition to deal with threats. The deck also makes use of snow lands and Faceless Haven for additional creature threats. The goal is to maintain a steady stream of attackers while also having some resilience against removal spells or board wipes."
