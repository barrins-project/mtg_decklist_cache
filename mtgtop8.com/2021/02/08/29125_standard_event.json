The deck focuses on using mill effects like Ruin Crab and Soaring Thought-Thief to slowly deplete the opponent's library, while also utilizing counterspells and removal spells to handle threats. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value from the graveyard. By controlling the board and card advantage, this deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
