Pulse of Murasa helps gain life and return key cards from the graveyard, while Bonder's Ornament and Prophetic Prism help fix mana and draw cards.

By efficiently using enchantments like Ethereal Armor, Abundant Growth, and Ancestral Mask, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and aggressive strategy. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Slippery Bogle and Silhana Ledgewalker to ensure the auras stick on the creature and can't be easily removed."
