The key strategy is to quickly establish a board presence with efficient creatures like Goldspan Dragon and Lovestruck Beast, while disrupting the opponent's game plan with versatile cards like Bonecrusher Giant and Brazen Borrower. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion adds an extra layer of aggression, allowing for increased damage output. The deck aims to close out games quickly by overwhelming the opponent with relentless pressure."
