The deck aims to control the board through cards like Force of Will and Dack Fayden, while also generating card advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. By efficiently removing threats and denying the opponent resources, the deck can take over the game and secure victory through attrition and card advantage. Additionally, the deck utilizes powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to close out the game."
