By using cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Elvish Mystic to accelerate mana production and cards like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Vivien, Arkbow Ranger to pump up devotion, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with big threats like Voracious Hydra. Karn, the Great Creator adds utility and disruption to the mix, while Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx can generate a huge amount of mana to further enable explosive plays."
