            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to put pressure on the opponent quickly with aggressive creatures like Skyclave Shade, Bonecrusher Giant, and Goldspan Dragon. Utilizing cards like Rankle, Master of Pranks and Valki, God of Lies to disrupt the opponent's strategy while also utilizing Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Egon, God of Death to punish the opponent's hand and graveyard. Removal spells like Heartless Act and Shatterskull Smashing help control the board while Tymaret Calls the Dead provides card advantage. Liliana, Waker of the Dead supports the aggressive strategy with graveyard recursion. The mana base is consistent with a mix of swamps, mountains, and dual lands to ensure smooth gameplay."
