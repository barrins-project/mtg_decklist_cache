By leveraging cards like Luminarch Aspirant and Speaker of the Heavens, it aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and consistent stream of attackers. The inclusion of cards like Skyclave Apparition and Reidane, God of the Worthy provide disruption and control elements to maintain pressure on the opponent while protecting your own board. Finally, utility cards like Maul of the Skyclaves and Fight as One provide additional combat tricks and enhancements to push for lethal damage."
