The deck aims to generate card advantage with cards like Behold the Multiverse and Shark Typhoon, while also pressuring the opponent with versatile threats such as Brazen Borrower, Bonecrusher Giant, and Goldspan Dragon. By efficiently managing resources and disrupting the opponent's game plan, this deck looks to grind out incremental advantages and eventually overwhelm the opponent to secure victory."
