            "notes": "This deck aims to control the game by utilizing powerful planeswalkers and disruptive spells, while also being able to put pressure on the opponent with efficient threats like True-Name Nemesis and Stoneforge Mystic. The inclusion of countermagic like Force of Will and Force of Negation ensures that the opponent's key spells can be countered, while cards like Teferi, Time Raveler can shut down their interaction. By combining control elements with Stoneblade creatures and equipment, this deck seeks to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
