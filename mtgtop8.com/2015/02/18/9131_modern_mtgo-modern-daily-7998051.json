The goal is to chain together multiple spells in a turn to generate a large storm count, enabling cards like Grapeshot to deal lethal damage to the opponent. With the help of Goblin Electromancer and Past in Flames, the deck is able to recur key spells from the graveyard to keep the combo going and overwhelm the opponent before they can respond."
