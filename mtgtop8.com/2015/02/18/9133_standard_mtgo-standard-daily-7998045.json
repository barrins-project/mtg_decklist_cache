By using pump spells like Titan's Strength and Temur Battle Rage, as well as burn spells like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames, this deck can deal a lot of damage quickly. The combination of low-cost creatures and pump spells allows for explosive plays and can quickly end the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of Hall of Triumph boosts the power of all creatures in the deck."
