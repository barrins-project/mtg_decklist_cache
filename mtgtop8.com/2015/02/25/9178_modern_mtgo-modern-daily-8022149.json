            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by countering and removing opponent's threats, while also generating card advantage and board presence. This is achieved through a mix of efficient removal spells like Path to Exile and Supreme Verdict, counterspells like Remand and Spell Snare, and versatile planeswalkers like Gideon Jura and Jace, Architect of Thought. The deck also has access to card draw and land destruction to outvalue and outpace the opponent in the late game. The mana base is optimized for consistent access to all colors of mana."
