The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan, while also drawing cards and generating card advantage through spells like Dig Through Time and Jace's Ingenuity. The deck also includes board wipes like Crux of Fate and Perilous Vault to deal with problematic creatures on the board. Overall, the key strategy is to outlast the opponent and win through attrition and value."
