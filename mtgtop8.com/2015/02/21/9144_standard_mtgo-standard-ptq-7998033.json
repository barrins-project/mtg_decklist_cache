With cards like Dissolve, Hero's Downfall, and Thoughtseize, the player can disrupt their opponent's strategy while efficiently dealing with threats on the board. Dig Through Time provides additional card advantage and selection, while powerful finishers such as Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver can quickly close out the game. The inclusion of Perilous Vault and Crux of Fate also ensures the player has answers to a wide range of threats."
