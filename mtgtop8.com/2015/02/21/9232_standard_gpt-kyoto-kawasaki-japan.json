The goal is to establish early board presence and apply pressure to the opponent while constantly dealing damage to their life total. The creatures have varying abilities that can help control the board and protect themselves, while the burn spells provide direct damage to finish off opponents or remove threats. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its fast-paced gameplay and versatility in both creatures and spells."
