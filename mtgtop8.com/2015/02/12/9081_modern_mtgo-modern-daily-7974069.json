By utilizing fast-paced aggression with a low mana curve, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize or mount a defense. The inclusion of cards like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Guide, and Eidolon of the Great Revel further enhances the deck's aggressive strategy, while cards like Lightning Bolt, Searing Blaze, and Lava Spike help to finish off the opponent quickly."
