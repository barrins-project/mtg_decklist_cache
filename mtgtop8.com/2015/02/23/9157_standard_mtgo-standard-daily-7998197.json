            "notes": "The deck revolves around using a combination of removal spells, counterspells, and card draw to control the game and manipulate the opponent's resources. It focuses on setting up a defensive board state with cards like Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, while using cards like Dissolve and Disdainful Stroke to prevent the opponent from resolving key threats. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by efficiently answering threats and generating card advantage with spells like Dig Through Time and Jace's Ingenuity, ultimately leading to a victory through attrition."
