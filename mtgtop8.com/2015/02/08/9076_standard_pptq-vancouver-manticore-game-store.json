The goal is to trigger the heroic ability on these creatures, making them bigger and harder to deal with, while also using cards like Temur Battle Rage and Aqueous Form to push through damage and close out the game quickly. The deck also includes Ordeal of Thassa and Ordeal of Heliod to provide additional card draw and life gain."

By using cards like Thoughtseize and Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver to disrupt your opponent's hand, along with removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Bile Blight to deal with threats on the board, the deck aims to control the game until it can establish a dominant position with powerful planeswalkers like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Garruk, Apex Predator. The deck also utilizes card advantage and deck manipulation with cards like Dig Through Time and Satyr Wayfinder to ensure it has the resources it needs to continue controlling the game."
