With a mix of hand disruption, creature removal, and resilient threats like Tarmogoyf and Siege Rhino, the deck can handle a variety of threats while applying consistent pressure. The inclusion of Liliana of the Veil adds another layer of disruption, making it difficult for opponents to develop their game plan. Lingering Souls provides additional value and resilience against removal, allowing the deck to maintain a strong board presence throughout the game."

Ensnaring Bridge helps to protect the player from creature-heavy strategies, while Planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil provide additional disruption and control options."
