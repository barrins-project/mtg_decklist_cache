It also includes cards like Dig Through Time and Jace's Ingenuity to draw cards and maintain card advantage. The deck includes powerful finishers like Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to close out the game once it has gained control. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency and flexibility in casting spells."
