By using cards like Faithless Looting and Breakthrough to discard cards and trigger Dredge abilities, the player can easily bring back creatures like Ichorid and Narcomoeba from the graveyard. This deck also includes cards like Bridge from Below and Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's strategy while fueling its own graveyard recursion engine. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures and win through aggressive attacks or combo finishes with cards like Dread Return and Flame-Kin Zealot."

The deck aims to quickly ramp up mana with cards like Heritage Druid and Gaea's Cradle, while utilizing Glimpse of Nature and Elvish Visionary to draw through the deck rapidly. Once a critical mass of Elves is on the board, the deck can win through a combo involving Craterhoof Behemoth or Natural Order. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast mana and explosive plays."

The key strategy is to utilize cards like Dark Ritual, Lotus Petal, and Lion's Eye Diamond to ramp up mana production, while using cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder to dig for combo pieces. This allows the player to eventually cast high-impact spells such as Ad Nauseam or Tendrils of Agony, resulting in a lethal storm finish. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Cabal Therapy and Duress to disrupt opponents' game plans."
