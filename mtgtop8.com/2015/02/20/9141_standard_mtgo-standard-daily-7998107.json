The key strategy is to accelerate mana production and overwhelm opponents with big creatures and strong board presence. It employs a mix of ramp, control, and aggression to outpace and outvalue opponents in a Standard 1 vs 1 format."

It also includes planeswalkers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon for additional value and board presence. The deck aims to apply early pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan through hand disruption and removal spells, while also having a strong late game with powerful threats and card advantage engines. The mana base is built to support the three-color combination of black, green, and white effectively."
