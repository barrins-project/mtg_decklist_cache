By utilizing cards like Steel Overseer and Arcbound Ravager, along with Cranial Plating and Ensoul Artifact, it aims to overwhelm opponents with a high-powered army of creatures. The mana base of Darksteel Citadel, Blinkmoth Nexus, and Inkmoth Nexus enables fast and consistent mana production, while Galvanic Blast provides additional reach for closing out the game. This Aggro-Affinity deck excels at applying pressure early and maintaining it throughout the match."

The main strategy is to pressure the opponent early and punish them with a mix of direct damage and tempo plays, all while disrupting their game plan with counter spells and removal. The inclusion of Blood Moon can also be a powerful hate card against certain decks."

Aiding in this strategy are creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, which can attack early and put pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes spells like Skullcrack to prevent life gain from the opponent and Eidolon of the Great Revel to punish them for playing spells. The mana base is optimized for casting these spells efficiently and consistently."
