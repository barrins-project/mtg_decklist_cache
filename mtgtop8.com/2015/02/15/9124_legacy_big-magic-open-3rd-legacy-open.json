The deck also utilizes the Counterbalance and Jace, the Mind Sculptor combo for further control and card advantage. The win condition is to control the board with removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and finish the game with Entreat the Angels. The land base includes utility lands like Karakas and Dust Bowl for additional control."
