This allows for explosive plays with high mana cost threats like Whisperwood Elemental and Polukranos, World Eater. The deck also includes removal in the form of Crater's Claws and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon for board control. Overall, the strategy revolves around efficiently ramping up mana and controlling the game until the player can overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
