            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game through a combination of counterspells, removal, and planeswalkers. It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by countering key spells, destroying creatures, and generating card advantage with cards like Dig Through Time. The planeswalkers, such as Ashiok and Garruk, provide additional threats and card advantage. The mana base supports the deck's three-color requirements and includes cards that help fix mana like Opulent Palace and Polluted Delta. Overall, the deck's goal is to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent to secure victory."
