            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressively dealing direct damage to the opponent through efficient burn spells and fast creatures. The key strategy is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total by consistently casting cheap spells and attacking with hasty creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Guide, and Vexing Devil. By maintaining pressure and preventing the opponent from stabilizing, the deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can establish a strong defense or gain enough life to withstand the onslaught of burn spells."
