The deck aims to apply pressure from the early game with efficient threats like Fleecemane Lion and Rakshasa Deathdealer, and to finish off the opponent with impactful cards like Siege Rhino and Wingmate Roc. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Sorin, Solemn Visitor provides additional value and resilience. Additionally, the mana base is optimized to ensure smooth and consistent casting of spells throughout the game."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Thoughtseize and Bile Blight, while also utilizing ramp spells like Sylvan Caryatid and Courser of Kruphix to accelerate into threats like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The deck also includes graveyard recursion with Tasigur, the Golden Fang and utilizes powerful board wipes like Crux of Fate to maintain board control. Ultimately, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and secure victory through overwhelming card advantage and powerful threats."
