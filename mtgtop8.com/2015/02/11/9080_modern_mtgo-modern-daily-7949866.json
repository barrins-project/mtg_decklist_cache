Spreading Seas disrupts the opponent's mana base and draws cards, while Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment. The deck also includes disruption with Cursecatcher and interaction with Dismember and Relic of Progenitus. Overall, the key strategy of this deck is to flood the board with Merfolk creatures, utilize tribal synergies, and control the game with tempo plays."

The inclusion of Wild Defiance can help against removal spells and increase the power of your pump spells. The deck is focused on achieving a quick win through infect damage."
