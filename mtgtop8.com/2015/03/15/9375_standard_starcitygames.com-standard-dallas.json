The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Abzan Charm, while generating card advantage with cards like Read the Bones. The deck also has powerful finishers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to close out games. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color strategy with a mix of dual lands and mana-fixing lands."

The inclusion of cards like Whip of Erebos and Hornet Queen provide additional sources of recursion and token generation, giving the deck multiple avenues to close out games quickly through aggressive plays and attrition."

The deck also includes powerful spells like Stoke the Flames and Dig Through Time to close out games quickly. Jeskai Charm and Valorous Stance provide flexibility in dealing with threats, while cards like Soulfire Grand Master and Seeker of the Way provide additional lifegain and resilience. Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker adds a powerful finisher to the deck."
