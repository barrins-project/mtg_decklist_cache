            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly apply pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan through counterspells and removal. By utilizing efficient creatures like Delver of Secrets and Stoneforge Mystic to apply pressure, along with powerful spells like Brainstorm and Force of Will to control the game, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent can establish their own strategy. Additionally, tools like Swords to Plowshares and Umezawa's Jitte can help remove threats and swing the game in your favor."
