The goal is to maintain pressure and end the game before the opponent can stabilize."

By using cards like Lightning Strike, Stoke the Flames, and Outpost Siege along with powerful creatures like Mantis Rider and Goblin Rabblemaster, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. Additionally, the inclusion of Soulfire Grand Master provides longevity and recursion for the deck's spells."
