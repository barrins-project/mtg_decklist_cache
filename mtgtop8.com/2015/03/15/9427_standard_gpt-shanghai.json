The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly by utilizing aggressive creatures and pumping them up with cards like Chief of the Edge and Brutal Hordechief. Athreos, God of Passage provides additional value by potentially returning creatures from the graveyard, further disrupting the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of disruptive spells like Crippling Blight also helps to maintain the tempo of the game in your favor."
