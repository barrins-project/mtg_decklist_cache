The deck also has a strong removal package with cards like Abrupt Decay and Path to Exile, as well as a token generation engine with Lingering Souls. The mana base is designed to support the three-color strategy of Abzan while also providing flexibility in casting spells. The goal of the deck is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient threats and disruption."
