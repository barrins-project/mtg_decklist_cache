Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum help ramp up mana for explosive turns, while Thoughtcast and Galvanic Blast provide card advantage and removal. The deck's key strategy is to overwhelm opponents with a flurry of cheap, efficient threats and utilize synergy between artifacts to quickly close out games."
