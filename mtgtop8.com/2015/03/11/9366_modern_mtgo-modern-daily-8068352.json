By utilizing cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to accelerate mana production, the deck can quickly deploy threats like Arcbound Ravager and Cranial Plating. Steel Overseer provides a way to pump up the team, while Vault Skirge and Etched Champion offer resilience. With an aggressive game plan and the ability to adapt to various situations, this Affinity deck aims to close out games as efficiently as possible."
