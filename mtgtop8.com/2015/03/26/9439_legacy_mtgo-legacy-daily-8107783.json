The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent with cards like Wasteland and Stifle, while also utilizing card advantage and tempo with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Delver of Secrets. The deck aims to control the board with efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Force of Will, while also generating tokens with Young Pyromancer and gaining value with Deathrite Shaman. Tasigur, the Golden Fang and True-Name Nemesis provide additional threats and card advantage."
