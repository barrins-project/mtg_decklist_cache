The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent with early creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Seeker of the Way, while also providing reach and removal with cards like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames. The inclusion of powerful threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Brimaz, King of Oreskos ensures that the deck can finish the game quickly if the opponent is unable to stabilize. The deck also includes cards like Outpost Siege to provide card advantage in longer games."
