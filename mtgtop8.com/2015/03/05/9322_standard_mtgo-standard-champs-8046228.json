            "notes": "The main concept of this Gruul Aggro deck is to quickly establish a strong board presence using efficient creatures and powerful spells to deal damage to the opponent as quickly as possible. Cards like Courser of Kruphix and Sylvan Caryatid help ramp up mana while providing extra value, while creatures like Stormbreath Dragon, Ashcloud Phoenix, and Hornet Queen can deal significant damage and provide a threat that is difficult for opponents to deal with. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Strike and Crater's Claws to control the board and clear the way for attacking."
