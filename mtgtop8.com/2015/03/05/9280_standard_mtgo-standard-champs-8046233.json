By flooding the board with creatures like Tormented Hero, Mardu Shadowspear, and Bloodsoaked Champion, players can leverage the power of Obelisk of Urd to boost their team's strength. Removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Bile Blight help clear the way for attacks, while cards like Mogis's Marauder and Mardu Strike Leader provide additional utility and ways to close out games efficiently. This Mono Black Aggro deck aims to win through swift, relentless pressure."
