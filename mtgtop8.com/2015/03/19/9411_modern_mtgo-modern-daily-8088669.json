By utilizing cards like Lightning Bolt, Terminate, Abrupt Decay, and Liliana of the Veil, the deck aims to control the board while deploying threats like Dark Confidant, Tarmogoyf, and Scavenging Ooze to close out the game quickly. The inclusion of hand disruption spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize helps the deck disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain tempo. Additionally, the deck has versatile threats like Olivia Voldaren and Huntmaster of the Fells to handle various situations."
