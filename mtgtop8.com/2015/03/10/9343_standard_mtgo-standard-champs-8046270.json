By consistently applying pressure early in the game with cheap, high-impact creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Rabblemaster, backed up by burn spells like Wild Slash and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. The key is to maintain a relentless pace and not let the opponent stabilize, ensuring victory through sheer speed and aggression."
