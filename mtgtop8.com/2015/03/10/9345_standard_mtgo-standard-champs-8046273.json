By playing creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster, Mantis Rider, and Seeker of the Way, along with burn spells like Wild Slash and Lightning Strike, the deck can apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game. The addition of cards like Dig Through Time and Outpost Siege allows the deck to dig for more threats or answers while keeping the pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to win through a combination of creature damage and burn spells before the opponent can stabilize."
