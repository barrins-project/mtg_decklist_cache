By combining powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Liliana of the Veil with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Terminate, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and win through aggressive creature attacks. The use of hand disruption spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize also helps to disrupt the opponent's strategy, making it difficult for them to establish a board presence. Overall, the deck aims to win quickly through a combination of efficient threats and disruption."

This is achieved through cards like Thoughtseize, Abrupt Decay, and Cryptic Command to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Snapcaster Mage and Serum Visions provide card advantage. Tasigur and Thragtusk provide a threat that can stabilize the board, while Tarmogoyf acts as a powerful finisher. The mana base is designed to support the three-color combination of black, blue, and green efficiently."

The deck then uses powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine, Sundering Titan, Platinum Angel, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Karn Liberated to win the game. It also utilizes card draw with Thirst for Knowledge and tutors with Treasure Mage to find the necessary pieces. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can play its high-impact threats to secure victory."
