It focuses on dealing damage as quickly as possible, using cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Foundry Street Denizen to build up damage, while also using burn spells like Stoke the Flames and Searing Blood to clear the way for your creatures. The goal is to apply constant pressure on the opponent, forcing them to react defensively and allowing you to quickly close out the game."
