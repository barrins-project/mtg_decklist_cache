With cards like Hordeling Outburst and Goblin Rabblemaster to swarm the board, combined with direct damage spells like Wild Slash and Stoke the Flames, this deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game. Soulfire Grand Master provides added value by allowing you to recur burn spells from your graveyard, while cards like Seeker of the Way help to gain life and maintain tempo."
