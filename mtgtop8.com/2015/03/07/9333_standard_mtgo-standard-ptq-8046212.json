By using cards like Dissolve, Hero's Downfall, and Thoughtseize, the deck aims to maintain board control and prevent the opponent from executing their game plan. Additionally, the deck includes powerful finishers like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Pearl Lake Ancient to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. The deck also focuses on card advantage with cards like Dig Through Time and Jace's Ingenuity to help maintain control throughout the game."
