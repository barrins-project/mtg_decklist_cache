It utilizes mana acceleration from cards like Sylvan Caryatid and Courser of Kruphix to quickly play powerful threats such as Siege Rhino and Hornet Queen. The deck also includes disruption with cards like Hero's Downfall and Murderous Cut to clear the way for its creatures to attack. The inclusion of Whip of Erebos provides additional reach and resilience, allowing the deck to outlast opponents in longer games. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a steady stream of threats while maintaining control of the battlefield."
