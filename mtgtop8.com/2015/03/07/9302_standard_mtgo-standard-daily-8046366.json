By keeping a low mana curve and focusing on early game pressure, the deck aims to finish the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Key cards like Satyr Hoplite and Monastery Swiftspear provide strong early game threats, while burn spells like Stoke the Flames and Lightning Strike help to clear the way for attackers and finish off opponents."
