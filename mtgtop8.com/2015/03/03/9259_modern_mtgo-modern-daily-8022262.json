By giving them hexproof, the opponent is unable to target them with spells or abilities, making it difficult for them to deal with the threats on the board. The deck focuses on aggression and protection to secure victory."

It also aims to generate value through cards like Lingering Souls, Tarmogoyf, and Scavenging Ooze. The deck's powerful threats like Siege Rhino and Liliana of the Veil help close out games quickly while controlling the board. The mana base is designed to ensure smooth, consistent casting of spells while also providing access to all necessary colors."
