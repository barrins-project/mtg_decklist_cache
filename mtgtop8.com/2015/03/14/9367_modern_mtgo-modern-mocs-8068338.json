The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's multiple color requirements and includes utility lands like Gavony Township and Vault of the Archangel."

The deck also utilizes Snapcaster Mage to reuse key spells and can generate additional value from its lands with the Valakut triggers. By controlling the game and ramping up mana, this deck aims to quickly close out games with a massive burst of damage."
