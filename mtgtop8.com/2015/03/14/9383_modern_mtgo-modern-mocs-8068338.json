By discarding cards like Vengevine and Bloodghast, the deck aims to consistently bring back threats from the graveyard to overwhelm the opponent. With cards like Faithless Looting and Grisly Salvage, the deck can dig through its library to find the necessary pieces for its combo. The use of removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Murderous Cut help to deal with opposing threats, while also enabling the deck to continue its game plan of putting creatures into play from the graveyard."

Additionally, the deck has a strong threat in Wurmcoil Engine and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn for closing out the game.
