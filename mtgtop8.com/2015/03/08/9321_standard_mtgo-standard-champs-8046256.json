By playing low-cost creatures and burn spells, the goal is to deal as much damage as possible in the early turns of the game. Cards like Firedrinker Satyr, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Monastery Swiftspear help to apply constant pressure, while spells like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames provide additional reach to finish off the opponent. The deck's efficiency and speed make it a formidable force in a 1 vs 1 match."
