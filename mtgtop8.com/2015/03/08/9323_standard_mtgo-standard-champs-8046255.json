The deck aims to apply constant pressure, forcing your opponent to react defensively and ultimately win the game before they can stabilize. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Chandra and Sarkhan adds additional threats to the board, while Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx helps generate large amounts of mana for explosive plays."
