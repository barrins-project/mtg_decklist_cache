Key cards like Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith help to draw into important pieces of the combo, while Nettle Sentinel and Heritage Druid provide additional mana acceleration. With access to cards like Natural Order and Wirewood Symbiote, this deck can quickly assemble its combo to overwhelm opponents and win the game in a single explosive turn. The mix of creatures, mana producers, and card draw makes for a versatile and powerful strategy."
