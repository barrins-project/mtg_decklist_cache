It also includes cards like Mastery of the Unseen and Banishing Light for control. The key strategy is to generate a large amount of mana early in the game to overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures and maintain board control through removal spells. The deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and outvalue opponents through its efficient mana ramp and strong creature lineup."

Courser of Kruphix helps to control the top of the deck while Mastery of the Unseen provides a steady stream of creature tokens. Whisperwood Elemental adds resilience to the board. Banishing Light deals with troublesome permanents. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and control the game through mana ramp and creature generation."
