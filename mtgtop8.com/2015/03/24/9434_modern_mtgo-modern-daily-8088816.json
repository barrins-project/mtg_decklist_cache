The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive strategy while utilizing cards like Arcbound Ravager and Signal Pest for additional pressure. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Spellskite and Vault Skirge helps to protect your creatures and maintain board presence. The deck is designed to be fast-paced and punishing for opponents who can't keep up with its aggressive game plan."
