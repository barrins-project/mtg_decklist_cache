The key strategy is to efficiently use mana to deploy threats, clear the opponent's board, and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker and Citadel Siege provide additional reach and versatility, allowing the deck to adapt to different matchups and board states. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency and access to all the colors needed for the spells in the deck."
