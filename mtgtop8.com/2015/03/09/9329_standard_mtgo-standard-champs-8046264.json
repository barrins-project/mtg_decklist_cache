By utilizing cards like Firedrinker Satyr, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Monastery Swiftspear, along with burn spells like Wild Slash, Stoke the Flames, and Lightning Strike, the goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of Hordeling Outburst and Outpost Siege helps to maintain pressure and provide additional reach, ensuring the deck stays relentless in its assault."
