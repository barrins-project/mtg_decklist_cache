By utilizing cards like Firedrinker Satyr, Foundry Street Denizen, and Monastery Swiftspear early on, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent while also having access to spells like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames to finish them off. The overall strategy is to be fast-paced and relentless in pushing damage through to secure a victory."
