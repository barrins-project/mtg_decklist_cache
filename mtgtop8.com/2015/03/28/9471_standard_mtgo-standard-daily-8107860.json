These creatures provide both control and board presence, making it difficult for your opponent to overcome your advantage. The synergy between cards like Voyaging Satyr, Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx, and Genesis Hydra allows you to generate huge amounts of mana and play multiple threats in a single turn, putting pressure on your opponent and leading you to victory."
