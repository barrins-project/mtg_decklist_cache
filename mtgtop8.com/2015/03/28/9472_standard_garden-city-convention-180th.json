The key strategy is to generate a lot of mana through cards like Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Voyaging Satyr, allowing you to play big creatures early on and overwhelm your opponent. The inclusion of Temur Ascendancy also allows for card draw and haste, making your creatures even more dangerous."

By utilizing a mix of counterspells like Negate and Dissolve, removal spells like Bile Blight and Utter End, and card advantage engines like Dig Through Time and Dragonlord Ojutai, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and outvalue them in the late game. The win condition of the deck is to stabilize the board with powerful threats like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Dragonlord Ojutai to close out the game."
