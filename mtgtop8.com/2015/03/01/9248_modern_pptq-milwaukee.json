The key strategy is to maintain board control by countering opposing spells and removing threats, while using versatile creatures like Snapcaster Mage and Restoration Angel to generate additional value from instants and sorceries. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to all colors necessary for casting spells and activating creature abilities. The goal is to outlast opponents through a combination of disruption, removal, and card advantage."
