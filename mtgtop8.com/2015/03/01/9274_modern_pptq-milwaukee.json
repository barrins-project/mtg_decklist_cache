By using creatures with hexproof, the opponent will have a hard time targeting them with removal spells, allowing the player to create an unstoppable threat. The auras provide additional power and protection to the creature, making it difficult for the opponent to deal with. This aggressive strategy aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a strong defense, ultimately leading to a quick victory."
