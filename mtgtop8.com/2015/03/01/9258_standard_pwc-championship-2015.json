Jeskai Charm provides versatility with its multiple modes, and Valorous Stance offers protection for your creatures. The deck also includes some card draw and selection with Dig Through Time and Magma Jet. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure from the beginning and maintain control throughout the game."
