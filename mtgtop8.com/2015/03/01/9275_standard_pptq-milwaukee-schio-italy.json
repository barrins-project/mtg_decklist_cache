Seeker of the Way and Goblin Rabblemaster provide early pressure, while Brimaz, King of Oreskos and powerful dragons like Ashcloud Phoenix and Stormbreath Dragon offer a more threatening mid-to-late game presence. Chandra, Pyromaster and Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker provide additional damage and card advantage. Removal spells like Stoke the Flames and Lightning Strike help clear the way for attacks, while Chained to the Rocks deals with opposing threats. The deck aims to close out games swiftly before the opponent can stabilize."
