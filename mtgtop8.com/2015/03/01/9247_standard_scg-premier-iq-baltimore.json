The deck utilizes card draw spells like Jace's Ingenuity and Dig Through Time to help find key pieces and maintain card advantage. The win condition primarily revolves around powerful finishers like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Pearl Lake Ancient to close out the game once you have control of the board."
