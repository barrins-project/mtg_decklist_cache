The ultimate goal is to cast a huge Grapeshot spell to deal lethal damage to the opponent. Past in Flames allows for recursion of spells in the graveyard, while Faithless Looting helps filter through the deck. The deck aims to win by assembling the combo pieces and executing a massive storm turn to overwhelm the opponent."

The key strategy is to take advantage of synergies between artifacts, like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, while using efficient creatures like Signal Pest and Vault Skirge to apply constant pressure. The deck also includes disruption elements like Illness in the Ranks and Spellskite to disrupt the opponent's game plan, making it difficult for them to recover once the aggro strategy is in full swing."
