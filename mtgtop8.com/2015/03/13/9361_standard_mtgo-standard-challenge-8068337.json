The deck also includes card draw engines like Treasure Cruise to fuel its aggressive strategy, as well as protection spells like Gods Willing and Valorous Stance to protect key creatures and maintain pressure on the opponent. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient threats and versatile removal options."
