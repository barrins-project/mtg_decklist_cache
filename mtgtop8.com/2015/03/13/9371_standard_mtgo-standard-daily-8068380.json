These creatures are supported by burn spells like Lightning Strike and Wild Slash to clear the way for attacks. Outpost Siege provides card advantage and tempo, while cards like Valorous Stance and Stoke the Flames help control the board. The deck also includes some versatile threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Soulfire Grand Master for added pressure and resilience."

By playing aggressive creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Ashcloud Phoenix, along with powerful burn spells like Stoke the Flames and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and finish the game before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Soulfire Grand Master and Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker provide additional value and reach to close out games efficiently. The deck is designed to be fast and relentless in its attacks."
