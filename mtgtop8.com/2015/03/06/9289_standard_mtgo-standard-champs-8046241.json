The deck focuses on controlling the game by ramping up its mana, playing powerful creatures such as Polukranos, World Eater and Whisperwood Elemental, and using removal spells like Crater's Claws to deal with threats. The deck also includes cards like Genesis Hydra and Shamanic Revelation to provide card advantage and maintain its resources. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its efficient ramp and strong creature lineup."
