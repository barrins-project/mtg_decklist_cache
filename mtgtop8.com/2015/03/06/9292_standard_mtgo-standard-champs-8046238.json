Supporting spells such as Lightning Strike, Stoke the Flames, and Wild Slash provide additional damage and removal options. The inclusion of cards like Brimaz, King of Oreskos and Stormbreath Dragon adds resilience and versatility to the deck, allowing for different approaches to victory. Ultimately, the goal is to apply pressure early and maintain control of the board to secure a win."
