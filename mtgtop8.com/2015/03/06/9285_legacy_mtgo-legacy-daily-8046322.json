The deck includes a suite of countermagic like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect its combo pieces, while also utilizing cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder to help find the necessary pieces. Overall, the deck aims to quickly put the opponent on the back foot and win through a powerful combo."
