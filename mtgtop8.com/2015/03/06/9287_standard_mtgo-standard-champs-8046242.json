The deck aims to utilize cheap and efficient creatures like Firedrinker Satyr, Foundry Street Denizen, and Monastery Swiftspear, along with spells like Lightning Strike, Wild Slash, and Stoke the Flames to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Hordeling Outburst and Goblin Rabblemaster helps to generate additional creatures to keep up the pressure. Overall, the goal is to outpace the opponent and win the game as fast as possible."
