By playing creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster, Monastery Swiftspear, and Firedrinker Satyr alongside burn spells like Lightning Strike and Wild Slash, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently to bring down the opponent's life total as fast as possible. The deck also includes cards like Hordeling Outburst and Searing Blood to maintain pressure and control the battlefield, ultimately leading to a swift victory."
