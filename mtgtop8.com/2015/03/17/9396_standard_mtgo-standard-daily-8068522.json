The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall while applying pressure with efficient threats like Siege Rhino and Anafenza, the Foremost. The deck also includes planeswalkers like Sorin, Solemn Visitor and Elspeth, Sun's Champion to generate additional advantage and close out games. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the three-color Aggro strategy and ensure consistency in casting spells."
