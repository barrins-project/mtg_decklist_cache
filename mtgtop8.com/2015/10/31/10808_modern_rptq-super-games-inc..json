The deck aims to control the board with efficient removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Path to Exile, while also gaining life and value through cards like Siege Rhino and Lingering Souls. The deck's creatures are powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Tasigur, supported by cards like Scavenging Ooze for graveyard interaction. The deck also utilizes Zealous Persecution for a possible combat trick or a board-wide boost. Lastly, the mana base is designed to support the three-color combination efficiently."
