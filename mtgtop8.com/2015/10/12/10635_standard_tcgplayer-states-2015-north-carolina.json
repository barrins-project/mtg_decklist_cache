By using low-cost aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Zurgo Bellstriker, paired with powerful pump spells like Become Immense and Atarka's Command, the deck aims to apply pressure early and close out the game quickly. Retreat to Valakut can provide additional reach with its landfall ability, while Exquisite Firecraft acts as a finishing blow to seal the deal. Overall, the deck focuses on a relentless assault to take down the opponent swiftly."

The deck focuses on using counterspells like Silumgar's Scorn and Scatter to the Winds, along with removal spells like Utter End and Foul-Tongue Invocation to control the board. The deck also includes powerful dragons like Dragonlord Ojutai and Silumgar, the Drifting Death to finish the game. Additionally, it uses cards like Dig Through Time and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon for card advantage and board control. The mana base is designed to support the Control archetype."
