By combining efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Zurgo Bellstriker with pump spells like Become Immense and Atarka's Command, the deck can quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. Retreat to Valakut provides additional reach and board control, while the land base ensures consistent access to the necessary colors and landfall triggers. Overall, the strategy is to deploy threats early and consistently apply pressure to secure a quick victory."
