The deck also includes control elements like Remand and Dispel to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Other control cards like Lightning Bolt and Cryptic Command help manage the board and buy time until the combo can be assembled. Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage provide card selection and recurring value, ensuring the deck can consistently find and execute the combo."
