The deck relies on cards like Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top to manipulate the top of the deck, while also using Jace, the Mind Sculptor for card advantage and board control. The win conditions include Entreat the Angels for a swarm of flying creatures and Council's Judgment for flexible removal. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and out-value them over the course of the game."
