By combining the lifegain from cards like Siege Rhino and Shambling Vent with the landfall triggers from Retreat to Hagra, Kazandu, and Emeria, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of consistent damage output and incremental advantage. The combination of powerful creatures and enchantments synergizes to create a strong and resilient aggro strategy."
