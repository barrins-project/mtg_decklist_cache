Death's Shadow becomes a powerhouse as your life total decreases. The deck also includes cards like Lightning Bolt for removal, Gitaxian Probe for hand information, and Mishra's Bauble for card advantage. The mana base is built around fetch lands and shock lands to ensure consistent access to the required colors."
