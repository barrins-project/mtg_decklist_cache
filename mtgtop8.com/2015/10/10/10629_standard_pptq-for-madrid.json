The deck's curve allows for an aggressive early game with cards like Warden of the First Tree and Hangarback Walker, while also providing late-game power with cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Ob Nixilis Reignited. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistent casting of spells in all three colors."
