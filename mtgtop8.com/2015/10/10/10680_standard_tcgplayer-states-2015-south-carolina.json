The deck aims to keep the opponent's board clear and their threats at bay through counterspells like Silumgar's Scorn and Scatter to the Winds. Removal spells such as Ruinous Path, Reave Soul, and Complete Disregard help to eliminate any creatures that do make it onto the battlefield. Additionally, the deck includes card draw with Dig Through Time to ensure a steady flow of resources and answers. The win condition of the deck is to eventually play powerful dragon creatures like Dragonlord Ojutai and Silumgar, the Drifting Death."
