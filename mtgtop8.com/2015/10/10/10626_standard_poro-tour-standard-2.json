The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Foul-Tongue Invocation and Complete Disregard while also maintaining card advantage through Dig Through Time. The powerful dragons like Dragonlord Ojutai and Silumgar, the Drifting Death provide strong win conditions, while cards like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Crux of Fate act as board wipes to deal with threats. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through superior card advantage and powerful creatures."
