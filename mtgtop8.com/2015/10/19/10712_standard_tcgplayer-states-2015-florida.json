It aims to control the board through counterspells like Dispel and protection spells like Valorous Stance, while utilizing card draw spells like Dig Through Time to maintain card advantage. The inclusion of flyers like Wingmate Roc and Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker provide additional threats in the air to pressure the opponent."
