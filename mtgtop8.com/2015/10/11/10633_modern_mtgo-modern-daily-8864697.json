            "notes": "This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and efficient removal spells. By playing efficient early creatures like Wild Nacatl and Noble Hierarch, it can quickly establish a threatening board presence. The deck also runs powerful mid-game threats like Tarmogoyf and Knight of the Reliquary to maintain pressure. With a mix of removal spells like Path to Exile and Lightning Bolt, the deck can clear the way for its creatures to attack. The inclusion of Collected Company allows for explosive turns and additional creature recursion. Overall, the deck focuses on proactive plays to win the game quickly."
