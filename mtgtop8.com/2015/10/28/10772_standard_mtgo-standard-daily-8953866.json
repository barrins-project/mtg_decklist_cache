The deck aims to apply early pressure with efficient creatures like Hangarback Walker and Anafenza, the Foremost, supported by powerful spells like Abzan Charm and Dromoka's Command for removal and combat tricks. The deck also includes resilient threats like Siege Rhino and Wingmate Roc to maintain pressure on the opponent. Additionally, the inclusion of Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides another win condition and creates additional threats on the battlefield."
