By playing low-cost, high-powered creatures like Kird Ape, Goblin Guide, and Tarmogoyf, along with supporting cards like Atarka's Command and Boros Charm, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize. The mana base is streamlined to ensure consistency and speed in casting spells."
