            "notes": "The main strategy of this deck is to use a combination of Elf creatures and powerful spells like Natural Order and Green Sun's Zenith to quickly generate mana and card advantage. By efficiently utilizing cards like Quirion Ranger, Nettle Sentinel, and Glimpse of Nature, the player can chain together multiple creature plays in a single turn, eventually casting a lethal Craterhoof Behemoth to finish off the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a rapid tempo while also having the flexibility to disrupt any threats with cards like Reclamation Sage."
