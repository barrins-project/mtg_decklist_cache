It combines powerful and flexible spells like Thoughtseize, Gitaxian Probe, and Lightning Bolt with resilient threats like Tarmogoyf, Monastery Swiftspear, and Death's Shadow. The deck aims to pressure the opponent early and often, while also disrupting their game plan with discard and removal spells. The mana base supports a variety of colors to cast the deck's spells efficiently. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win the game before they can establish a board presence."
