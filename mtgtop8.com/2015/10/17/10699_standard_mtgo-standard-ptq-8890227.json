By consistently playing creatures like Zurgo Bellstriker and Monastery Swiftspear alongside burn spells like Wild Slash and Titan's Strength, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent from the very beginning and secure a victory through sheer aggression. The deck also utilizes pump spells like Temur Battle Rage and Become Immense to enhance the damage potential of its creatures."
