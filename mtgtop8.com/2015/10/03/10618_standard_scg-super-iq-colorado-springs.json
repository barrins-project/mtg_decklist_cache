By combining strong creatures with abilities like Zulaport Cutthroat and Kalastria Healer, the deck aims to drain the opponent's life total quickly and efficiently. With cards like Gather the Pack and Collected Company to help dig for combo pieces, the deck looks to overwhelm the opponent with a sudden burst of power and quickly close out the game."
