            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly assembling a board with cheap artifact creatures and using Cranial Plating to pump them up for fast and efficient damage. Steel Overseer and Etched Champion provide additional benefits for the artifact creatures, while Galvanic Blast can serve as removal or extra damage to close out the game. The land base is optimized for maximum mana efficiency and synergy with the artifact theme. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creature pressure and direct damage spells."
