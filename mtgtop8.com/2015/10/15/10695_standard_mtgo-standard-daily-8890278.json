By playing low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Zurgo Bellstriker, you can deal damage early on while setting up for bigger threats like Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh. Atarka's Command and Titan's Strength provide additional damage boosts, while Temur Battle Rage and Become Immense can help finish off your opponent in a single turn. This deck focuses on speed, aggression, and efficient use of burn spells to defeat your opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
