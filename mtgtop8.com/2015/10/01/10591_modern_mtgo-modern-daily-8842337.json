            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with a combination of low-cost artifacts and creatures, boosting their power with equipment like Cranial Plating. The key strategy is to play aggressively and efficiently, using cards like Arcbound Ravager and Steel Overseer to grow your creatures and finish off your opponent with cards like Galvanic Blast. The deck also includes protection in the form of Spellskite and Etched Champion, as well as the ability to win through poison counters using cards like Inkmoth Nexus. The goal is to quickly take control of the game and defeat your opponent before they can respond effectively."
