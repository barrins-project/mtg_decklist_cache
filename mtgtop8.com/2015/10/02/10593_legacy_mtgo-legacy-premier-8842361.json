The deck includes key cards like Gaea's Cradle, Natural Order, and Glimpse of Nature to facilitate this strategy, along with a variety of Elves such as Wirewood Symbiote, Nettle Sentinel, and Heritage Druid to generate mana and draw cards. The goal is to quickly build a formidable board presence and finish off the opponent in a single explosive turn."
