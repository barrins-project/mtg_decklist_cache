The deck focuses on generating incremental advantages through cards like Ancestral Vision, Hymn to Tourach, and Deathrite Shaman, while also deploying powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Shardless Agent. The deck also plays a suite of versatile removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Force of Will to deal with opposing threats, while also having access to powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Jace, the Mind Sculptor for additional value and control."
