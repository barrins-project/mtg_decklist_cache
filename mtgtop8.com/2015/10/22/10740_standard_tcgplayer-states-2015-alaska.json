The deck includes low-cost creatures with haste and abilities that boost their power, as well as instant spells that can target both creatures and opponents to deal additional damage. The deck also includes a few bigger creatures and Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh for additional firepower. The mana base consists of lands that can enter the battlefield untapped to ensure a fast and smooth mana curve for consistent aggression."
