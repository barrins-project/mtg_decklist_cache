By using a combination of efficient creatures like Deathmist Raptor and Hangarback Walker, along with versatile removal spells like Valorous Stance and Dromoka's Command, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent and maintain board control. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Wingmate Roc provide additional threats and support, while cards like Den Protector and Nissa, Vastwood Seer offer card advantage and resilience. The mana base is optimized to support the aggressive game plan with a mix of dual lands and fetch lands."
