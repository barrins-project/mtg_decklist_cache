Cards like Beast Within and Fulminator Mage help disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Simian Spirit Guide allows for explosive plays. The deck is focused on efficiently cycling through the deck, setting up powerful combo turns with Living End."

It includes powerful creatures like Wild Nacatl, Knight of the Reliquary, and Tarmogoyf, supported by ramp from Noble Hierarch and removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile. The deck also includes disruptive creatures like Scavenging Ooze and Qasali Pridemage to disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a strong mana base and the ability to search for key lands like Kessig Wolf Run, the deck aims to end the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
