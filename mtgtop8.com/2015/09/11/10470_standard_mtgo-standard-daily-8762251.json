By playing multiple low-cost creatures and generating creature tokens, the deck aims to maintain a constant pressure on the opponent, dealing damage efficiently and swiftly. The inclusion of cards like Stoke the Flames and Obelisk of Urd enhances the deck's overall power and potential for burst damage. The deck's focus is to consistently attack and advance towards victory at a rapid pace, making it a formidable choice for aggressive gameplay."
