The goal is to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and maintain that pressure until victory, utilizing cards like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Atarka's Command to deal direct damage. The deck also includes creatures with haste like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear to deliver quick damage. The strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and relentless assault, ending the game before they can stabilize."

Utilizing a mix of removal spells like Path to Exile and Lightning Bolt, as well as counterspells like Spell Snare and Disrupting Shoal, the deck aims to establish dominance on the battlefield while maintaining card advantage with cards like Gitaxian Probe. The mana base is carefully crafted to ensure smooth color access for the powerful UWx cards in the deck."
