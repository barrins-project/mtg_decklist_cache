Beast Within and Faerie Macabre provide additional removal and disruption, allowing you to control the board and secure your victory. This deck aims to consistently execute its game plan and win through overwhelming creature advantage."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on playing multiple artifact creatures quickly and efficiently to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creature attacks. With cards like Cranial Plating and Arcbound Ravager, the goal is to pump up creatures with strong equipment and sacrifice artifacts to create even bigger threats. Steel Overseer helps further boost the power of the creatures on the board, while cards like Galvanic Blast provide additional removal and direct damage to secure victory. The key to winning with this deck is to play aggressively and efficiently to maximize the potential of each artifact creature."
