It also has a good amount of removal spells to deal with the opponent's threats. The deck has a good mix of creatures, removal, and planeswalkers to ensure that it can adapt to different matchups and stay ahead on board presence. The mana base is well-tailored to support the deck's three-color combination of black, white, and green."
