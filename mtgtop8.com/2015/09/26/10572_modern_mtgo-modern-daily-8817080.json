By using cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to quickly get artifacts onto the battlefield, along with powerful cards like Cranial Plating and Steel Overseer to boost their effectiveness, this deck can put a lot of pressure on the opponent early in the game. With cards like Arcbound Ravager and Etched Champion providing additional versatility and protection, this deck is designed to be aggressive and difficult for the opponent to deal with."
