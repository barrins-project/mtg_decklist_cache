By controlling the board with cards like Ruinous Path and Languish, while also having access to powerful threats like Dragonlord Silumgar and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, the deck aims to grind the opponent out of resources and win the game through incremental advantage. The deck also has a strong mana base with fetch lands like Polluted Delta and dual lands like Sunken Hollow to ensure consistent access to all its colors."
