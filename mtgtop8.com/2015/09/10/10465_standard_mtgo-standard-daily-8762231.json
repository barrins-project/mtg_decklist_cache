By efficiently utilizing cards like Abbot of Keral Keep, Monastery Swiftspear, and Pia and Kiran Nalaar to apply pressure early on, combined with burn spells like Exquisite Firecraft, Lightning Strike, and Stoke the Flames to finish off the opponent, the deck aims to end the game swiftly before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of artifact creatures like Hangarback Walker and Thopter Engineer further boosts the deck's aggressive strategy."
