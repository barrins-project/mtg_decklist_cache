By utilizing cards like Ghostfire Blade and Springleaf Drum to enhance their effectiveness, as well as having supplementary burn spells like Stoke the Flames and Shrapnel Blast, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its aggressive tactics. Thopter Engineer and Pia and Kiran Nalaar provide additional utility and token generation to maintain board presence and pressure opponents. Ultimately, this deck aims to quickly close out games through a mix of creature beatdown and burn damage."
