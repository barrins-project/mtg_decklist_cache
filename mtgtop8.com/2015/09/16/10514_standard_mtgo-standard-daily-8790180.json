Whirler Rogue provides evasion and additional artifact synergy, while Phyrexian Revoker disrupts opponents' strategies. The mana base includes cards like Temple of Epiphany and Shivan Reef to ensure consistent casting of spells. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and aggressive artifact-based strategy."
