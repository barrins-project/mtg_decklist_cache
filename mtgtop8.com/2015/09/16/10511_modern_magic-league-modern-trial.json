The deck focuses on playing aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, while also utilizing burn spells such as Lava Spike, Lightning Bolt, and Boros Charm to quickly reduce the opponent's life total. The deck also includes cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Atarka's Command to further increase the pressure on the opponent. Overall, the strategy is to quickly deal damage and win the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The deck utilizes a mix of cantrips, fast mana sources, and protection spells to facilitate this combo as quickly and consistently as possible. With careful resource management and timing, the player aims to go off before their opponent can disrupt them, providing a fast and powerful win condition in Modern 1 vs 1."
