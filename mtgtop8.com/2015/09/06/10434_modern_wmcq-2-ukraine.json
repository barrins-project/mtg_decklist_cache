The deck utilizes cards like Heritage Druid and Elvish Archdruid to tap multiple Elves for mana, enabling explosive plays. The deck focuses on creating a powerful Elf synergy and overwhelming the opponent with a quick and efficient combo."

By drawing cards and forcing the opponent to do the same, the player can set up a lock on the game and win by either milling out the opponent or attacking with an unblockable creature. It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up its own win condition through card advantage and tempo manipulation."
