By using a combination of removal spells, counterspells, and powerful planeswalkers like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver, the deck aims to dominate the game through card advantage and strategic plays. Dragonlord Ojutai and Dragonlord Silumgar provide additional threats and win conditions, while maintaining control over the game tempo. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and provide consistency in casting spells."

The deck also features a strong mana base with Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Foundry of the Consuls to ensure consistent and efficient mana production."
