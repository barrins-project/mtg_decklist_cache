By utilizing cards like Abbot of Keral Keep, Monastery Swiftspear, and Zurgo Bellstriker, along with powerful burn spells like Lightning Strike and Exquisite Firecraft, this deck aims to maintain constant pressure and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Searing Blood and Wild Slash also helps control the board and clear a path for the aggressive creatures to attack directly."
