By playing cards like Goblin Guide, Monastery Swiftspear, and Eidolon of the Great Revel, combined with powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Lava Spike, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize. This aggressive strategy requires precise sequencing and careful resource management to outpace opposing decks and secure a swift victory."
