The deck also includes powerful removal spells like Ultimate Price and Hero's Downfall, along with versatile cards such as Abzan Charm and Dromoka's Command for added flexibility. The deck's mana base is built around the Abzan colors, with a mix of dual lands and Temple lands to ensure consistent mana production. The goal is to put pressure on opponents early and maintain a strong board presence throughout the game."
