The deck aims to generate value by sacrificing creatures and creating zombie tokens with Bridge from Below, while disrupting your opponent's game plan with disruption cards like Cabal Therapy and Force of Will. The deck also includes key lands like Bazaar of Baghdad and Library of Alexandria to help draw through your deck and further fuel your graveyard."
