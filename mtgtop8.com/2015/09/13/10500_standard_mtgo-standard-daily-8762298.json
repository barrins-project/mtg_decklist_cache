            "notes": "The main idea behind this deck is to aggressively use cheap, efficient creatures and spells to deal damage quickly to the opponent. By utilizing cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Abbot of Keral Keep, along with burn spells like Searing Blood and Stoke the Flames, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and consistent damage output. Thopter Engineer and Pia and Kiran Nalaar provide additional creatures and reach, while Shrapnel Blast and Exquisite Firecraft offer direct damage to finish off the opponent. The mana base is streamlined with mainly Mountains and Darksteel Citadels for quick and smooth gameplay."
