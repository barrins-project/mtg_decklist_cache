            "notes": "The primary focus of this deck is to swarm the battlefield with low-cost white creatures (weenies) and apply constant pressure on the opponent. This is achieved through cards like Soldier of the Pantheon, Knight of the White Orchid, and Hangarback Walker. Additionally, the deck features powerful support cards such as Archangel of Tithes and Wingmate Roc to maintain board control and provide additional threats. The inclusion of Mastery of the Unseen and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx helps generate mana and create more creatures to overwhelm the opponent."
