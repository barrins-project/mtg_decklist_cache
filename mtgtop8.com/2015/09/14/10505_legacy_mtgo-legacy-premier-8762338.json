            "notes": "This deck aims to quickly and efficiently bring out powerful creatures such as Emrakul and Griselbrand by using cards like Show and Tell and Sneak Attack. It utilizes a range of card draw and manipulation spells like Gitaxian Probe, Ponder, and Brainstorm to find the combo pieces and protect them with counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce. The mana base is designed for speed and consistency, with acceleration from Lotus Petal and lands like Ancient Tomb and City of Traitors. The deck's goal is to overwhelm the opponent with its big creatures and win the game quickly."
