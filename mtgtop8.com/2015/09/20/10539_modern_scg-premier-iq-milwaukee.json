Once in the late game, the deck can overwhelm the opponent with Sun Titan and Emeria, the Sky Ruin to grind out value and finish the game. The deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through attrition and card advantage."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly generate a large number of token creatures and use them to overwhelm the opponent. Cards like Lingering Souls, Spectral Procession, and Bitterblossom create multiple tokens at once, which can be further boosted by Intangible Virtue. These tokens can then be used to attack the opponent's life total or provide chump blockers. The deck also utilizes disruptive cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize to remove threats from the opponent's hand, while removal spells like Path to Exile and Dismember deal with their creatures."
