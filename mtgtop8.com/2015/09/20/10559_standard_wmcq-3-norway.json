It aims to control the board with sweepers like Languish and Silence the Believers, while also using planeswalkers like Ashiok and Ugin to generate advantage. The deck also relies on card draw with Jace's Ingenuity and Dig Through Time to find key cards. Overall, the strategy involves maintaining control of the game until it can win through card advantage and powerful threats like Silumgar, the Drifting Death."
