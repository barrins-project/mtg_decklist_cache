The key strategy is to quickly build up a strong board presence with low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Abbot of Keral Keep, while using burn spells like Lightning Strike and Searing Blood to clear the way for attacks. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Zurgo Bellstriker and Lightning Berserker to keep up the pressure and close out the game quickly."
