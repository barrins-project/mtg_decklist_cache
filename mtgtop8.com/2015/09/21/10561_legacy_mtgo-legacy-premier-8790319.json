By using cards like Ensnaring Bridge, Sphere of Resistance, and Chalice of the Void, you can limit your opponent's options while still being able to deploy threats like Lodestone Golem and Mishra's Factory. With cards like Ratchet Bomb and Smokestack, you can further control the board and keep your opponent on the back foot. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm and outlast your opponent with efficient and disruptive plays."
