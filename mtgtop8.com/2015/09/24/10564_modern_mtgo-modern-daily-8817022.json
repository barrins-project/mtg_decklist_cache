            "notes": "The primary strategy of this deck is to use powerful pump spells and evasion abilities to quickly poison your opponent with as few attacks as possible. Cards like Mutagenic Growth, Might of Old Krosa, and Become Immense increase the power of your infect creatures, while Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing protect them from removal spells. The inclusion of Wild Defiance also punishes opponents for attempting to remove your creatures. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with fast, lethal infect damage before they have a chance to react."
