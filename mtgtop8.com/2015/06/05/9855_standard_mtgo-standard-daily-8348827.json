It also includes some disruption cards like Thoughtseize and Foul-Tongue Invocation to disrupt the opponent's plans and gain an advantage. The deck's key strategy is to apply early pressure with creatures like Seeker of the Way and Goblin Rabblemaster, while finishing off the opponent with powerful dragons like Stormbreath Dragon and Thunderbreak Regent. Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury provides additional reach and can help close out games quickly."

With a mix of burn spells like Atarka's Command, Lightning Strike, Stoke the Flames, and Wild Slash, the deck can both finish off the opponent and remove any threats in the way. The mana base is optimized for consistency and speed in order to maintain a relentless assault on the opponent."
