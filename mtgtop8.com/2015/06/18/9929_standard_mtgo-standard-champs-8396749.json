By efficiently utilizing creatures like Mantis Rider and Goblin Rabblemaster, along with removal spells like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames, the deck can quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Soulfire Grand Master and Ojutai's Command provide both lifegain and extra utility in order to maintain board presence and card advantage. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistent access to all colors of mana needed to cast spells across all three colors of the Jeskai color pie."
