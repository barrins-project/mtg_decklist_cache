The deck features a variety of aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Rabblemaster, along with burn spells like Wild Slash and Lightning Strike to keep the pressure on. The inclusion of cards like Atarka's Command and Hordeling Outburst allows for additional damage potential and board presence."
