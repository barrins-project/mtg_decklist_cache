By ramping up with mana accelerants like Sylvan Caryatid and Courser of Kruphix, the deck can establish a strong board presence and control the game with threats like Dragonlord Ojutai and Deathmist Raptor. The inclusion of hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and removal spells like Hero's Downfall allows the deck to disrupt the opponent's game plan while continuing to apply pressure with its aggressive creatures."
