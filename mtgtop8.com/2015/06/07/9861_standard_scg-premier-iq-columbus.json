By playing efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Rabblemaster, and backing them up with powerful burn spells such as Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total. Outpost Siege provides card advantage and additional damage potential, while Soulfire Grand Master gives the deck longevity and the ability to recur burn spells. With a consistent mana base and a blend of creature threats and burn spells, this deck aims to win fast-paced games."
