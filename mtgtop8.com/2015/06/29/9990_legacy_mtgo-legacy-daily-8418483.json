            "notes": "The main strategy of this Aggro - MUD Legacy deck is to disrupt and control the opponent with cards like Ensnaring Bridge, Tangle Wire, and Sphere of Resistance while maintaining pressure with creatures like Lodestone Golem and using disruptive lands like Rishadan Port and Wasteland. Crucible of Worlds allows for land recursion and Smokestack helps to further disrupt the opponent's board position. Chalice of the Void is used to shut down low-cost spells, creating a difficult board state for the opponent to navigate. Overall, the deck aims to lock down the opponent's resources while steadily advancing its own game plan."
