With cards like Goblin Rabblemaster and Monastery Swiftspear leading the charge, supported by removal spells like Crackling Doom and Lightning Strike, the deck can quickly close out games. Outpost Siege provides card advantage to keep the pressure on, while the mana base allows for consistent casting of spells."
