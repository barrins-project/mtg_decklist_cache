The deck also includes cards like Den Protector and Courser of Kruphix for card advantage and tempo. Elspeth, Sun's Champion provides a powerful finisher while removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Abzan Charm help control the board. Thoughtseize allows for disruption against opposing strategies, and the deck can quickly rebuild with cards like Wingmate Roc. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board control throughout the game."
