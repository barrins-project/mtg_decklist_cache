By using cards like Zur the Enchanter to fetch important enchantments like Steel of the Godhead, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and disrupt their game plan. Geist of Saint Traft and other threats provide pressure while the control elements protect and support them. The mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility, allowing the deck to adapt to different situations and match-ups. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and secure a win through a combination of card advantage and threats."
