It aims to stall the game early with removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Terminus, while using Counterspell and Force of Will to protect its game-winning threats like Entreat the Angels and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. Sensei's Divining Top and Counterbalance create a powerful lock that allows the deck to control the opponent's spells effectively. The deck's game plan revolves around controlling the board and winning the long game with powerful threats and card advantage."
