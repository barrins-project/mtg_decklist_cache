The key strategy is to efficiently summon Elves to generate mana and then use that mana to overwhelm the opponent with high-impact creatures like Ezuri, Renegade Leader. By combining fast mana generation with efficient creature tutoring, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a quick and deadly combo."
