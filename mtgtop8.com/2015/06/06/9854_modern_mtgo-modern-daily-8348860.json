The deck's mana base is carefully constructed to support a variety of spells and ensure consistency in casting its powerful spells."

The deck utilizes a mix of counterspells, removal, and card advantage spells to maintain control over the game. Snapcaster Mage allows for extra value by flashing back key spells while mana fixing lands like Flooded Strand and Scalding Tarn help ensure the player has the right colored mana to cast their spells."
