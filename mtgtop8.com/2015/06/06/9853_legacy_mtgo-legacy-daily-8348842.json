The deck also includes a strong synergy between Sensei's Divining Top and Counterbalance to continuously control the opponent's spells. Additionally, the sideboard provides additional hate cards and flexibility against different strategies. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent in a slow, grindy game."
