It utilizes pump spells and protection spells to enhance its creatures and ensure they can get through for lethal poison counters. By playing aggressively and efficiently, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize or mount a defense. The key strategy is to quickly build up infect counters on the opponent while protecting its own creatures from removal and blockers."
