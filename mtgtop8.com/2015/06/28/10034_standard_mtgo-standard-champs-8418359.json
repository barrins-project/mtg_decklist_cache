By utilizing strong creatures like Siege Rhino and Fleecemane Lion, along with removal spells like Abzan Charm and Hero's Downfall, you can control the board while dealing damage quickly. Cards like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Den Protector provide additional value and versatility to help maintain pressure on your opponent. Building a solid mana base with dual lands and mana-fixing cards ensures that you can consistently cast your spells and keep the pressure on your opponent."
