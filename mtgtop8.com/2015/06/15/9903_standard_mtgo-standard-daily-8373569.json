The key strategy is to ramp up mana production early with mana dorks like Elvish Mystic and Sylvan Caryatid, then play high-impact threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Dragonlord Atarka. Cards like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Crater's Claws provide additional reach and finishers, while cards like Courser of Kruphix and Xenagos, the Reveler help maintain card advantage and provide extra mana. The deck aims to pressure the opponent quickly and finish them off before they can stabilize."
