By utilizing cards like Arcbound Ravager and Cranial Plating, along with mana ramp from Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, the deck aims to pump out damage fast and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Signal Pest and Steel Overseer further enhances the aggro strategy, while cards like Etched Champion and Spellskite provide protection and resilience against opposing threats. The deck's key strength lies in its ability to quickly build a threatening board presence and close out the game before the opponent can respond effectively."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly deploying a board of artifact creatures and utilizing cards like Cranial Plating and Ensoul Artifact to buff them up and finish off the opponent quickly. Steel Overseer and Signal Pest help to pump up the team, while Arcbound Ravager and Vault Skirge provide additional threats and resilience. With a mix of evasion from flying creatures like Ornithopter and Inkmoth Nexus, along with removal options like Galvanic Blast and Dismember, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggression and efficient use of its artifacts."
