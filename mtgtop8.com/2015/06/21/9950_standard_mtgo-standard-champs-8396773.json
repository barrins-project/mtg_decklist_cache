The focus is on generating mana quickly with creatures like Elvish Mystic and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx to cast big creatures like Avatar of the Resolute and Deathmist Raptor. Collected Company allows for additional creature plays and the deck aims to maintain a steady stream of threats to pressure the opponent and secure a fast victory."
