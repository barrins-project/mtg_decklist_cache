The deck also includes versatile removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Dromoka's Command to handle threats efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Wingmate Roc and Warden of the First Tree provides additional late-game power and versatility. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the aggressive game plan while also providing consistent access to the deck's powerful three-color spells."
