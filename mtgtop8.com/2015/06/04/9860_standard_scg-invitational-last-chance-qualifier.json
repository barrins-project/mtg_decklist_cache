            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, aggressive creatures and direct damage spells. It focuses on building a wide board quickly with low-cost creatures like Foundry Street Denizen, Monastery Swiftspear, and Akroan Crusader, then buffing them with spells like Titan's Strength and Atarka's Command to deal damage efficiently. The inclusion of burn spells like Wild Slash and Hammerhand adds additional reach and control to keep the pressure on the opponent. The deck's goal is to win the game as quickly as possible by keeping the pressure on the opponent and finishing them off with direct damage spells."
