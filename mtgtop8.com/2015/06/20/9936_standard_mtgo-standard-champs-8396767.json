By combining cheap creatures like Tormented Hero and Bloodsoaked Champion with powerful finishers like Mogis's Marauder and Mardu Strike Leader, the deck aims to deal quick and efficient damage to the opponent. The inclusion of disruptive spells like Bile Blight and Ultimate Price helps to control the board and maintain the advantage throughout the game."
