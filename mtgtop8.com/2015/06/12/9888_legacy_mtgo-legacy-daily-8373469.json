By utilizing cards like Brainstorm, Terminus, and Ponder to filter through the deck and find answers, as well as Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top to control the top of the opponent's library, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and stabilize the board. Additional removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Counterspells, along with versatile cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, help to maintain control and outvalue the opponent."
