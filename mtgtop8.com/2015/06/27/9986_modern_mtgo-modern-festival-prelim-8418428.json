The deck includes a lot of control elements like counterspells and removal spells to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck is built around consistency and speed, aiming to assemble the combo as quickly as possible while also maintaining a strong defense against threats. The key strategy is to use disruption and card advantage to protect the combo and control the game until you can win with the Twin combo."

It utilizes Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play, along with lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to boost their power and toughness. Spreading Seas disrupts the opponent's lands and enables islandwalk for the Merfolk. The deck also includes disruption spells like Vapor Snag and Spell Pierce to control the game tempo. Overall, the strategy is to flood the board with powerful Merfolk creatures and win the game through combat damage."
