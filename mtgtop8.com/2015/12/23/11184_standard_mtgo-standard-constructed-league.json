The deck focuses on generating a large amount of mana to cast these high-cost cards quickly and efficiently, while also using control elements like Negate and Dispel to disrupt opponent's strategies. Additionally, cards like Nissa's Pilgrimage and Whisperwood Elemental help provide card advantage and board presence."

By using cards like Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Soulfire Grand Master to recur spells and generate value, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind them out over time. Monastery Mentor provides a win condition by creating an army of tokens, while Crackling Doom and Kolaghan's Command help deal with threats on the board. Overall, the deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan while generating incremental advantage to secure victory."

The deck aims to quickly build a wide board presence through token generators like Hordeling Outburst and Dragon Fodder, while utilizing prowess creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Abbot of Keral Keep to deal additional damage. With efficient removal spells like Wild Slash and Fiery Impulse, along with powerful finishers like Temur Battle Rage and Become Immense, this deck is designed to close out games swiftly."
