            "notes": "The main focus of this Modern 1 vs 1 Infect deck is to quickly ramp up poison counters on your opponent through evasion and pump spells. Utilizing creatures like Glistener Elf and Blighted Agent along with pump spells like Might of Old Krosa and Groundswell, you aim to deal 10 total poison counters to win the game. Protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing help keep your infect creatures alive, while cards like Serum Visions and Gitaxian Probe help with card draw and deck manipulation. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, infectious creatures and spells."

            "notes": "This Abzan Aggro deck focuses on using efficient removal spells like Path to Exile and Abrupt Decay to clear the way for powerful threats such as Tarmogoyf, Siege Rhino, and Tasigur, the Golden Fang. Lingering Souls provides a constant stream of flying tokens, while Kitchen Finks and Scavenging Ooze help to stabilize against aggressive decks. Liliana of the Veil disrupts the opponent's hand and board, while also providing a win condition. The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain control of the game through a combination of threats and disruption."
