The deck also includes disruption cards like Beast Within and Faerie Macabre to control opponent's threats. It aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and disrupt their game plan while building up your own board presence. The goal is to win the game through a combination of efficient cycling, powerful creatures, and disruption spells."
