            "notes": "The key strategy of this deck is to use lands as control elements, utilizing cards like Rishadan Port, Wasteland, and Maze of Ith to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The combo of Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage allows for a quick win condition if left unchecked. Cards like Life from the Loam and Gamble provide card advantage and consistency, while Punishing Fire offers removal. With cards like Manabond and Exploration, the deck aims to ramp up its mana quickly to execute its game plan efficiently. The emphasis is on controlling the game through strategic land manipulation and win conditions."
