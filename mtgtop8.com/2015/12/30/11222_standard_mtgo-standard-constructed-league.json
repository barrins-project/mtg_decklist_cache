By deploying threats like Monastery Swiftspear, Zurgo Bellstriker, and Dragon Fodder, and supplementing them with powerful spells like Wild Slash, Titan's Strength, and Temur Battle Rage, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. Atarka's Command provides additional reach and flexibility, while Become Immense can close out games in a single swing."
