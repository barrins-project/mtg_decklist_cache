By quickly playing aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Zurgo Bellstriker, supported by burn spells like Wild Slash and Atarka's Command, you aim to deal damage to your opponent as quickly as possible. This deck focuses on maintaining a high tempo and applying constant pressure on your opponent, forcing them to react defensively while you continue to push for the win."
