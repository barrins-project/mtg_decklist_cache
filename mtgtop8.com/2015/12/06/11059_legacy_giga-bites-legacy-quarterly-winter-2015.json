The deck can quickly ramp into its threats using Chrome Mox and Simian Spirit Guide, and can also utilize powerful equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice and Umezawa's Jitte to further overwhelm opponents in combat. Overall, this deck is focused on establishing a strong board presence and limiting the opponent's options to secure a quick victory."
