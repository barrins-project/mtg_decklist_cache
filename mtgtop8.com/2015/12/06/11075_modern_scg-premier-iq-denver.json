By controlling the board with counterspells and removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Roast, the deck aims to stall the game until it can assemble the combo. Snapcaster Mage allows for spell recursion, while cards like Serum Visions and Vendilion Clique provide card selection and manipulation. The deck aims to efficiently control the game and combo off for a quick win."
