It aims to control the board with efficient removal and deal direct damage to the opponent's life total as fast as possible. The main strategy is to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react defensively, while maintaining a fast pace of attacking and burning. The key concept revolves around overwhelming the opponent with fast, efficient threats and burning them out before they can stabilize."
