Lingering Souls provides evasive threats and helps to generate additional value. The deck also features removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Path to Exile to deal with opposing threats. The addition of powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil adds another layer of disruption and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
