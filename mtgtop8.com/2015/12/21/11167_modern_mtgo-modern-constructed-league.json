This is achieved through cards such as Lantern of Insight, Codex Shredder, and Ghoulcaller's Bell. The deck also features disruptive elements like Ensnaring Bridge and Pithing Needle to further hinder the opponent's options. The deck aims to maintain a low hand size and prevent the opponent from executing their game plan effectively. An important aspect of this deck is also resource management, with cards like Mox Opal and Ancient Stirrings helping to ensure consistent access to the necessary tools."
