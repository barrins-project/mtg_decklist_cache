The key strategy involves combining efficient land bouncing with summoning powerful creatures like Primeval Titan to overwhelm the opponent quickly. By leveraging cards like Summer Bloom and Azusa, Lost but Seeking, the deck can ramp up mana production and consistently summon game-winning threats. The inclusion of Hive Mind grants the potential to force opponents into unfavorable situations, making the deck versatile and difficult to predict or counter effectively."

The key strategy is to control the game early on with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, then use Eldrazi Temple and Eye of Ugin to quickly bring out big threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. Cards like Blight Herder and Oblivion Sower provide additional value by either creating tokens or exiling cards from the opponent's library. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and overwhelm them with large, game-ending threats."
