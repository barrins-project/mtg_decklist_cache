It includes powerful cards such as Siege Rhino and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar to establish a strong board presence. The deck also incorporates removal spells like Silkwrap and Murderous Cut to deal with opposing threats. By combining efficient creatures with versatile removal and combat tricks like Dromoka's Command, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
