The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with quick and efficient plays, utilizing card draw and filtering with Brainstorm, Preordain, and Ponder to find the combo pieces quickly. It relies on the element of surprise and high-risk, high-reward plays to dominate the game and win before the opponent can establish their own game plan."

By casting multiple spells in a single turn, the deck aims to build up a lethal storm count and finish the game with Tendrils of Agony or Ad Nauseam. Additionally, disruption cards like Cabal Therapy and Duress help control the opponent's hand and protect the combo player's game plan. The deck is focused on executing a powerful storm combo as quickly and efficiently as possible."
