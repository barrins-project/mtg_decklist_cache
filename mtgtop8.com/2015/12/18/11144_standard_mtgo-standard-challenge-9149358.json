The mana base is optimized for consistency and allows for flexibility in casting spells. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar adds another dimension to the deck's strategy. The deck aims to pressure opponents with a mix of creature threats and removal spells, ultimately overwhelming them with a high-powered board state."
