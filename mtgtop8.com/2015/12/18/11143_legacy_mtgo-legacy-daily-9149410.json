Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment and the Stoneforge Mystic package provides additional threats and equipment to enhance the board state. With a focus on taxing the opponent's resources and maintaining board control through cards like Flickerwisp and Mother of Runes, Death &amp; Taxes aims to outmaneuver traditional control and combo strategies in Legacy 1 vs 1 format."
