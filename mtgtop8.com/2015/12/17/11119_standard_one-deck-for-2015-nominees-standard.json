The strategy revolves around sacrificing creatures like Nantuko Husk and Fleshbag Marauder to trigger effects from cards like Mogis's Marauder and Grim Haruspex, gaining advantages and pressuring the opponent. With a mix of graveyard recursion, sacrifice effects, and creature synergy, this deck looks to create explosive turns and outvalue the opponent in the mid-to-late game."

The deck also includes powerful anthem effects such as Archangel of Tithes and Wingmate Roc to buff the team of creatures. With cards like Banishing Light for removal and Mastery of the Unseen for card advantage, this aggro deck aims to establish a strong board presence quickly and maintain pressure throughout the game."
