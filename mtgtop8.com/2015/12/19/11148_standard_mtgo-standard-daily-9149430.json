By playing creatures like Anafenza, the Foremost and Siege Rhino, along with efficient removal like Abzan Charm and Murderous Cut, the deck aims to apply constant pressure while controlling the board. The inclusion of Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Wingmate Roc provides additional threats and ways to close out the game quickly. The mana base is built to support the color requirements of the deck and ensure consistent plays throughout the game."
