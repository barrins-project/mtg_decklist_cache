            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly deploying artifact creatures and leveraging various synergies to overwhelm the opponent. By combining aggressive creatures like Arcbound Ravager and Signal Pest with powerful equipment like Cranial Plating, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Steel Overseer and Mox Opal allows for explosive starts and the ability to quickly build a formidable board presence. Additionally, the mana base is optimized to support the deck's artifact-heavy strategy while also enabling the use of Inkmoth Nexus as an alternate win condition."
