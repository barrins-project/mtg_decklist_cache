By using cards like Silumgar's Scorn and Foul-Tongue Invocation to disrupt the opponent's plans, along with Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Dig Through Time to dig for key cards, the deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent. Dragonlord Ojutai and Dragonlord Silumgar provide powerful win conditions, with Ugin, the Spirit Dragon as a backup for closing out games. The deck's mana base allows for consistent access to all of its colors, ensuring it can cast its spells efficiently."
