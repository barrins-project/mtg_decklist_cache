The goal is to disrupt the opponent's strategy with hand disruption spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, while using removal like Lightning Bolt and Terminate to deal with threats. The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to generate card advantage and disrupt the opponent's resources. Tarmogoyf and other efficient threats are used to close out the game quickly once the opponent's defenses have been weakened."
