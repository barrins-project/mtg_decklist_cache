It aims to control the board with cards like Karakas and Phyrexian Revoker, while also utilizing Aether Vial to cheat in creatures and keep up with opponents' tempo. The inclusion of Silverblade Paladin and equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Sword of Fire and Ice allows for quick and efficient damage output. Overall, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence and overwhelm opponents with a combination of disruption and aggression."
