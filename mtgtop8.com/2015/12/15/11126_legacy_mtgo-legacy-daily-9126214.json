            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly flood the board with low-cost artifact creatures and equipment, such as Mox Opal, Cranial Plating, and Arcbound Ravager, to overwhelm the opponent with damage. The synergy between the artifacts and creatures allows for explosive turns and the ability to quickly close out games. The inclusion of cards like Ethersworn Canonist and Spell Pierce helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Vault Skirge and Etched Champion provide additional resilience and protection. The mana base consists of artifact lands and creature lands to ensure smooth mana production for the aggressive strategy."
