            "notes": "The main concept of this Aggro Merfolk deck is to flood the board with Merfolk creatures and leverage their tribal synergies to quickly overwhelm the opponent. By using cards like Lord of Atlantis, Master of the Pearl Trident, and Merrow Reejerey, the deck gains powerful buffs and abilities that allow for efficient attacks. Additionally, disruptive spells like Dismember and Vapor Snag can help control the opponent's board while cards like Spreading Seas can disrupt their mana base. Aether Vial provides additional tempo advantage, allowing for quick creature deployments."
