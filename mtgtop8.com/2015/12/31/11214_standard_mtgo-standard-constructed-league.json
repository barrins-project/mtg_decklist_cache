By combining aggressive creatures with burn spells like Wild Slash and Exquisite Firecraft, the deck aims to maintain board presence and burn the opponent's life total down to zero as quickly as possible."

            "notes": "The main focus of this Orzhov Control deck is to control the board and out-value the opponent through a combination of removal spells, hand disruption, and powerful threats. The deck aims to control the game through efficient removal like Murderous Cut and Stasis Snare, while also generating card advantage with cards like Painful Truths and Hangarback Walker. By playing threats like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Wingmate Roc, the deck can pressure the opponent while still maintaining control of the game. The mana base is constructed to ensure consistency in both white and black sources for the powerful spells in the deck."
