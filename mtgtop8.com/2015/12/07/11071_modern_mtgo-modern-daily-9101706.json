By utilizing cards like Cranial Plating and Arcbound Ravager, along with the mana acceleration from Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, the deck can quickly amass a threatening board presence. Scale of Chiss-Goria helps to pump up creatures for additional damage, while Chalice of the Void disrupts opponents' strategies. Contested War Zone provides an additional boost to attacking creatures, ensuring a swift victory through a relentless assault."
