By playing low-cost spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, as well as creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to take advantage of its speed and consistent damage output to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Boros Charm and Atarka's Command also provide additional reach and versatility in dealing damage."
