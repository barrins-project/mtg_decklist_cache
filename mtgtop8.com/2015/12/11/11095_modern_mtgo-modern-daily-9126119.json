This mana is then used to cast powerful control cards like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn to dominate the board and control the game. The deck also includes cards like Wurmcoil Engine and Spellskite for protection, along with cards like Pyroclasm and Oblivion Stone for board control. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful threats and versatile answers."
