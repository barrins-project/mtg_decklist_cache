The goal is to assemble a lethal infect attack as soon as possible, overwhelming the opponent before they have a chance to react. The deck's mana base is designed to support this strategy, ensuring consistent access to the necessary colors and lands."

The synergy between cards like Arcbound Ravager, Steel Overseer, and Mox Opal allows for fast and explosive plays, while also providing protection with cards like Etched Champion and Vault Skirge. With a focus on quickly building a strong board presence and maximizing artifact synergies, this Aggro-Affinity deck aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

Then, using spells like Demonic Dread and Violent Outburst, the player cascades to cast Living End, which returns all creatures from the graveyard to the battlefield. This strategy is supported by cards like Street Wraith and Twisted Abomination for additional cycling, and Fulminator Mage and Beast Within for disruption and removal. The mana base is designed to support a variety of colors for casting and cycling."

Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish opponents for casting spells, while Atarka's Command and Boros Charm provide additional reach and versatility. The mana base is optimized for consistency and speed, using fetch lands to find the necessary colors of mana. Overall, the deck aims to win the game as quickly as possible through a combination of creature aggression and burn damage."
