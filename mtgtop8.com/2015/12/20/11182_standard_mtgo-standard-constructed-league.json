With a mix of powerful threats like Tasigur, the Golden Fang and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy, along with versatile commands like Ojutai's Command and Kolaghan's Command, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating incremental advantage through card advantage and creature tokens. By managing the board and resources effectively, it looks to stabilize and eventually close out the game with its threats and spells."
