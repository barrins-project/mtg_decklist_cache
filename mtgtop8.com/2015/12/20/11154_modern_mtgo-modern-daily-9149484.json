It aims to stabilize the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Detention Sphere, while also generating card advantage with cards like Cryptic Command and Jace, Architect of Thought. The deck utilizes a mix of white and blue mana sources to maximize its efficiency in handling threats and maintaining board presence. By combining control elements with midrange threats, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent in a 1 vs 1 setting."
