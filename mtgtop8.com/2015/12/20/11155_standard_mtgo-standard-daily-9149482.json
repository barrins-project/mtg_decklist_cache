The deck focuses on early game threats like Heir of the Wilds and Warden of the First Tree to put pressure on the opponent, while also utilizing cards like Siege Rhino and Wingmate Roc for added value and to close out the game. Additionally, the deck includes a mix of powerful planeswalkers like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and versatile removal spells like Abzan Charm and Dromoka's Command to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy."
