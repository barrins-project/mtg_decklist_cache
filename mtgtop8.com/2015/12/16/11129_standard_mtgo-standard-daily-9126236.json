With a mix of low-cost creatures and removal spells, it aims to establish a board presence early on and deal consistent damage to the opponent. The deck's strategy revolves around maintaining board control and using efficient removal spells to clear the way for creatures to attack. By playing aggressively and constantly applying pressure, it aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize their own game plan."
