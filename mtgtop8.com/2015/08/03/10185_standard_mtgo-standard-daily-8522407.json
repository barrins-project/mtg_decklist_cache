By equipping artifacts like Ghostfire Blade and Ensoul Artifact to creatures like Ornithopter and Hangarback Walker, as well as using cards like Springleaf Drum and Chief of the Foundry to boost their effectiveness, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle. Stubborn Denial provides protection against removal spells, while Shrapnel Blast can be used to finish off the opponent or remove threats."
