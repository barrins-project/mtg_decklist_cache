The deck also includes cards like Shrapnel Blast and Whirler Rogue to deal direct damage and create extra attackers. Stubborn Denial provides protection for your creatures, while Springleaf Drum helps with mana acceleration. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy centered around artifact creatures."
