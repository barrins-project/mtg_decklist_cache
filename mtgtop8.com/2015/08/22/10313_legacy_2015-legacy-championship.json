The inclusion of cards like Deathrite Shaman and Dig Through Time provide additional utility and flexibility, making the deck adaptable to various game situations."

            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and disruption. By utilizing a combination of efficient creatures like Delver of Secrets, Young Pyromancer, and Deathrite Shaman, along with powerful counterspells such as Force of Will and Daze, the deck aims to control the board while dealing damage quickly with burn spells like Lightning Bolt. The deck also includes card draw and selection with Ponder, Brainstorm, and Dig Through Time to ensure consistency in draws. Wasteland is used to disrupt the opponent's mana base and Stifle can be used to disrupt key abilities."
