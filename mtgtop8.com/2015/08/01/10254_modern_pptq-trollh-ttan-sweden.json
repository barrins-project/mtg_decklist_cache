The deck includes counter spells and removal to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, card draw and selection spells help to find the combo pieces and maintain card advantage. The overall strategy is to control the board while setting up the combo and then quickly close out the game once the combo is assembled."

By efficiently using burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Boros Charm, combined with fast creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to lower the opponent's life total as quickly as possible. Additionally, cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze help to control the board and limit the opponent's options. This deck prioritizes speed and consistency in order to win the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
