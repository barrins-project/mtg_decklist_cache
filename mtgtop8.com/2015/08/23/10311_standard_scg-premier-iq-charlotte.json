            "notes": "The deck is centered around early aggression and efficiently controlling the board to overwhelm the opponent. It utilizes powerful creatures such as Hangarback Walker, Fleecemane Lion, and Archangel of Tithes to quickly apply pressure, backed up by support from cards like Gods Willing and Dromoka's Command to protect key creatures. The deck also features a mix of powerful planeswalkers such as Ajani, Mentor of Heroes and Kytheon, Hero of Akros to generate additional value and close out games quickly. Overall, the deck aims to establish board dominance early on and maintain pressure throughout the game."
