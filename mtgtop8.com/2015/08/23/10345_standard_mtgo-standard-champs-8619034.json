The deck uses cards like Sphinx's Tutelage and Treasure Cruise to mill the opponent's library while drawing cards for yourself. Anger of the Gods and Roast help control the board, while Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Tormenting Voice provide additional card advantage. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by outdrawing them and milling their deck before they can mount a significant offense."
