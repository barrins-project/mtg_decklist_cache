Past in Flames allows for the deck to potentially recycle spells from the graveyard for another explosive turn."

Additionally, cards like Noble Hierarch and Wild Defiance provide support and added bonuses to boost your infect strategy even further. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm your opponent with poison counters before they can stop you."
