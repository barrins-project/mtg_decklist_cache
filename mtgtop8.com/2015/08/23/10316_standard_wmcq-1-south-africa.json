Cards like Thoughtseize and Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver can disrupt the opponent's hand while cards like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Perilous Vault can help reset the board if needed. The deck also includes some lifegain lands to help stabilize against aggressive decks."

By utilizing low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Eidolon of the Great Revel, along with burn spells such as Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames, the deck aims to reduce the opponent's life total as quickly as possible. Additional support comes from cards like Abbot of Keral Keeping and Exquisite Firecraft to maintain pressure on the opponent. Overall, the deck's strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and relentless assault."
