The inclusion of powerful win conditions like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Silumgar, the Drifting Death allows the deck to finish off the game once it has gained control. The mana base supports the deck's color requirements and provides access to powerful lands like Haven of the Spirit Dragon and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth."
