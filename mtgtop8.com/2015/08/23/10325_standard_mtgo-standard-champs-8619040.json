The deck also focuses on generating card advantage and efficiency through Courser of Kruphix and Den Protector, creating a versatile and resilient strategy that can adapt to various matchups and playstyles. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Nissa, Vastwood Seer provides additional late-game power and resilience to outlast opponents in longer games."
