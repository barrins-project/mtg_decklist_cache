            "notes": "This aggressive deck focuses on quickly deploying powerful dragon creatures to overwhelm the opponent. With plenty of mana ramp and burn spells to control the board, the key strategy is to efficiently play threats that can close out the game rapidly. By combining efficient creatures like Thunderbreak Regent and Stormbreath Dragon with removal spells like Magma Spray and Crater's Claws, this deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain tempo throughout the match. With a mix of mana acceleration and resilient threats, this deck looks to outpace opponents and secure victories through sheer aggression."
