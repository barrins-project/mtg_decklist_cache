These creatures are supported by removal spells like Abzan Charm, Dromoka's Command, and Hero's Downfall to control the opponent's board. The deck also includes Hangarback Walker for additional value and resilience. The mana base is optimized for consistency and includes a mix of lands to support the deck's three-color requirements. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient threats and versatile removal."
