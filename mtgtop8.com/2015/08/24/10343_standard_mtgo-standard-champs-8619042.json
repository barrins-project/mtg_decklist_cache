            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly dealing damage to the opponent with a combination of low-cost creatures and burn spells. By playing aggressive cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Foundry Street Denizen early on, followed by powerful burn spells like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a defense. Cards like Hordeling Outburst and Zurgo Bellstriker provide additional sources of damage, while Exquisite Firecraft serves as a strong finisher. The key strategy is to maintain pressure and close out the game swiftly."
