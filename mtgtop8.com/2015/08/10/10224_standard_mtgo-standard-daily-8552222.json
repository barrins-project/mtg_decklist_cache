It utilizes powerful dragon creatures like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Dragonlord Ojutai to win the game once the opponent's threats have been neutralized. With a mix of hand disruption, board wipes, and efficient removal, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain control of the board until it can establish a dominant position with its dragons."
