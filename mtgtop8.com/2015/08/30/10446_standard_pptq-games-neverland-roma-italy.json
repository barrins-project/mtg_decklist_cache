The deck aims to control the board early on with creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Abbot of Keral Keep, while also dealing direct damage with spells like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames. Eidolon of the Great Revel punishes the opponent for playing spells, creating further pressure. By maintaining a fast pace and overwhelming the opponent with damage, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
