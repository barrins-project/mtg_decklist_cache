The goal is to control the game by ramping up mana and putting out powerful creatures to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own board presence. Cards like Whisperwood Elemental provide additional value by generating token creatures and potentially generating card advantage. The deck aims to outpace and outvalue the opponent with its ramp and threat density."
