The deck also includes counterspells like Spell Pierce and Force of Will to protect the combo, as well as card draw and selection spells like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Dig Through Time to find the combo pieces. Cunning Wish adds versatility and options by allowing the player to tutor for specific cards from the sideboard. The mana base is designed to support the combo while providing the necessary colors of mana."

Additionally, the deck includes cards like Gitaxian Probe and Cabal Therapy to disrupt opponents' strategies and protect its own combo pieces."
