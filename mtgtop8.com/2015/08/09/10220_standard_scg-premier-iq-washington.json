By continually triggering heroic abilities, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and protection. Key cards such as Seeker of the Way, Favored Hoplite, and Hero of Iroas are essential to this strategy, while defensive spells like Gods Willing and Valorous Stance help to keep your creatures safe from removal spells. Ultimately, the goal is to create a fast, powerful board presence that can quickly close out the game."
