By utilizing cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to ramp into threats like Cranial Plating and Arcbound Ravager, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of evasive creatures and powerful synergies. The inclusion of cards like Steel Overseer and Master of Etherium further boost the power of the artifact creatures, while cards like Galvanic Blast provide reach to close out the game. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, aggressive, and resilient."
