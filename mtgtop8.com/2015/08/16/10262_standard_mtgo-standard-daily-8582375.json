By focusing on aggressive plays and using cards like Master of Waves and Ensoul Artifact to enhance the creatures' abilities, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own strategy. Thassa, God of the Sea provides additional utility and control options, while the inclusion of cards like Military Intelligence and Bident of Thassa help to maintain card advantage and pressure the opponent."

The goal is to out-value your opponent by drawing cards with spells like Jace's Ingenuity and Dig Through Time, while also disrupting your opponent's game plan with cards like Clash of Wills and Last Breath. By managing the board and outlasting your opponent's threats, you can eventually overpower them with your high impact cards."
