It also aims to disrupt the opponent's strategies with cards like Reclamation Sage and Scavenging Ooze while maintaining a fast and consistent combo win condition with cards like Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of Elves and powerful combo plays."
