The deck also includes disruption elements like Cursecatcher, Tidebinder Mage, and Dismember to control the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck runs Aether Vial and Spreading Seas to ramp up its aggression and disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient Merfolk army."

It aims to deal high amounts of damage quickly through creatures with evasion abilities and versatile removal spells like Galvanic Blast. The deck's key strength lies in its ability to quickly establish a threatening board presence and adapt to different situations by utilizing its creatures' abilities and the flexibility of its artifact-based cards."

The deck focuses on playing cheap creatures like Memnite, Ornithopter, and Signal Pest, and then using cards like Arcbound Ravager and Cranial Plating to boost their power and toughness. It also includes cards like Etched Champion and Spellskite for added protection. Additionally, the deck utilizes artifacts like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to generate mana and enable explosive turns. The lands in the deck, particularly the Nexus lands, provide additional utility and evasion."
