The deck also focuses on controlling the board with cards like Courser of Kruphix and Polukranos, World Eater, while generating card advantage with Whisperwood Elemental. Shaman of Forgotten Ways can provide an alternative win condition by activating its formidable ability. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful threats and mana advantage."
