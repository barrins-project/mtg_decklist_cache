With a low mana curve and a high concentration of cheap spells, the deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent and finish the game before they have a chance to stabilize. Cards like Exquisite Firecraft, Eidolon of the Great Revel, and Lightning Strike help to maintain the tempo and keep the pressure on, while creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Zurgo Bellstriker deliver consistent damage."
