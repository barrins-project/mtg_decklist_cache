The strategy revolves around utilizing cards like Sphinx's Tutelage and Tormenting Voice to draw cards and mill the opponent while using counter spells and removal like Anger of the Gods and Roast to control the board. Jace, Vryn's Prodigy serves as a key card for card advantage and graveyard manipulation. The deck aims to outlast opponents by maintaining control of the game and eventually overwhelming them with card advantage and disruption."
