By utilizing cards like Wild Slash, Stoke the Flames, and Lightning Strike, along with creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Rabblemaster, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Zurgo Bellstriker and Eidolon of the Great Revel adds additional pressure to the opponent, forcing them to react quickly or risk being overwhelmed."
