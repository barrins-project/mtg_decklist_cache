            "notes": "The main concept of this UWx Control deck is to maintain control of the game through a combination of countermagic, card advantage, and board control. The deck aims to control the opponent's threats with cards like Terminus, Swords to Plowshares, and Counterbalance while generating card advantage with Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Snapcaster Mage, and Dig Through Time. The deck also utilizes a combination of cantrips like Ponder and Brainstorm alongside Sensei's Divining Top to ensure consistency in drawing answers and threats. Additionally, the deck includes mana denial with cards like Wasteland and potentially Volcanic Island."
