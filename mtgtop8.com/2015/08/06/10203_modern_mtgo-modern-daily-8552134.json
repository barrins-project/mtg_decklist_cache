By efficiently generating mana with cards like Manamorphose and rituals, the deck can chain together a series of spells to generate a lethal storm count and finish the opponent off in one explosive turn. Past in Flames allows for the deck to recur key spells from the graveyard, ensuring that the combo can continue even after disruption from the opponent."
