            "notes": "The main concept of this UW Control deck is to maintain control over the game through counterspells, removal, and card advantage. By utilizing cards like Dissolve, Disdainful Stroke, and Ojutai's Command, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategies while digging through the library with cards like Dig Through Time and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy. The deck also includes win conditions like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, Elspeth, Sun's Champion, and Dragonlord Ojutai to close out the game once the opponent has been neutralized. The deck focuses on efficient and versatile answers to dominate the battlefield."
