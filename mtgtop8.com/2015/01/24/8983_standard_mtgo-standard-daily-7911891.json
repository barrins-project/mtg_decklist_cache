By playing a combination of cheap spells such as Defiant Strike and Gods Willing, you can pump up your Heroic creatures while also protecting them from removal. The goal is to quickly build up a board of powerful, evasive creatures like Favored Hoplite and Battlewise Hoplite to overwhelm your opponent and win the game through combat damage. The deck also includes some counter magic and lifegain spells to help protect and stabilize your board."
