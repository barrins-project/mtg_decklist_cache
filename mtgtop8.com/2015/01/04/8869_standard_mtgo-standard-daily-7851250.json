The deck focuses on playing powerful creatures with abilities that help protect themselves or generate value, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan using cards like Thoughtseize and Bile Blight. The deck aims to curve out smoothly into powerful finishers like Wingmate Roc and Sorin, Solemn Visitor, overwhelming the opponent with a mix of aggressive creatures and removal spells."
