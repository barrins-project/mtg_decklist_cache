The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan with counterspells and removal, while simultaneously developing its own board presence. It aims to control the early game with disruption and card selection, before transitioning into a more aggressive strategy once a threat like Stoneforge Mystic or True-Name Nemesis is deployed. The deck's mana base consists of fetchlands and dual lands to ensure consistent access to the colors needed for spells and creatures."
