This is achieved through a combination of powerful creatures such as Siege Rhino, Fleecemane Lion, and Courser of Kruphix, along with disruption cards like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Whip of Erebos and Eidolon of Blossoms to provide additional value and synergies. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of efficient threats and versatile removal, creating a strong and versatile aggressive strategy."
