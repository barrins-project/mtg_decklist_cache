It aims to stall the opponent's threats with cards like Mana Leak and Path to Exile, while gradually drawing into more powerful cards with Serum Visions and Compulsive Research. The deck also includes win conditions like Celestial Colonnade and Batterskull to close out games. The use of Snapcaster Mage allows for flexibility in reusing key spells from the graveyard, making it a versatile and adaptable control deck."
