By utilizing creatures like Siege Rhino and Courser of Kruphix to gain life and generate card advantage, as well as cards like Hero's Downfall and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. With a mix of aggression and resilience, this Aggro-Abzan deck aims to win games through a combination of early pressure and mid-game dominance."

Along with cards like Arbor Colossus and Hornet Queen, this deck aims to control the board and overwhelm your opponent with powerful creatures. Support cards like Whip of Erebos and Soul of New Phyrexia provide additional utility and resilience.
