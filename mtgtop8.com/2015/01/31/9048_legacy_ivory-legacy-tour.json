With Liliana of the Veil and Smallpox to control the board, the deck aims to grind out a victory by stripping the opponent's hand and resources. With the combo of Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage, the deck also has a powerful win condition in the form of a 20/20 Marit Lage token. The deck utilizes land recursion and resource denial to outvalue and outlast the opponent in a grindy game."
