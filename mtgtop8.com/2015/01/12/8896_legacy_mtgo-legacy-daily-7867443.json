            "notes": "The primary concept of this deck is to control the game through a combination of stall tactics, removal spells, and countermagic while also generating advantage through card draw and token generation. By using cards like Stoneforge Mystic to search for powerful equipment like Batterskull or Umezawa's Jitte, the deck can stabilize the board and shift the momentum in its favor. With access to powerful creatures like True-Name Nemesis and Young Pyromancer, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents while maintaining a strong defensive position through efficient removal spells and disruptive countermagic."
