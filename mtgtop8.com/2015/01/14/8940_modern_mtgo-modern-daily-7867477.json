It also utilizes efficient card draw and removal spells to maintain tempo and control the board. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive offense while leveraging the synergy between artifact creatures and equipment. The inclusion of versatile lands like Blinkmoth Nexus and Inkmoth Nexus allows for additional flexibility in attacking and defending."
