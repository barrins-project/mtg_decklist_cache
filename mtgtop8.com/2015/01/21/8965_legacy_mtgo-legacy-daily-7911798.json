This allows the player to put Enter the Infinite onto the battlefield, drawing their entire deck. From there, they can use Omniscience to cast any spell for free. The deck includes various cantrips and countermagic to find and protect the combo, as well as Ancient Tomb and City of Traitors to generate additional mana."
