The creatures in the deck, such as Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, also contribute to this strategy by attacking the opponent directly and applying pressure. The overall goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and consistent damage, while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Boros Charm."
