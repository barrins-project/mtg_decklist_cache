Price of Progress and Fireblast can also be used to deal significant damage and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

The deck also includes cards like Blood Moon and Magus of the Moon to disrupt the opponent's mana base, as well as cards like Ensnaring Bridge to protect against aggressive strategies. With the ability to search for combo pieces using cards like Imperial Recruiter and Enlightened Tutor, this deck aims to quickly assemble its win condition and lock down the game before the opponent can respond effectively."
