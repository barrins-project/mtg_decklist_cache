The key strategy is to quickly ramp into impactful threats like Siege Rhino and Wingmate Roc, backed up by efficient removal options like Abzan Charm and Hero's Downfall to keep the opponent on the back foot. The inclusion of Lifelink abilities from cards like Sorin, Solemn Visitor and Whip of Erebos can help stabilize against aggressive decks while maintaining pressure on slower opponents. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a strong and efficient creature base backed by versatile removal options."
