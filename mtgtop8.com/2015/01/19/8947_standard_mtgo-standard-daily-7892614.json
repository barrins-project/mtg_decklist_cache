By playing low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Firedrinker Satyr, and supporting them with pump spells like Dragon Mantle and Titan's Strength, you can deal damage quickly and efficiently. Cards like Coordinated Assault and Frenzied Goblin help to push through blockers, while burn spells like Stoke the Flames and Lightning Strike provide additional reach to finish off your opponent. This deck aims to win the game as quickly as possible through aggressive creature attacks and direct damage."
