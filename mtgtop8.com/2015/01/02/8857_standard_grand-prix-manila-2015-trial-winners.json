By filling the graveyard with cards like Courser of Kruphix and Sidisi, Brood Tyrant, the deck can efficiently ramp up and generate card advantage. The inclusion of cards like Hornet Queen and Doomwake Giant provide strong threats on the battlefield, while cards like Whip of Erebos and Soul of Innistrad help to recur creatures and maintain pressure. Thoughtseize and removal spells like Murderous Cut and Hero's Downfall help to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
