The deck also includes hand disruption with cards like Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base is designed to support the three-color combination of green, white, and black with lands like Sandsteppe Citadel and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient threats and disrupt their strategy to secure victory."
