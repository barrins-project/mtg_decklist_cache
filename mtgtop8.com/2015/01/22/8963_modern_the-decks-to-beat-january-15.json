The deck is designed to be fast and aggressive, overwhelming the opponent with a combination of artifact synergy and aggressive creatures. Key cards like Arcbound Ravager and Steel Overseer help to further enhance the power of the artifacts on the battlefield, while cards like Etched Champion provide protection for the key pieces of the deck."

This mana is then used to cast powerful colorless spells and creatures like Karn Liberated, Wurmcoil Engine, and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn. The deck also includes cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to help find the UrzaTron lands consistently. Additionally, there are cards like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus for control and disruption to outlast opponents."
