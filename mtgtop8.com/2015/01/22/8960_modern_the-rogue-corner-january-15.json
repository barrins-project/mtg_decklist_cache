The deck also includes various artifacts like Chromatic Sphere, Mox Opal, and Lotus Bloom to help filter and ramp up mana production. By utilizing these cards in combination with sacrificing artifacts and drawing cards, the deck is able to quickly assemble its combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with a big explosive turn."
