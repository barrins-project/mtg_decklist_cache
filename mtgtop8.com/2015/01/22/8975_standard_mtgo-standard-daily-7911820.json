The deck also focuses on disruption with cards like Thoughtseize and Abzan Charm to control the opponent's resources. Additionally, the deck includes powerful planeswalkers like Ajani, Mentor of Heroes and Elspeth, Sun's Champion to provide board presence and generate advantage. The mana base is built to support the three-color requirement of the deck while including utility lands like Caves of Koilos and Temple of Malady for additional flexibility."
