By utilizing card draw, graveyard interaction, and cheap removal, the deck aims to maintain a fast pace and overwhelm the opponent with a mix of creatures and burn spells. The key is to deploy threats early, disrupt the opponent's strategy, and close out the game before they can stabilize. Additionally, the deck has a strong mana base to support its color requirements and maximize its potential in aggressive matchups."
