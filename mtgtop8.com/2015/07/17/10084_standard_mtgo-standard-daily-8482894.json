The deck aims to control the game by generating a large amount of mana through cards like Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Courser of Kruphix, allowing the player to overwhelm their opponent with powerful creatures and steadily increasing board presence. The inclusion of cards like Deathmist Raptor and Genesis Hydra provide additional value and potential card advantage in longer games."
