It also has a strong card advantage engine with Snapcaster Mage and Vendilion Clique. The mana base is designed to support both the control elements and the midrange threats, with Celestial Colonnade being a key win condition. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent and disrupt their game plan while presenting a fast clock with evasive threats."
