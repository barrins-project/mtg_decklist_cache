This ensures a fast-paced gameplay where the opponent's life total diminishes rapidly. The inclusion of cards like Call of the Full Moon and Titan's Strength helps increase the damage output of the creatures, while cards like Flamewake Phoenix provide additional reach. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
