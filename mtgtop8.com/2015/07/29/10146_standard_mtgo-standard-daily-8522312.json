The deck aims to control the board with creatures like Siege Rhino and Den Protector, eventually overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The inclusion of cards like Deathmist Raptor and End Hostilities provide additional resilience and control options, making it a versatile and aggressive deck."
