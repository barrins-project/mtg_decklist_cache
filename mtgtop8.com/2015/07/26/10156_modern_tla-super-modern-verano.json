The deck also includes ramp cards like Manamorphose and Simian Spirit Guide to accelerate the game plan.

It also includes control elements such as Remand, Cryptic Command, and Snapcaster Mage to disrupt the opponent's game plan while digging for combo pieces. With efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Roast, along with card draw and counterspells, the deck aims to protect the combo until it can be executed for a game-winning play."
