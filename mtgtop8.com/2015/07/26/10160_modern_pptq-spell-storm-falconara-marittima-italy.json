The deck also utilizes cards like Oblivion Stone and Wurmcoil Engine for board control and stabilization, while also using cards like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to find the UrzaTron lands quickly. The deck aims to control the game with its large threats and efficient removal spells until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful late-game threats."
