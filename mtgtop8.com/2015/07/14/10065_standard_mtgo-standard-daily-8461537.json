Collected Company is used to dig for creatures and put them directly onto the battlefield, while cards like Den Protector and Courser of Kruphix provide card advantage and resilience. Aspect of Hydra can be used as a finisher, pumping up your creatures for a lethal attack. The deck focuses on controlling the game with powerful creatures and overwhelming board presence."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while gradually building up its own board presence and card advantage to eventually win the game. By utilizing cards like Silumgar's Scorn, Hero's Downfall, and Dig Through Time, the deck can answer threats efficiently and protect its own win conditions. The dragons, especially Dragonlord Ojutai and Dragonlord Silumgar, serve as both threats and ways to close out the game once control has been established."
