The deck also includes removal spells like Draconic Roar and Foul-Tongue Invocation for board control. The inclusion of powerful dragons like Stormbreath Dragon and Thunderbreak Regent provides additional threats and finishers. Kolaghan's Command serves as versatile removal and disruption, while Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury helps pump up the team for a final push. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, efficient, and relentless in its aggression."
