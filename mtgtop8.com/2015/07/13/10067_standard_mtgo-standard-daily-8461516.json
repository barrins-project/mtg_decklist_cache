Elspeth, Sun's Champion provides a powerful finisher, and Tasigur, the Golden Fang offers card advantage and a threat that can be brought back with Den Protector. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure while maintaining card advantage and control of the game."

The deck aims to apply pressure early with cards like Soulfire Grand Master and Goblin Rabblemaster, while also having the ability to control the board with cards like Valorous Stance and Ojutai's Command. By utilizing a mix of damage spells like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames, along with powerful creatures like Mantis Rider and Dragonlord Ojutai, this deck aims to close out games quickly and efficiently."
