It utilizes cards like Hero's Downfall and Thoughtseize to control the board, while also incorporating card draw and counterspells to maintain advantage. The deck aims to play a long game, using strong finishers like Dragonlord Ojutai and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to close out the match. By combining removal, counters, and powerful threats, this deck looks to outvalue and outlast the opponent in a battle of attrition."
