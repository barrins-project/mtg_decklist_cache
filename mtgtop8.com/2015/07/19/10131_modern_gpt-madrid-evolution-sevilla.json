            "notes": "The main idea behind this modern 1 vs 1 aggro red deck is to quickly and efficiently deal damage to the opponent by utilizing a plethora of burn spells and aggressive creatures. The deck aims to keep the pressure on the opponent by consistently casting direct damage spells like Lava Spike, Lightning Bolt, and Rift Bolt, while also utilizing fast creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide to further chip away at the opponent's life total. The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan and prevent them from gaining life or stabilizing. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of damage, while also having some flexibility with cards like Boros Charm and Lightning Helix to help close out the game. The mana base is constructed to support the aggressive strategy, with fetch lands like Bloodstained Mire and Wooded Foothills helping to ensure the deck has access to the necessary colors of mana."

By utilizing cards like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to pump up the team, along with Aether Vial for extra creature deployment, the goal is to quickly establish a threatening board presence. Spreading Seas disrupts the opponent's mana base and the inclusion of counterspells like Cursecatcher and Harbinger of the Tides help control the game. Master of Waves can provide a massive army of Elemental tokens to finish off the opponent."
