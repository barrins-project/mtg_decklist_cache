The deck aims to control the board with cards like Swords to Plowshares and Mother of Runes, while also having access to equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Sword of Fire and Ice for additional value. Overall, the deck seeks to outmaneuver the opponent through a combination of disruption and efficient creatures."
