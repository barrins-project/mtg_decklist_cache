            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to assemble Urza lands (Urza's Tower, Urza's Power Plant, Urza's Mine) in order to generate a large amount of colorless mana. This mana is used to play powerful threat cards such as Wurmcoil Engine, Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Karn Liberated. The deck also includes control elements like Pyroclasm, Oblivion Stone, and Spellskite to disrupt opponents and protect its own threats. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with high-impact threats while controlling the game with removal and disruption spells."
