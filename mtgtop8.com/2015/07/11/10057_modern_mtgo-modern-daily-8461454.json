The deck also includes Phyrexian Unlife to protect against losing the game due to damage and Pact of Negation as backup protection against disruption. The inclusion of Lotus Bloom allows for explosive mana acceleration, while cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Pentad Prism provide additional mana sources for the combo to go off smoothly."

The main win conditions are Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, with backup threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre. The deck also includes ways to find the UrzaTron lands consistently, as well as board wipes and graveyard hate to control the game and disrupt opponents' strategies."

With a mix of powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Chandra, Pyromaster, alongside strong creatures like Tarmogoyf and Olivia Voldaren, the deck aims to take advantage of its versatile removal suite and hand disruption spells to disrupt opponents' game plans while applying steady damage. The key idea is to keep the opponent on the back foot while building a strong board presence to close out the game quickly."
