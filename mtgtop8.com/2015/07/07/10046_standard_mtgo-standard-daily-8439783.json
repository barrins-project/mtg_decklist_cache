The deck also aims to generate card advantage and resilience through cards like Den Protector and Satyr Wayfinder. Additionally, disruption and removal spells such as Thoughtseize, Abzan Charm, and Hero's Downfall help control the opponent's board while providing flexibility in different situations. The inclusion of powerful planeswalker Elspeth, Sun's Champion and other finishers like Wingmate Roc ensure that the deck can close out games quickly."
