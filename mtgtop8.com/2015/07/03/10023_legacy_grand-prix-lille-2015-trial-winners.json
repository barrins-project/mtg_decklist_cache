The deck also includes hate cards like Phyrexian Revoker and Magus of the Moon to disrupt specific strategies, making it difficult for the opponent to effectively execute their game plan.

It utilizes powerful cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and Counterbalance to stay ahead in the game. Sensei's Divining Top allows for manipulation of the top of the library, helping to ensure that the player can counter important spells. The deck also includes threats like Vendilion Clique and Snapcaster Mage to apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's control strategy."
