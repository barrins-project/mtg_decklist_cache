The deck aims to use Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play, while also utilizing Lords of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to pump up the Merfolk army. Spreading Seas helps to disrupt the opponent's mana base, while cards like Kira, Great Glass-Spinner provide protection for key creatures. Ultimately, the goal is to outpace the opponent and deal damage quickly."

By using cards like Daybreak Coronet, Ethereal Armor, and Rancor, the deck aims to quickly pump up its creatures and go on the offensive, while also using protection spells like Spirit Link and Hyena Umbra to maintain board control and protect its creatures from removal. Overall, this deck focuses on overwhelming the opponent with hard-to-remove threats and quickly closing out the game."
