The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon provide additional threats and card advantage. The use of Abzan Charm and Bile Blight allows for versatility in dealing with various threats. The mana base is designed to support the three-color combination of Abzan by including lands like Sandsteppe Citadel and Temple of Malady."
