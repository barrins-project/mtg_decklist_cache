This allows for powerful combos with cards like Bridge from Below and Narcomoeba, overwhelming the opponent with tokens and recursive threats. The deck also includes disruption with cards like Chalice of the Void and Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Force of Will and Mindbreak Trap provide additional protection. The goal is to quickly assemble the combo and overwhelmed the opponent before they can respond effectively."
