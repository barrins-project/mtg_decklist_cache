It aims to end the game as quickly as possible by utilizing pump spells like Titan's Strength and Become Immense to deal massive amounts of damage. Atarka's Command provides additional reach and utility, while key creatures like Snapping Gnarlid and Den Protector help maintain momentum. The mana base is designed to support a fast, consistent start to overwhelm opponents before they can stabilize."
