            "notes": "The main concept of the deck is to quickly establish a strong board presence and put pressure on the opponent through a combination of efficient creatures and removal spells. By playing aggressive creatures like Siege Rhino and Hangarback Walker, along with disruptive spells like Silkwrap and Abzan Charm, the deck aims to control the battlefield and lower the opponent's life total as quickly as possible. The addition of powerful planeswalkers like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and versatile cards like Den Protector allows for flexibility in adapting to different matchups and strategies."
