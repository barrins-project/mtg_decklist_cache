Cards like Sulfuric Vortex and Price of Progress help to punish opponents for playing non-basic lands.

The deck also utilizes powerful equipment cards (Umezawa's Jitte, Batterskull) to provide additional threats and increase its ability to control the game. The inclusion of Stoneforge Mystic allows for easy access to these equipment cards, while True-Name Nemesis provides a strong and difficult-to-answer finisher. Additionally, the mana base includes a variety of dual lands to ensure consistency in casting spells."
