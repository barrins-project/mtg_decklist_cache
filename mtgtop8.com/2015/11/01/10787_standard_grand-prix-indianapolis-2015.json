It focuses on using a variety of counterspells, removal spells, and planeswalkers to control the board state and outvalue the opponent. By having a mix of instant-speed removal, card draw, and counters, this deck is designed to maintain control throughout the game and eventually win through card advantage and powerful planeswalker abilities. The mana base is built to support the Esper color combination and ensure consistent access to all three colors of mana."
