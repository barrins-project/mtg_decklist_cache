            "notes": "This deck focuses on using green ramp cards to quickly get to large amounts of mana and playing powerful high-cost creatures like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, Dragonlord Atarka, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The key strategy is to control the game by casting powerful spells ahead of schedule, overwhelming the opponent with big threats before they have a chance to respond. The deck uses cards like Shrine of the Forsaken Gods and Explosive Vegetation to accelerate mana production, allowing for the early deployment of game-ending threats."
