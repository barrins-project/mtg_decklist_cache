The goal is to quickly build a board presence, apply pressure, and disrupt the opponent with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile. Collected Company provides additional creature support and helps refill the board if needed. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive strategy while still maintaining some flexibility and resilience through its diverse creature base and removal suite."
