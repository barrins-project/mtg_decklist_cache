By maintaining board presence with creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Thunderbreak Regent, while also using burn spells like Wild Slash and Exquisite Firecraft to remove blockers or finish off the opponent, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. Cards like Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker provide additional reach and powerful late-game threats to close out the game."
