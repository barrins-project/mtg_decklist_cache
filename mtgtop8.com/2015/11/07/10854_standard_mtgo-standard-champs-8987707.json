The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Silkwrap and Murderous Cut while also generating card advantage with cards like Den Protector. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Wingmate Roc provide additional threats and ways to close out the game quickly. The deck's mana base is designed to support its three-color combination efficiently."
