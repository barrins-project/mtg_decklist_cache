The deck includes a mix of powerful dragons like Dragonlord Ojutai and Silumgar, the Drifting Death, alongside counterspells like Silumgar's Scorn and Scatter to the Winds. The goal is to manage the board state with removal spells like Languish and Foul-Tongue Invocation, while utilizing card draw with Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Dig Through Time. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by efficiently controlling the game and outlasting them with powerful threats."
