It also includes disruption and removal spells like Abzan Charm, Dromoka's Command, and Murderous Cut to control the board and protect its creatures. The addition of planeswalkers like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar adds another threat to the board while Wingmate Roc provides additional creatures and flying pressure. The mana base is designed to support the three colors of the deck efficiently."
