The deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent with aggressive plays and combat tricks like Abzan Charm and Dromoka's Command. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent access to all necessary resources. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a relentless assault of creatures and removal spells."
