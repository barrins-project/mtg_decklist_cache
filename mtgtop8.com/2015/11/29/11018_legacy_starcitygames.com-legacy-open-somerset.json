The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Force of Will and Counterbalance, while efficiently answering threats with removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Terminus. The deck also has the ability to generate a winning condition through cards like Entreat the Angels, while maintaining card selection and library manipulation with cards like Brainstorm and Sensei's Divining Top."
