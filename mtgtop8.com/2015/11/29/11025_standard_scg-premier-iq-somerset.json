By combining creatures like Abbot of Keral Keep and powerful pump spells like Become Immense, the deck can quickly build a threatening board presence and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."

The mana base is built to support the control elements of the deck, allowing for flexibility in casting spells and activating abilities.

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and spells, using burn spells like Wild Slash and Exquisite Firecraft to control the board and finish off the opponent. This is supported by powerful creatures like Thunderbreak Regent and Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury to deal massive damage. The deck aims to apply early pressure and close out the game swiftly before the opponent can stabilize. The mana base is built to support the aggressive playstyle, ensuring consistent access to the necessary colors of mana."
