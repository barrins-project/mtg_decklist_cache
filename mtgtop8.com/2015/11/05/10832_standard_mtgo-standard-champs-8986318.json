It also includes versatile removal spells like Abzan Charm and Dromoka's Command to maintain board control. The deck aims to establish an early board presence with creatures and planeswalkers like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, while utilizing efficient mana fixing and land support with lands like Shambling Vent and Wooded Foothills. The overall strategy is to overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures and versatile spells to secure a quick victory."
