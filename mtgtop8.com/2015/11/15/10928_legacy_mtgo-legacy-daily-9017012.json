            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly fill up the graveyard with Dredge cards like Stinkweed Imp and Golgari Grave-Troll. By using cards like Faithless Looting and Careful Study, the player can draw and discard these Dredge cards to trigger their effects and bring back creatures like Narcomoeba and Ichorid. This allows the player to swarm the board with creatures and generate tokens from Bridge from Below, ultimately overwhelming their opponent with a powerful combo strategy. The deck utilizes Mana Confluence, Gemstone Mine, and City of Brass to fix mana and ensure consistent graveyard filling."
