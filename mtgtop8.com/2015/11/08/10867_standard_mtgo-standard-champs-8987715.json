Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides additional support and creates threats on the board. The deck also has removal options with cards like Dromoka's Command, Abzan Charm, and Murderous Cut. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient aggressive strategy while still having the tools to deal with threats."
