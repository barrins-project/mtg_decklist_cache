The goal is to quickly deploy threats such as Siege Rhino, Anafenza, and Gideon to apply pressure on the opponent while utilizing cards like Den Protector and Dromoka's Command to disrupt their game plan. The deck also features a flexible mana base to ensure consistent performance and the ability to adapt to various matchups. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and powerful offense."
