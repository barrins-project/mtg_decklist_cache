The deck also includes strong spells like Abzan Charm and Dromoka's Command to control the board and protect your creatures. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides a constant threat with his tokens, while Anafenza, the Foremost synergizes well with the creatures in the deck. The mana base is designed to support the three-color combination efficiently, ensuring that you can play your spells on curve and maintain a strong board presence throughout the game."
