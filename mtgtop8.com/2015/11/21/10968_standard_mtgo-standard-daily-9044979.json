            "notes": "The deck focuses on deploying a wide variety of threats at a fast pace, supported by removal and combat tricks to control the board. The key strategy is to curve out efficiently, starting with early aggressive creatures like Snapping Gnarlid and Warden of the First Tree, then transitioning into powerful midrange threats like Siege Rhino and Anafenza, the Foremost. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides additional threats and buffs, while Dromoka's Command and Abzan Charm offer versatile removal and combat tricks. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of speed, power, and flexibility."
