By using efficient one-drop creatures like Experiment One and Kird Ape, along with powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Burning-Tree Emissary, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Atarka's Command provides additional reach and versatility, while Lightning Bolt and Vexing Devil can help deal with opposing threats or push through the final points of damage. The mana base is tuned to provide consistent access to all of the deck's colors for maximum efficiency."
