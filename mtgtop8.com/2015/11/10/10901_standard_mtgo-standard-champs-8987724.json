The deck also includes removal spells like Abzan Charm and Dromoka's Command to maintain board control. The deck aims to quickly deploy threats and apply pressure to the opponent, while also having some protection and recursion with Den Protector. Additionally, the inclusion of a few versatile spells and lands allows for flexibility and adaptability in different situations."
