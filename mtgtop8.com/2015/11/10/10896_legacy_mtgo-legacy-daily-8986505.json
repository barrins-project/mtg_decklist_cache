            "notes": "The main concept of the deck is to establish control of the game through a combination of powerful control spells like Force of Will and Swords to Plowshares, alongside powerful card selection tools like Brainstorm and Ponder. The deck aims to control the board using cards like Terminus and Council's Judgment, while also generating card advantage with Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The inclusion of Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top creates a lock on the opponent's spells, making it difficult for them to resolve their threats. The deck's mana base supports its strategy of controlling the game and out valuing the opponent."
