By utilizing pump spells like Titan's Strength and Become Immense, as well as combat enhancers like Atarka's Command and Temur Battle Rage, the deck aims to deal large amounts of damage in a short amount of time. The inclusion of Den Protector and Abbot of Keral Keep allows for card advantage and resilience against removal. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to the necessary colors for casting spells."
