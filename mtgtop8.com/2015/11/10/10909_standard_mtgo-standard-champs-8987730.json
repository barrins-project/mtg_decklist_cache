The deck focuses on dealing damage as fast as possible by utilizing cheap, efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Zurgo Bellstriker, backed up by burn spells like Wild Slash and Atarka's Command. The deck also has ways to pump up its creatures with cards like Titan's Strength and Temur Battle Rage, ensuring that it can deal with threats and close out games quickly. The mana base is streamlined to support the aggressive nature of the deck."
