            "notes": "This Abzan Aggro deck focuses on aggressive creatures and a mix of removal and combat tricks to overwhelm the opponent. The key idea is to establish a strong board presence early on with efficient threats like Anafenza, Siege Rhino, and Hangarback Walker, supported by powerful planeswalkers like Gideon. The deck also includes versatile spells like Abzan Charm and Dromoka's Command to control the board and protect its creatures. By applying constant pressure and maintaining board control, the deck aims to outvalue and outpace the opponent to secure victory."
