By deploying threats such as Anafenza, Arashin Foremost, and Warden of the First Tree early on, it aims to quickly build a board presence and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The deck also includes cards like Collected Company and Abzan Charm to provide additional utility and flexibility in combat situations. Overall, the strategy revolves around aggressive plays and leveraging the strength of the Abzan color combination."
