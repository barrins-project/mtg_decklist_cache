            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly ramp up mana using green sources and utility lands, while also controlling the board with cards like Jaddi Offshoot and Hangarback Walker. The deck aims to reach high amounts of mana to cast powerful spells like The Great Aurora and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. In addition, cards like Nissa's Renewal and Explosive Vegetation help to further accelerate mana production. Ugin, the Spirit Dragon serves as a powerful late-game threat and board wipe option. Retreat to Kazandu provides additional life gain and landfall triggers for added value."
