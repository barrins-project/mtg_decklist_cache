The deck aims to apply early pressure with evasive threats and card advantage from Ninjutsu triggers, while maintaining a strong counter spell package to protect its creatures. The inclusion of card draw spells like Ponder and Preordain help ensure consistent draws and selection of key cards, while also maintaining a high land count to support the game plan."
