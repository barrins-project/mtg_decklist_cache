It aims to answer every threat the opponent plays while gaining incremental advantages through card advantage and versatility. The mana base is optimized to have the right colors available at all times and allows for quick fetching of necessary lands. It is a reactive deck that can adapt to different strategies and win through attrition and careful resource management."

Thought Scour, Serum Visions, and Sleight of Hand help dig through the deck for key combo pieces, with Past in Flames allowing for spell recursion. The deck aims to ultimately win by casting a large Grapeshot to deal lethal damage to the opponent in a single turn."
