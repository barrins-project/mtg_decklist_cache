By utilizing cards like Splinter Twin and Lightning Bolt to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan, the deck seeks to win by overwhelming the opponent with aggressive plays and tempo swings. The inclusion of counterspells like Remand and Dispel, as well as card advantage from Snapcaster Mage and Serum Visions, helps the deck maintain momentum and protect its key combo pieces."
