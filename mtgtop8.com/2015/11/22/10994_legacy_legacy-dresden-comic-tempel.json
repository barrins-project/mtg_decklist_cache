By using cards like Fireblast, Price of Progress, and Sulfuric Vortex, the deck aims to deal damage directly to the opponent to close out the game as fast as possible. With a low mana curve and efficient creatures like Goblin Guide and Grim Lavamancer, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with damage before they have a chance to stabilize."
