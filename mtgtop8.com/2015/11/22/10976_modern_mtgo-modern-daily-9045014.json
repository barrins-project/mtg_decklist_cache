            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to disrupt and control the opponent's strategy by using a combination of hand disruption, targeted removal, and artifacts that allow you to manipulate the top of their library. By utilizing cards like Lantern of Insight, Codex Shredder, and Ghoulcaller's Bell, you can control what cards your opponent draws and prevent them from executing their game plan effectively. The deck aims to lock down the board with cards like Ensnaring Bridge while gradually grinding out a win condition through attrition and resource denial."
