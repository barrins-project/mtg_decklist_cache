The strategy revolves around quickly building a board presence with cards like Arcbound Ravager and Signal Pest while using cards like Steel Overseer to boost their power. Etched Champion and Spellskite provide protection against removal spells, and Galvanic Blast serves as a versatile removal and reach spell. The deck's mana base consists of artifact lands and mana-producing creatures to ensure a consistent flow of mana."
