The deck utilizes a diverse mana base to cast its spells while also incorporating versatile planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to further control the game.

Additionally, the deck includes cards like Brain Freeze and Snapcaster+Mage','','');\"&gt;<a href=\"#\">Snapcaster Mage</a> to take advantage of the high mana count and potentially mill the opponent's library.
