By utilizing pump spells like Groundswell, Become Immense, and Might of Old Krosa, as well as protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing, you can surprise your opponent and win the game in just a few turns. Wild Defiance also helps to boost your infect creatures and make them more resilient. Overall, the key strategy of this deck is to assemble the combo pieces and deal lethal poison damage before your opponent can react."
