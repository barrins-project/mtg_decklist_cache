By utilizing cards like Gurmag Angler and Putrid Leech alongside cards like Flame Slash and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to control the board while still applying pressure. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Phyrexian Rager and Satyr Wayfinder help to filter through the deck and provide card advantage. The deck also includes some land destruction with cards like Terminate and Chainer's Edict to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
