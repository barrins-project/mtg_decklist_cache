The deck focuses on card advantage and recurring key cards like Punishing Fire and Life from the Loam to control the game flow and outvalue the opponent. Additionally, cards like Maze of Ith and Glacial Chasm provide protection and stall tactics to buy time for the deck to assemble its win conditions."
