By utilizing cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Leonin Arbiter to tax the opponent's resources, as well as cards like Blade Splicer and Mirran Crusader to present a clock, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while closing out games quickly. The use of Aether Vial allows for instant speed creature deployment, creating unexpected plays and keeping the opponent off balance."
