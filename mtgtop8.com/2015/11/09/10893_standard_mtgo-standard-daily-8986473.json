It aims to stall the opponent's threats while gradually building card advantage through card selection and powerful spells like Dig Through Time. The mana base is carefully designed to support the high number of double-color requirements in the spells. The Planeswalker cards, Narset Transcendent and Ob Nixilis Reignited, provide additional card advantage and utility. Overall, the deck's goal is to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
