By using counterspells, removal spells, and card draw, the deck aims to stall the game until it can play its dragon threats like Dragonlord Ojutai and Silumgar, the Drifting Death. The deck also includes versatile spells like Utter End and Dig Through Time to handle a variety of threats. Overall, the deck focuses on maintaining control of the game and winning through powerful dragon creatures."
