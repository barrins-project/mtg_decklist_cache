The deck aims to quickly build up a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of early aggression and late-game card advantage. Cards like Jeskai Ascendancy and Treasure Cruise provide additional value and card selection, while cards like Hordeling Outburst and Seeker of the Way capitalize on the aggressive nature of the deck. Dragonlord Ojutai serves as a late-game powerhouse to seal the deal."
