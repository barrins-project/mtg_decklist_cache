By casting rituals and generating mana efficiently with Goblin Electromancer, the deck aims to eventually chain together a large number of spells in a single turn, utilizing Past in Flames to recur spells from the graveyard and finish off the opponent with a lethal Grapeshot. The deck's success relies on carefully sequencing spells and managing resources to ensure a successful storm combo."
