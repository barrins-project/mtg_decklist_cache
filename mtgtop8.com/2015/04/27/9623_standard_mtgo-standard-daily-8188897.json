The deck also focuses on generating card advantage through Courser of Kruphix and Whisperwood Elemental, while using Mastery of the Unseen to create an army of manifest creatures. The combination of ramp and control elements allows the deck to overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures and card advantage."
