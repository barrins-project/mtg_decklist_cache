The key concept revolves around establishing an early board presence with lords such as Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident, while using disruptive elements like Cursecatcher and Spell Pierce to control the opponent's game plan. By maximizing the synergy between Merfolk creatures and leveraging cards like Aether Vial and Spreading Seas, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out the game swiftly."
