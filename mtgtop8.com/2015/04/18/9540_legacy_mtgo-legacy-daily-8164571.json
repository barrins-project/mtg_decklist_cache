The deck also includes removal spells like Abrupt Decay and counterspells like Force of Will to handle threats efficiently. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and control, while Ancestral Vision helps refill the hand. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and provide flexibility for casting spells."
