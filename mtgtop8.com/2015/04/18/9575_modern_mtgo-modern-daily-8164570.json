The key strategy is to put auras on creatures with hexproof to make them extremely difficult to remove while dealing significant damage to the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and efficient aura-based synergies to quickly finish the game before the opponent can stabilize. It capitalizes on the synergy between hexproof creatures and powerful auras to create a strong and aggressive deck."
