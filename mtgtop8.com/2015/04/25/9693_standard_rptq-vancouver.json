This is achieved through a combination of counter spells like Silumgar's Scorn and Dissolve, removal spells like Bile Blight and Hero's Downfall, and card draw spells like Dig Through Time and Anticipate. The deck also includes powerful board wipes like Crux of Fate and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to further control the battlefield. The mana base is designed to support the three-color mana requirements of the deck."
