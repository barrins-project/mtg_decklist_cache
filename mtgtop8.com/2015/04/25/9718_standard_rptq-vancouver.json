The deck also includes control elements like Den Protector and Dromoka's Command to deal with threats and disrupt the opponent's strategy.

The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Thoughtseize and Foul-Tongue Invocation, while also deploying threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Goblin Rabblemaster to quickly close out the game. By combining removal, card advantage with Outpost Siege, and efficient creatures, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent in a 1 vs 1 match-up."
