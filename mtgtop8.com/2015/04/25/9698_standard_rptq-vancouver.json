The inclusion of powerful creatures like Dragonlord Ojutai and Den Protector ensures that the deck has strong late-game options as well. The combination of aggressive threats and card advantage makes this deck a formidable opponent in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."

The deck is designed to efficiently control the game's tempo through card advantage, disruption, and removal spells, allowing the player to dictate the pace of the game and eventually overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats. The inclusion of powerful spells like Dig Through Time and Crux of Fate further solidifies the deck's ability to control the game and come out on top."
