By using counterspells like Dissolve and Silumgar's Scorn, removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Bile Blight, and hand disruption with Thoughtseize, the deck aims to control the board and limit the opponent's options. The dragons, including Dragonlord Ojutai and Dragonlord Silumgar, provide powerful win conditions and flying threats that can quickly close out the game. Dig Through Time and Anticipate help ensure that the deck can find the right answers at the right time."
