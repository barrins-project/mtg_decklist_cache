It includes a mix of efficient creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster, Savage Knuckleblade, and Thunderbreak Regent, all of which have abilities that allow them to deal damage directly or protect themselves. The deck also includes spells like Draconic Roar and Crater's Claws for removal and direct damage. Additionally, it includes counterspells like Stubborn Denial to protect its creatures and disruption. The mana base is designed to support a three-color strategy, allowing for versatility and consistent casting of spells."
