Dromoka's Command and Negate provide disruption and control, while Mastery of the Unseen generates additional threats.

The deck also includes versatile cards like Jeskai Charm and Dig Through Time for added flexibility and card advantage. The inclusion of Dragonlord Ojutai and Shaman of the Great Hunt provides additional threats and card advantage. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the three-color deck and ensure efficient casting of spells."
