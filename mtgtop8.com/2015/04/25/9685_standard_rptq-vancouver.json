The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage through cards like Dig Through Time. One of the key strategies is to maintain card advantage and board control until the late game, where powerful threats like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon can come down to secure the win. The deck also utilizes lands like Haven of the Spirit Dragon and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth to ensure consistent mana production."

Cards like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Foundry Street Denizen are used to quickly build a threatening board presence, while cards like Stoke the Flames and Lightning Strike provide additional reach and removal. Atarka's Command and Hordeling Outburst help generate more tokens to pressure the opponent even more. The deck aims to be proactive and aggressive, aiming to close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
