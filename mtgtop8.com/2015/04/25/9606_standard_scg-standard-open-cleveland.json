The deck utilizes powerful dragons like Silumgar, the Drifting Death and Dragonlord Ojutai as threats, while also running cards like Dig Through Time and Thoughtseize for card advantage and disruption. The mana base is built around providing the necessary colors and fixing, with lands like Polluted Delta and Caves of Koilos. Overall, the deck aims to control the pace of the game until it can establish a dominant position and win."

Card draw and selection from Treasure Cruise, Dig Through Time, and Anticipate keep the deck consistent and able to maintain pressure on the opponent."
