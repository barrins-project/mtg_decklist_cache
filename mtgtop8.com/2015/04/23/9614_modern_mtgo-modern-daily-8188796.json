By using cards like Aether Vial and Lord of Atlantis, the deck aims to boost the power of Merfolk creatures while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Spell Pierce and Spreading Seas. With a focus on tempo and maintaining control of the board, this deck utilizes the synergies between Merfolk creatures to quickly close out games and secure victory."
