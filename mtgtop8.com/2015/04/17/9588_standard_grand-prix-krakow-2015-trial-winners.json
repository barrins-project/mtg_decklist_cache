The use of cards like Whisperwood Elementals and Courser of Kruphix provide card advantage, while See the Unwritten allows for even more powerful creatures to be summoned. With a mix of acceleration and powerful threats, this deck aims to dominate the late game."

The deck also includes defensive cards like Sylvan Caryatid and Nyx-Fleece Ram to buy time until the combo is ready. By efficiently cycling through the deck and generating mana, the deck aims to win the game by either milling the opponent out with Altar of the Brood or overwhelming them with a huge creature."

The deck also includes versatile removal spells like Roast and Dig Through Time to control the board. The combination of aggressive creatures like Savage Knuckleblade and resilient threats like Ashcloud Phoenix make it difficult for opponents to keep up with the constant pressure. Overall, the deck aims to win the game quickly through continuous aggression and powerful threats."
