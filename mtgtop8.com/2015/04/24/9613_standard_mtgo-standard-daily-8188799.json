The inclusion of Dragonlord Ojutai and Silumgar, the Drifting Death provides late-game threats to close out the game. The deck also includes hand disruption with Foul-Tongue Invocation and Hero's Downfall to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck aims to stall the game and outvalue the opponent through efficient removal and card advantage."
