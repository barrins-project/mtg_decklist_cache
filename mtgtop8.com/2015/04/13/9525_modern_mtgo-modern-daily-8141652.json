It utilizes cards like Snapcaster Mage and Vendilion Clique for disruption and card advantage, along with counterspells like Remand and Cryptic Command to protect the combo. Lightning Bolt and Electrolyze provide additional removal and reach. The deck also includes card selection tools like Serum Visions and Anticipate to help find the combo pieces. The key strategy is to control the game until the combo can be assembled and win in a single turn."

By using cards like Spreading Seas to disrupt the opponent's mana base and Aether Vial to cheat creatures onto the battlefield, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The Merfolk lords provide anthem effects to pump up the team, while cards like Cursecatcher and Spell Pierce offer cheap disruption to protect the creatures and push through damage."

With a suite of counterspells like Mana Leak and Cryptic Command, targeted removal like Lightning Bolt and Terminate, and card draw spells like Jace's Ingenuity and Opportunity, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while advancing its own with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Keranos, God of Storms. By controlling the pace of the game and out-valuing opponents, this deck seeks to grind out wins in the late game."
