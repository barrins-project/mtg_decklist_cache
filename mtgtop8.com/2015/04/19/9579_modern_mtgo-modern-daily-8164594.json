The inclusion of cards like Boros Charm, Atarka's Command, and Skullcrack ensure that the damage gets through and can't be prevented or mitigated easily. The mana base is optimized for consistent aggression, allowing for a quick and powerful onslaught."

Using cards like Chandra, Pyromaster and Koth of the Hammer for card advantage and burn damage, the deck can outvalue the opponent in the mid to late game. Blood Moon also serves as a potent disruption tool against multicolor decks, while Relic of Progenitus helps with graveyard hate. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and then finish off the opponent with powerful threats."
