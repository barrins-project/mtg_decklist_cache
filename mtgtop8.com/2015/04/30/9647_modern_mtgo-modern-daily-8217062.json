The deck also focuses on card selection and mana fixing with Ancient Stirrings, Sylvan Scrying, and artifacts like Chromatic Sphere and Chromatic Star. Additionally, it includes disruptive elements like Relic of Progenitus and Ghost Quarter to disrupt opponent's strategies. The deck aims to stabilize the board and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful threats."
