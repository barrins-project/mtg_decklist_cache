Additionally, the inclusion of Blood Moon and Spreading Seas disrupts the opponent's mana base, further enhancing the control aspect of the deck. Overall, the key concept is to outlast the opponent through control and manipulation of the game state."

The key strategy is to assemble the Amulet Titan combo pieces, including Amulet of Vigor, Primeval Titan, and the various bounce lands, to quickly search for and put into play a strong land base. This enables the deck to produce massive amounts of mana, tutor for utility lands, and quickly close out the game with strong Titan attacks."
