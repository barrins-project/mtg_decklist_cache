            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to utilize the heroic mechanic, which rewards you for targeting your own creatures with spells. By playing a combination of cheap spells like Defiant Strike and Ordeal of Thassa, along with protection spells like Gods Willing and Center Soul, you can pump up your creatures like Favored Hoplite and Hero of Iroas to quickly overwhelm your opponent with a high-powered, evasive army. Additionally, cards like Dromoka's Command and Seeker of the Way provide additional utility and flexibility to keep the pressure on your opponent."
