By utilizing cards like Dissolve, Hero's Downfall, and Bile Blight, the player can maintain board control while using Jace's Ingenuity and Dig Through Time to dig for key cards. Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Pearl Lake Ancient provide powerful win conditions, while Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver disrupts the opponent's strategy. The deck aims to outlast the opponent and slowly grind them down while maintaining a strategic advantage throughout the match."

The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Elspeth and Sorin to provide additional threats and support. Thoughtseize is included for disruption, while removal spells like Abzan Charm and Hero's Downfall help deal with opposing threats. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the color requirements of the deck. Overall, the main strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence and efficient threats."
