            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly fill up the graveyard with creatures and then use cards like Sidisi, Brood Tyrant and Risen Executioner to exploit this resource. The deck also utilizes graveyard recursion with Whip of Erebos and Torrent Elemental to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent. Tasigur, the Golden Fang and Thoughtseize provide disruption and control options, while Gurmag Angler offers a big threat that can be cast for cheap using delve. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, aggressive, and resilient with a focus on graveyard interactions."
