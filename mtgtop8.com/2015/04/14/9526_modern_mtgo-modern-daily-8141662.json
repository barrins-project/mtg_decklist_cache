This combo can quickly overwhelm the opponent and secure a win. The deck also includes control elements like counterspells and discard spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect the combo. Tasigur, the Golden Fang provides additional card advantage and pressure. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistency in casting the combo pieces."
