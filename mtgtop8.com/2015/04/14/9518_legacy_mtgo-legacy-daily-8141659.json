The deck utilizes cards like Young Pyromancer, Delver of Secrets, and Monastery Swiftspear to apply pressure while also using efficient counterspells like Force of Will and Daze to protect its threats. Dig Through Time and cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder help to filter through the deck and find the necessary cards to maintain board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
