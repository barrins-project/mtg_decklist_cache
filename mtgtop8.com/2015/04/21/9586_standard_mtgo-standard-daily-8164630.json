            "notes": "The main concept of this Selesnya Aggro deck is to quickly ramp up mana with Elvish Mystic and Warden of the First Tree, while using the synergy between cards like Deathmist Raptor, Den Protector, and Whisperwood Elemental to maintain board presence and pressure opponents. Boon Satyr and Fleecemane Lion provide additional threats, with Surrak, the Hunt Caller offering a powerful hasty finisher. Dromoka's Command and Valorous Stance provide removal and protection for key creatures, ensuring the deck stays aggressive and resilient against opposing strategies."
