The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, while using removal spells like Victim of Night and Disfigure to deal with threats. The deck also includes powerful finishers in the form of Geralf's Messenger, Phyrexian Obliterator, and Tombstalker. The goal is to pressure the opponent early and maintain control of the game until victory."
