Using cards like Heritage Druid and Elvish Archdruid to generate large amounts of mana, along with cards like Ezuri, Renegade Leader to pump up your Elves for a lethal attack. Collected Company and Chord of Calling help you find key pieces of the combo while cards like Spellskite and Reclamation Sage provide disruption and protection. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with a massive Elf army and win the game in a single explosive turn."
