By targeting these creatures with spells like Defiant Strike and Ordeal of Thassa, the deck aims to trigger their heroic abilities and boost them to deal lethal damage to the opponent quickly. The inclusion of cards like Temur Battle Rage and Valorous Stance allows for additional burst damage or removal options to ensure victory in the aggressive strategy."
