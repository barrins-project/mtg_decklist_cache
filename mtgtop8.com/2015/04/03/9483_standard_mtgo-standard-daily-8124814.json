By playing low-cost creatures like Firedrinker Satyr, Foundry Street Denizen, and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to deal quick damage and put pressure on the opponent. Cards like Goblin Rabblemaster, Hordeling Outburst, and Stoke the Flames provide additional damage output, while removal spells like Lightning Strike and Searing Blood help control the board. The deck is focused on dealing damage quickly and efficiently to secure a victory before the opponent can stabilize."
