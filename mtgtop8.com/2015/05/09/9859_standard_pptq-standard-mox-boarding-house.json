By utilizing cards like Thoughtseize and Foul-Tongue Invocation to disrupt the opponent's plans, along with strong removal spells like Crux of Fate and Hero's Downfall, this deck aims to establish control of the game. Additionally, having high-impact finishers like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Dragonlord Silumgar allows the deck to close out games once it has stabilized the board and gained an advantage."
