By playing strong creatures like Thunderbreak Regent and Butcher of the Horde, along with spells like Crackling Doom and Kolaghan's Command, the deck aims to control the battlefield and eliminate threats efficiently. The deck also includes burn spells like Stoke the Flames and Draconic Roar to deal direct damage to opponents. Overall, the key strategy is to establish dominance on the battlefield while keeping the opponent's options limited."
