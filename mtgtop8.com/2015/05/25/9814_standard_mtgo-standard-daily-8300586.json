By playing efficient creatures like Siege Rhino and Fleecemane Lion, along with powerful planeswalkers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion, the deck aims to quickly establish dominance on the battlefield. With a mix of removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Abzan Charm, as well as disruption tools like Thoughtseize, the deck can disrupt the opponent's game plan while steadily building its own board presence to overwhelm the opponent."
