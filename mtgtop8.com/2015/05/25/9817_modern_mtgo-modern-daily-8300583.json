The deck utilizes card draw and graveyard recursion with Ichor Wellspring and Open the Vaults to maintain consistency and resource advantage. Additionally, the deck includes powerful win conditions in Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to close out the game once control has been established."
