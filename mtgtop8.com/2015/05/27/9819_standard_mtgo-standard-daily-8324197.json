The deck aims to control the board with cards like Whisperwood Elemental and Polukranos, World Eater while drawing cards with Shaman of the Great Hunt. The deck also has a toolbox approach with cards like See the Unwritten and Genesis Hydra to search for key creatures. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures while maintaining board control."
