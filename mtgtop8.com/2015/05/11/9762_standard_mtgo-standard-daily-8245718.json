            "notes": "The main concept of this Jeskai Aggro deck is to quickly and aggressively overwhelm your opponent with a combination of powerful creatures like Mantis Rider and Goblin Rabblemaster, backed up with efficient removal spells like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames. The deck is also able to switch roles and control the game with countermagic and card advantage provided by cards like Stratus Dancer and Dig Through Time. The goal is to maintain early pressure and establish dominance on the board while being able to adapt to various situations during the game."
