The deck also includes powerful dragons like Stormbreath Dragon and Thunderbreak Regent to close out the game quickly. Thoughtseize provides disruption against your opponent's game plan, and cards like Soulfire Grand Master and Kolaghan's Command give you additional value and flexibility in combat. Overall, this deck aims to apply early pressure and quickly overwhelm your opponent before they can stabilize."

The deck also utilizes graveyard recursion with Den Protector and Satyr Wayfinder to outvalue the opponent. The inclusion of Elspeth, Sun's Champion adds a strong finisher option to close out games. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a consistent stream of threats while disrupting their game plan."
