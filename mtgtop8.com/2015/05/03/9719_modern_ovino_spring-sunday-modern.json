By playing low-cost creatures like Kird Ape, Wild Nacatl, and Goblin Guide along with pump spells like Mutagenic Growth and Rancor, the deck aims to quickly deal damage and end the game before the opponent can stabilize. Lightning Bolt and Lightning Helix provide additional reach and removal, while cards like Tarmogoyf and Ghor-Clan Rampager offer versatility and power. Atarka's Command can also provide a boost to the team and deal direct damage to the opponent."
