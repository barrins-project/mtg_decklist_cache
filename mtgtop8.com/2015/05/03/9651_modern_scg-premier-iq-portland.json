The deck also includes disruptive elements like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize to control the opponent's hand and Path to Exile to deal with threats. Auriok Champion provides protection against aggro decks while Zealous Persecution can act as a finisher or a board wipe in the right situation. Overall, the strategy revolves around aggressive token generation and efficient removal to secure victory."
