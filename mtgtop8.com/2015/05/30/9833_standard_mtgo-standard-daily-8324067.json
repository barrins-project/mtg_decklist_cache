By using cards like Soulflayer to take advantage of creatures with multiple abilities and using Satyr Wayfinder and Commune with the Gods to fill the graveyard, the deck can bring out strong creatures like Siege Rhino and Sagu Mauler early in the game. By incorporating removal spells like Chained to the Rocks and Thoughtseize, the deck can disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining its aggressive strategy. Abzan Aggro aims to win by outpacing the opponent with big threats and efficient removal."
