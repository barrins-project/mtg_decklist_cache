The deck also includes control elements such as Remand, Cryptic Command, and Spell Snare to protect the combo, along with traditional red burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Electrolyze for additional removal and reach. Snapcaster Mage provides recursion, while Serum Visions helps with card selection. The deck aims to control the game until it can assemble its combo pieces and win the game in a single explosive turn."
