By utilizing cards like Nighthowler and Strength from the Fallen, the deck aims to pump up its creatures with graveyard synergies, while also disrupting the opponent's hand with Brain Maggot and Merciless Executioner. The deck also includes some card draw and graveyard recursion to keep the pressure on the opponent. Overall, the key concept of the deck is to hit hard and fast while maintaining a strong presence on the battlefield."
