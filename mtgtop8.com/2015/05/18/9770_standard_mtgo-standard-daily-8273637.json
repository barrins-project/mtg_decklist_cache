The deck aims to control the board with removal spells such as Hero's Downfall and Abzan Charm, while also disrupting the opponent's strategy with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize. The deck can also generate card advantage and resilience with cards like Den Protector and Wingmate Roc. Finally, the deck can finish the game with powerful threats like Elspeth, Sun's Champion."
