The deck utilizes cycling creatures like Architects of Will and Street Wraith, as well as cascade spells like Demonic Dread and Violent Outburst to trigger Living End. Additionally, the deck includes disruption cards like Fulminator Mage and Beast Within to control the board and prevent opponents from stopping the combo. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a sudden surge of creatures and win the game."

The inclusion of removal spells like Path to Exile and Abrupt Decay helps to maintain board presence and deal with threatening opposing creatures. Lingering Souls provides additional value and resilience, while Tasigur, the Golden Fang offers a powerful late-game threat. The deck aims to apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's strategy to secure a victory."

The deck includes control elements like counterspells and removal to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Snapcaster Mage and Vendilion Clique provide card advantage and disruption, while cards like Lightning Bolt and Grim Lavamancer offer additional removal options. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure the deck can consistently execute its game plan."
