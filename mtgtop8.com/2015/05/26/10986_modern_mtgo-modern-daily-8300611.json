Chalice of the Void and Spell Pierce provide additional disruption to control the pace of the game, while cards like Merrow Reejerey and Master of Waves offer powerful synergies with the Merfolk tribe. Overall, this deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board presence to secure victory."

The mana base is designed to provide flexibility and consistency in casting spells, while also incorporating a win condition with Celestial Colonnade. This deck is built to outlast and outmaneuver opponents, ultimately securing victory through attrition and incremental advantage."
