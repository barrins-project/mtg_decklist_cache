The control aspect comes from cards like Polukranos, World Eater and Arbor Colossus to deal with opposing creatures, while cards like Courser of Kruphix and Whisperwood Elemental provide card advantage and resilience. The deck aims to outvalue opponents by efficiently ramping up mana and playing bigger threats earlier than expected, overwhelming opponents with a combination of powerful creatures and control options."
