By utilizing mana denial with cards like Wasteland and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's progression while steadily building its own forces with creatures like Knight of the Reliquary and Deathrite Shaman. The inclusion of powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Batterskull also helps to further boost the deck's aggression and resilience in combat."
