By deploying powerful creatures like Fleecemane Lion, Avatar of the Resolute, and Reverent Hunter early on, the deck aims to apply pressure and force the opponent to react. With cards like Collected Company and Dromoka's Command to further support its creatures, the deck can quickly establish a dominant board presence. The inclusion of cards like Aspect of Hydra and Valorous Stance also provides additional burst damage and protection, allowing the deck to maintain its aggressive strategy."
