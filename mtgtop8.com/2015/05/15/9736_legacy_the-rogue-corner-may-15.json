            "notes": "This deck focuses on maintaining control of the game through utilizing powerful instant speed spells like Brainstorm, Force of Will, and Swords to Plowshares. It also leans on card advantage and disruption with Dig Through Time, Gitaxian Probe, and Cabal Therapy. Monastery Mentor is a key threat that can quickly take over the game if left unchecked. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's heavy reliance on blue spells, with some black and white for additional removal and disruption. Ultimately, this deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents through careful resource management and efficient spellcasting."
