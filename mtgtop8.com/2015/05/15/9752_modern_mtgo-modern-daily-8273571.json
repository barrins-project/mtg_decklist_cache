The deck also includes Demonic Dread and Violent Outburst to cascade into Living End, providing redundancy for the combo. The deck aims to disrupt your opponent's game plan while setting up your own win condition through cycling and mass creature reanimation."

The deck aims to out-value the opponent by generating card advantage through cards like Snapcaster Mage. The mana base is set up to support a variety of colors for versatility in answering different threats. The strategy is to tempo out the opponent and win the game through incremental advantage and efficient threats."
