The deck also includes counterspells and removal spells to control the game until the combo can be assembled. Additionally, card advantage and selection cards like Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage help to find key combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and to enable the combo to be played consistently."

With the help of cards like Goblin Electromancer and Pyromancer Ascension, players can cast multiple spells in a single turn, leading to a lethal Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens finish. By using rituals and cantrips effectively, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and overwhelm the opponent with an explosive combo turn. The key to success lies in carefully managing resources and timing to maximize the potential of each spell cast."
