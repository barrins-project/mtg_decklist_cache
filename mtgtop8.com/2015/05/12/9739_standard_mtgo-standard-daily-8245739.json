The deck also includes counterspells like Silumgar's Scorn and Dissolve to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of cards like Thoughtseize and Foul-Tongue Invocation helps to control the opponent's hand and board state. Additionally, cards like Dig Through Time and Perilous Vault provide card advantage and board wipe options. The mana base is designed to support the color requirements of the spells in the deck."
