The deck's mana base allows for flexibility in casting spells of different colors, while the efficient card selection provided by Brainstorm and Ponder helps to consistently find key pieces of the deck."

This allows the player to bypass traditional mana costs and overwhelm their opponent with high-impact threats like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Griselbrand. The deck also includes various cantrips and counterspells to help dig for combo pieces and protect its game plan.

The deck uses versatile cards like Abrupt Decay and Thoughtseize to handle a variety of threats, while also leveraging cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana of the Veil for additional value. The deck also includes powerful card advantage engines like Ancestral Vision and Sylvan Library to maintain card advantage and out-resource the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to outpace and outvalue the opponent in a midrange strategy."
