By controlling the board and disrupting opponents with cards like Stasis Snare and Negate, the deck aims to apply pressure and close out games quickly. The addition of Smuggler's Copter provides additional card filtering and evasion, while Thalia, Heretic Cathar disrupts opponents' mana bases. The deck utilizes a mix of creatures, spells, and lands to create a versatile and aggressive strategy."
