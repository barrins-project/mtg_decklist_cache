Stasis Snare and Reflector Mage provide removal and tempo plays, while Always Watching boosts the team's power. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar serves as a finisher. Selfless Spirit protects against board wipes. Revolutionary Rebuff offers some counterspell protection. Declaration in Stone deals with problematic creatures. The deck aims to apply constant pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
