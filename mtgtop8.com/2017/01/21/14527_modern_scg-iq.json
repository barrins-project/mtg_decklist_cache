This is achieved by utilizing a combination of equipment like Paradise Mantle and Cathar's Shield, along with creatures like Sram, Senior Edificer and Puresteel Paladin to draw through the deck and generate mana. The deck includes protection spells like Swan Song and Noxious Revival to help ensure the combo goes off successfully."
