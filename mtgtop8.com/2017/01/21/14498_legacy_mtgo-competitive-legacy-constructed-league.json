It uses cards like Bridge from Below and Nether Shadow to create an army of creatures, while utilizing cards like Dread Return to bring back powerful threats like Prized Amalgam and Ichorid. Cabal Therapy and Gitaxian Probe provide disruption and information about the opponent's hand. The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a combination of graveyard recursion and creature presence."
