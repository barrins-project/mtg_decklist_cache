            "notes": "The core strategy of this Grixis Aggro deck is to quickly control the board and apply pressure on the opponent with efficient threats like Delver of Secrets, Young Pyromancer, and Gurmag Angler. The deck utilizes disruptive cards like Daze, Force of Will, and Stifle to protect its threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. It also runs a suite of cantrips and card draw spells to ensure consistency and card advantage. The land base is optimized for mana efficiency and Wasteland provides additional disruption. Lightning Bolt and Dismember serve as removal spells to handle opposing threats."
