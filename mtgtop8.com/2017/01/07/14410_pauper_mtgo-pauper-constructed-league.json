By using cards like Chittering Rats to disrupt their hand, and Mulldrifter for card draw, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent in the long run. With a mix of removal spells like Chainer's Edict and counterspells like Counterspell, the deck can answer threats efficiently. The inclusion of Archaeomancer allows the deck to recur important spells from the graveyard, adding resilience to the strategy. Lastly, the deck has a solid mana base to ensure consistent casting of spells."
