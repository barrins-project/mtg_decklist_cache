The deck also includes disruptive elements like Deathrite Shaman and Reclamation Sage to help control the game."

By combining powerful reanimation spells with disruption like Force of Will and Daze, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its quick and efficient graveyard-based strategy. With plenty of card draw and manipulation, the deck can find its combo pieces quickly and put the opponent on the back foot before they have a chance to react."
