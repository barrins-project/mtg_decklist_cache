The deck also has a strong finisher in Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and can generate card advantage with Outpost Siege. By controlling the board and maintaining card advantage, this deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents in a grindy game of attrition."

Conflagrate can also be used to finish off your opponent, dealing damage based on the number of cards in your graveyard. The deck aims to take advantage of the graveyard as a resource to create a powerful board presence and close out games quickly."
