By utilizing mana acceleration and card draw, the deck aims to quickly build a wide board presence and pump up its creatures with cards like Timberwatch Elf. This allows for quick and powerful attacks, while also having some lifegain potential with Wellwisher. The overall strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
