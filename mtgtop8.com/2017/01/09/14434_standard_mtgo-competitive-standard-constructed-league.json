With the help of Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Archangel Avacyn, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out the game quickly. The inclusion of cards like Stasis Snare and Selfless Spirit provide additional protection and removal options, while Smuggler's Copter helps with card selection and evasion. Overall, this deck focuses on tempo and efficiency to overwhelm the opponent."

Thalia, Heretic Cathar disrupts opponent's plans while Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides additional threats and token generation. The mana base ensures consistent access to all three colors for a fast, aggressive strategy."
