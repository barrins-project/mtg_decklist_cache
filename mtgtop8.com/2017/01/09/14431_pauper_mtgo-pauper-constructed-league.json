By utilizing cards like Archaeomancer, Chittering Rats, and Mulldrifter to repeatedly target the opponent's key threats, along with counterspells and removal spells, this deck aims to slow down the opponent's game plan and establish a commanding position. The deck also features a mix of card draw spells and mana fixing lands to ensure consistency and resilience in longer games."

By utilizing cards that create multiple creature tokens, along with support creatures that boost their toughness and power, this deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent while also having some control elements to protect its creatures. The inclusion of some evasion creatures helps to ensure that the deck can close out games quickly, while also providing some late-game staying power."
