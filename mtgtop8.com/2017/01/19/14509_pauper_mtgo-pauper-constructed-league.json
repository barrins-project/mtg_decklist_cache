By utilizing cards like Rancor, Vines of Vastwood, and Groundswell, the deck can quickly pump up its creatures and deal damage early in the game. Additionally, the inclusion of Quirion Ranger and Nettle Sentinel helps to ensure a consistent flow of mana and creatures on the board. With a focus on speed and efficiency, this mono green aggro deck aims to quickly take down opponents before they have a chance to stabilize."
