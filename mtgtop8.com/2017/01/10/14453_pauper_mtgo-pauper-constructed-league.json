It aims to control the pace of the game by utilizing efficient removal like Tragic Slip and Chainer's Edict, protecting key pieces with Counterspell and Soul Manipulation, and generating card advantage with Mulldrifter and Forbidden Alchemy. The deck also relies on powerful finishers like Gurmag Angler and Eldrazi Skyspawner to close out the game once control has been established."
