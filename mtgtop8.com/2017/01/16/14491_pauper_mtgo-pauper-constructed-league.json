            "notes": "The main concept of this Aggro-Affinity deck is to flood the board with cheap artifacts such as Atog, Carapace Forger, Frogmite, and Myr Enforcer using cards like Thoughtcast and Perilous Research. These artifacts enable powerful synergies like sacrificing artifacts for Atog's ability or boosting creatures with Temur Battle Rage. The deck also includes removal and card draw spells like Galvanic Blast and Prophetic Prism to maintain tempo. The mana base consists of artifact lands and mana fixing spells to ensure smooth mana production for casting the cards in the deck."
