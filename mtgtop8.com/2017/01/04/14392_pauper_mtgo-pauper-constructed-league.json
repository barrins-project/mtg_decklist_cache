            "notes": "The main concept of this Boros Aggro deck is to maintain a fast and aggressive pace by utilizing low-cost creatures and spells to deal quick damage to the opponent. By utilizing efficient cards like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt for direct damage, alongside creature spells like Thraben Inspector and Glint Hawk for board presence, the deck is focused on pressuring the opponent early in the game. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Kuldotha Rebirth and Battle Screech allows for generating additional value and tokens to overwhelm the opponent. With a mix of burn spells and creature aggression, this deck aims to win the game quickly."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly dealing damage to the opponent using burn spells and aggressive creatures. It aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and efficient spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Fireblast, while also maintaining consistent damage with cards like Curse of the Pierced Heart. The strategy involves applying pressure early on and finishing off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The key is to maximize damage output each turn and efficiently use resources to close out the game quickly."
