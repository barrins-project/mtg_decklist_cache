With cards like Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top, the deck aims to counter or manipulate the top card of the opponent's library while efficiently answering threats with cards like Swords to Plowshares and Terminus. The deck also has win conditions in the form of Monastery Mentor and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, allowing the player to close out the game once they have established control."

By utilizing disruptive spells like Chalice of the Void and Thorn of Amethyst, the deck aims to slow down opponents while maintaining a strong board presence. The inclusion of utility lands like Eye of Ugin and Karakas further enhances the deck's ability to disrupt opponents and close out games quickly with its aggressive creatures."
