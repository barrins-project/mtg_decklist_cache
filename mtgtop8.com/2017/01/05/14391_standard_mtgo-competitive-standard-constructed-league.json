By using pump spells like Larger Than Life and Uncaged Fury, the deck aims to deal massive amounts of damage quickly and overwhelm opponents with aggressive plays. The inclusion of Blossoming Defense helps protect key creatures from removal, allowing for a more consistent and powerful assault. With a mix of efficient creatures and pump spells, this deck aims to close out games fast."
