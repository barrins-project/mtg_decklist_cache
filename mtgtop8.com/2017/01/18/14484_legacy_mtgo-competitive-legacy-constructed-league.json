The deck includes card draw and manipulation with Ponder, Brainstorm, and Sensei's Divining Top to find answers and set up powerful plays. Removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Terminus help deal with threats, while win conditions like Entreat the Angels provide a way to close out the game. The deck aims to out-value and outlast the opponent through careful resource management and efficient plays."
