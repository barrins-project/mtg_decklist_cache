The deck also includes control elements such as counterspells and removal spells to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan.

The main win condition is utilizing Dynavolt Tower to deal damage to the opponent while also generating energy to counter their threats. The deck also includes card draw and versatile removal options to maintain control of the game. Torrential Gearhulk provides additional value by casting a powerful instant spell from the graveyard. Overall, the strategy revolves around managing resources efficiently and outlasting the opponent until the win condition is achieved."
