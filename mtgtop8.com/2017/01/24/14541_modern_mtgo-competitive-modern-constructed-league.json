With a focus on aggressive plays and strong synergy between cards, the Affinity archetype aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient strategy that can be difficult to deal with when piloted correctly. The inclusion of cards like Vault Skirge and Arcbound Ravager further enhance the deck's ability to press the advantage and secure a swift victory."

The deck is also focused on maximizing creature synergy, with cards like Drogskol Captain and Selfless Spirit providing additional advantages to the team. With the help of Collected Company, the deck can quickly fill the board with threats and put pressure on the opponent to keep up."

The deck is designed to take advantage of the Dredge mechanic and exploit the graveyard as a resource to create a fast and consistent combo strategy."
