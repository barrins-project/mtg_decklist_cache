By leveraging the synergy between efficient creatures like Bloodhall Priest and Scrapheap Scrounger, alongside powerful burn spells like Fiery Temper and Unlicensed Disintegration, the deck aims to apply early pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of Key to the City helps to provide card advantage and ensures that the deck can maintain momentum throughout the game."
