The deck aims to stall the opponent with cards like Consulate Skygate and Filigree Familiar, while milling them out with Manic Scribe and Startled Awake. The deck also includes card draw spells like Glimmer of Genius and Take Inventory to help find key pieces. Engulf the Shore serves as a board wipe, while Epiphany at the Drownyard provides additional mill and card advantage. Pilgrim's Eye helps fix mana and ensure consistency in the deck."
