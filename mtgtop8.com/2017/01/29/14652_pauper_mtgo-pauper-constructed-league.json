The main goal is to create tempo advantage by bouncing opponent's creatures with cards like Vapor Snag and Snap, while simultaneously applying pressure with evasive threats like Ninja of the Deep Hours and Delver of Secrets. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain card advantage through efficient draw spells like Preordain and Ponder. The overall strategy revolves around maintaining a balance between aggression and control to secure victory."

It aims to stall the game and slowly build up card advantage by recurring spells and constantly drawing cards. The combination of creatures with enter the battlefield effects and flicker spells provide additional value and board presence. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to both blue and black mana sources. Overall, the deck focuses on outlasting the opponent and winning through attrition."
