The deck utilizes card draw, mana ramp, and protection spells to set up the combo as quickly and efficiently as possible. It aims to either draw the entire deck with Ad Nauseam and win with Laboratory Maniac or deal lethal damage with Lightning Storm. The deck also includes alternate win conditions and lands that help with mana fixing and ramp."

Lingering Souls provides recurring threats and evasion, while cards like Collective Brutality, Maelstrom Pulse, and Abrupt Decay offer flexible answers to a variety of threats. The deck aims to maintain pressure while disrupting the opponent's game plan."

Primeval Titan is also used to search for more lands and accelerate the combo. The deck aims to assemble the combo pieces as quickly as possible to overwhelm the opponent with damage from Valakut triggers, ultimately winning the game in a powerful burst."
