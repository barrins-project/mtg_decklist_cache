The deck also includes interaction with Anger of the Gods and Lightning Helix for additional removal and life gain. With a strong mana base and card selection, the deck looks to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents in a slower-paced game."

By using cards like Viscera Seer, Melira, and Anafenza, players can quickly assemble game-winning combinations while also having access to utility creatures like Qasali Pridemage and Spellskite. Chord of Calling and Collected Company are essential for tutoring and bringing out the necessary pieces for the combo. The mana base is designed to support the various colors needed for the creatures' abilities and to allow for flexibility in casting spells."

With cards like Cryptic Command, Path to Exile, and Ancestral Vision, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and eventually win the game with efficient threats like Restoration Angel and Celestial Colonnade. Ultimately, the deck's goal is to control the game until it can secure a win condition."

The main win condition revolves around casting Scapeshift to search for and put into play multiple copies of Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle, along with Mountains to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent in one turn. Bring to Light acts as a versatile tutor, allowing the player to search for any key spell needed in a given situation."
