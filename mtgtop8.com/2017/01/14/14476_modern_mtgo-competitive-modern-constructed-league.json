By using cards like Azusa, Lost but Seeking and Sakura-Tribe Scout to ramp up mana and bounce lands with cards like Simic Growth Chamber, the deck is able to cast Primeval Titan early and search for utility lands like Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion or Slayers' Stronghold. This allows for powerful attacks with the Titan and enables combo wins with the right sequence of plays."
