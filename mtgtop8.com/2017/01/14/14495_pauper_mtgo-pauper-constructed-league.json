By maintaining a constant stream of damage and pressuring the opponent's life total, it aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize or mount a comeback. The aggressive strategy is supported by a low mana curve and a mix of burn spells and creatures that can both deal damage and provide additional utility. The key is to maintain a relentless assault and finish off the opponent before they can stabilize."
