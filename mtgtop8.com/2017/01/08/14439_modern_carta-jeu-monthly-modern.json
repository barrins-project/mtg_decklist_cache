            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with aggressive creatures and combat tricks, maximizing damage output while maintaining board presence. The key strategy involves playing efficient creatures like Experiment One and Avatar of the Resolute, buffing them with spells like Rancor and Aspect of Hydra, and protecting them with cards like Vines of Vastwood. The mono green color ensures consistency and simplicity in casting spells, allowing for a streamlined game plan of attacking and applying pressure from the early game onwards."

By utilizing Thought Scour and Gitaxian Probe to fill the graveyard and dig for more threats, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and finish the game quickly. The red removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Tarfire help to clear the way for its creatures, while Stubborn Denial offers additional protection for its key threats. The tempo advantage gained through efficient spells like Vapor Snag and Serum Visions can quickly overwhelm opponents."
