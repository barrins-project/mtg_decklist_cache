By utilizing cards like Life from the Loam and Knight of the Reliquary, the deck aims to generate value and grind out the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Abrupt Decay, Liliana of the Veil, and Chalice of the Void provides the necessary disruption to shut down the opponent's game plan. The deck can also generate card advantage and gain incremental advantage through cards like Dark Confidant and Sylvan Library, allowing it to stay ahead in the long game."
