It also utilizes powerful creatures like True-Name Nemesis, Leovold, Emissary of Trest, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to put pressure on the opponent and generate card advantage. The lands in the deck are optimized for mana fixing and disruption through cards like Wasteland."

The goal is to cheat in powerful creatures like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Griselbrand onto the battlefield early in the game, overwhelming the opponent with their presence. Force of Will and Spell Pierce provide protection for the combo pieces, while Jace, the Mind Sculptor can help control the opponent's board and provide card advantage."
