The deck also utilizes powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf and Deathrite Shaman to pressure the opponent and close out the game quickly. Baleful Strix provides card advantage and Snapcaster Mage allows for flexibility in reusing spells from the graveyard. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the multi-color requirements of the deck."
