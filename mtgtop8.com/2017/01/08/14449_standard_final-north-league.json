The deck also includes removal spells like Ruinous Path and Unlicensed Disintegration, as well as board wipes like Radiant Flames. The win condition comes from using Torrential Gearhulk to flash back powerful spells and flipping Thing in the Ice to clear the board. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the three-color archetype."
