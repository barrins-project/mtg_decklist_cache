Cards like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident pump up the Merfolk creatures, while Aether Vial allows for quick creature deployment. Spreading Seas can disrupt the opponent's manabase, and cards like Harbinger of the Tides can bounce problematic creatures back to the opponent's hand. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive Merfolk tribal strategy."

The deck also includes disruptive cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The planeswalkers Liliana of the Veil and Liliana, the Last Hope provide additional value and control elements. Overall, the deck seeks to maintain a strong board presence while disrupting the opponent's strategy, ultimately aiming to close out the game quickly with its aggressive creatures and burn spells."
