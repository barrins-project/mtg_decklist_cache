It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while gradually building up its own resources. The combination of Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top provides a strong control over the top card of the library. Monastery Mentor and Snapcaster Mage offer additional threats and value. The deck's strength lies in its ability to outlast opponents with patient and strategic gameplay, eventually overwhelming them with superior card advantage and powerful planeswalkers."

Cabal Therapy and Careful Study help to quickly cycle through the deck, while Bridge from Below provides additional value when creatures are put into the graveyard. The deck also includes mana acceleration with cards like Lion's Eye Diamond and Lotus Petal to quickly set up explosive plays."
