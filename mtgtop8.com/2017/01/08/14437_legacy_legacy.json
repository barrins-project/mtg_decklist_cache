The deck also includes disruption in the form of counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce, as well as disruption through discard spells like Thoughtseize. Crucible of Worlds and Wasteland are included to disrupt opponents' mana bases. The deck aims to control the game until it can assemble the combo and win."

This deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and explosive strategy that can lead to powerful combos like Dread Return with Griselbrand or Flame-Kin Zealot. Additionally, cards like Cabal Therapy and Faithless Looting allow for disruption and card selection to enable the combo."
