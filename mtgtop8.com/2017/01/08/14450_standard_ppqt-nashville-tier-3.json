By utilizing pump spells like Larger Than Life and Rush of Adrenaline, as well as combat tricks like Uncaged Fury and Blossoming Defense, you can easily push for lethal damage. Additionally, the deck includes mana fixing cards like Servant of the Conduit and Attune with Aether to ensure you hit your color requirements and can consistently cast your threats."
