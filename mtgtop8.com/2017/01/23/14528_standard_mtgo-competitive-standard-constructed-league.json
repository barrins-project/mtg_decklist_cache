Selfless Spirit provides protection for your creatures, while cards like Anguished Unmaking and Grasp of Darkness offer removal options. Thraben Inspector helps with card advantage and Ayli can serve as both a threat and a way to gain life. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy, with a mix of fast lands and creature lands to ensure a smooth curve of threats."
