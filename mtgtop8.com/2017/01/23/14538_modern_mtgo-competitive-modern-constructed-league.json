The deck utilizes card advantage through cards like Ancestral Vision and Tasigur, the Golden Fang to outvalue the opponent in the long game. Combined with versatile spells like Cryptic Command and Kolaghan's Command, this deck aims to control the game's tempo and eventually close out the game with powerful finishers like Gurmag Angler."
