            "notes": "The main concept of this Merfolk deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of efficiently costed creatures that benefit from the tribal synergies provided by Lords of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident. The deck aims to establish board dominance early with cards like Cursecatcher and Harbinger of the Tides, while disrupting the opponent's game plan with Spreading Seas and Vapor Snag. Aether Vial serves as a versatile tool for maintaining tempo and generating card advantage. Minamo, School at Water's Edge and Oboro, Palace in the Clouds provide additional utility and flexibility in the mana base."
