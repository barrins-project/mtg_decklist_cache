The deck features powerful creatures like Archangel Avacyn, Thalia, Heretic Cathar, Spell Queller, and Glory-Bound Initiate to deal damage quickly. It also includes defensive options like Selfless Spirit and Thraben Inspector. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides additional support and can help close out the game."
