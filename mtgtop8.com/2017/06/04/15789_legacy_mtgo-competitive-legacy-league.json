Glimpse of Nature helps draw into more creatures to keep the engine going, while cards like Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger provide additional utility and flexibility. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a sudden burst of powerful creatures and finish the game quickly."

The key strategy is to utilize cheap, efficient spells like Lightning Bolt and Daze to control the board and protect your threats like Delver of Secrets and Young Pyromancer. By utilizing cards like Brainstorm and Ponder to manipulate your draws and cards like Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's hand, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly before they can establish their own game plan."
