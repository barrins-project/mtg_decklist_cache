Add in powerful spells like Dark Salvation, Fatal Push, and Grasp of Darkness to control the board and keep your opponent on the back foot. The goal is to apply constant pressure and close out the game before your opponent can stabilize."

The deck includes energy-generating cards like Woodweaver's Puzzleknot and Servant of the Conduit, as well as card draw spells like Glimmer of Genius to find key pieces. With access to powerful creatures and potential for explosive plays, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly before they can respond. Additionally, cards like Whirler Virtuoso and Tireless Tracker provide value and versatility in different situations."
