It aims to attack aggressively with flying threats such as Heart of Kiran and finish off opponents with burn spells like Unlicensed Disintegration. The mana base allows for consistent and fast plays, while the inclusion of removal spells like Fatal Push and versatile threats like Archangel Avacyn provides flexibility in dealing with opposing strategies. Overall, the deck prioritizes early pressure and constant board presence to overwhelm the opponent."
