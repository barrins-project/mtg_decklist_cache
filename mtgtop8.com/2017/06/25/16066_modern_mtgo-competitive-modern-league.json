The key strategy is to assemble UrzaTron (Urza's Mine, Power Plant, and Tower) to generate a large amount of mana quickly, allowing you to cast expensive spells ahead of schedule. The deck also includes versatile cards like Snapcaster Mage and Expedition Map to provide flexibility in various situations, ultimately aiming to outvalue and outlast the opponent through efficient resource management and powerful threats."
