By using cards like Street Wraith and Thoughtseize to lower your own life total, combined with efficient removal spells and card draw, you can quickly overwhelm your opponent with a huge Death's Shadow. Tasigur and Gurmag Angler provide additional threats, while Snapcaster Mage allows you to effectively reuse key spells. The deck's goal is to apply high pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan, ultimately claiming victory through aggressive tactics."

The deck also includes disruption elements like Harbinger of the Tides and Dismember to control the opponent's board. Aether Vial and Cavern of Souls help with mana efficiency and spell resilience. The ultimate goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of Merfolk creatures and secure a quick victory."
