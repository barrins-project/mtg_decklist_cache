Additionally, the deck seeks to gain a card advantage with cards like Leovold, Emissary of Trest, and Stoneforge Mystic to tutor equipments like Umezawa's Jitte and Sword of Fire and Ice to enhance the abilities of creatures like True-Name Nemesis and make them harder to deal with. Deathrite Shaman and Noble Hierarch provide mana acceleration to help cast spells faster."

The deck aims to outvalue the opponent with cards like Liliana of the Veil and generate card advantage through Dark Confidant. Key to the aggressive strategy is the ability to disrupt opponent's game plan with cards like Hymn to Tourach and Geth's Verdict while also leveraging the power of equipment like Sword of Light and Shadow and Sword of Fire and Ice to close out games quickly."
