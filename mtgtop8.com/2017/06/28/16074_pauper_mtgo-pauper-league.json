It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by destroying their creatures and countering their spells, while also generating card advantage through recursion with Archaeomancer and Chittering Rats. The deck also has some late-game threats like Gurmag Angler to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. It is a resilient and versatile control deck that can adapt to various matchups and board states."
