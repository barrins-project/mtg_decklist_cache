Primeval Titan can also help search for Valakut and accelerate the combo. Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides additional value and removal, while Relic of Progenitus helps disrupt graveyard strategies. The deck aims to control the board until it can assemble the combo and win the game in one explosive turn."
