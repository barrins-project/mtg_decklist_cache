By controlling the flow of the game and out-valuing your opponent with card advantage, you aim to stabilize the board and eventually win through efficient card draw and powerful finishers like Mulldrifter and Chittering Rats. The deck excels at controlling the tempo of the game and grinding out victories through attrition and careful decision-making."
