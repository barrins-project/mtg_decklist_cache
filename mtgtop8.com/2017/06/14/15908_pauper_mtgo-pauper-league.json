This mana is used to cast powerful spells like Mulldrifter and Dinrova Horror, while also utilizing control elements like Prohibit and Condescend to disrupt the opponent's plans. The inclusion of cards like Pulse of Murasa and Moment's Peace provide additional survivability, while cards like Mystical Teachings and Forbidden Alchemy help find key spells when needed. Ultimately, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through efficient use of resources."

The deck also utilizes cards that can draw more cards or create tokens to keep up the pressure. By utilizing the mana-fixing of Prophetic Prism and the artifact lands, this deck can consistently cast its spells while maintaining a strong board presence. It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and burn spells, ultimately securing victory through quick and decisive attacks."
