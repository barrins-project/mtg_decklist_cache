It aims to outvalue the opponent with creatures like Mulldrifter and Archaeomancer, while constantly disrupting their game plan with counterspells and removal spells like Chainer's Edict and Doom Blade. By constantly drawing cards and denying the opponent's threats, the deck aims to grind out the opponent and secure victory through attrition. Additionally, using cards like Ghostly Flicker for synergy and recursion with Archaeomancer adds another layer of control and value to the deck."
