The deck aims to play aggressively and efficiently, utilizing cheap removal spells like Fatal Push and Terminate to control the board. The deck also uses cards like Mishra's Bauble and Traverse the Ulvenwald to dig for key pieces and maximize its resources. Overall, the deck relies on a balance of aggression, disruption, and resource management to overwhelm opponents in the Modern format."
