Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek helps disrupt the opponent's strategy, while cards like Snapcaster Mage and Kolaghan's Command provide additional value and flexibility."

It also utilizes cards like Gifts Ungiven to tutor for key combo pieces and Past in Flames to recycle spells from the graveyard. The deck focuses on fast and explosive combo plays to overwhelm the opponent before they can react."
