This is supported by efficient removal spells like Fatal Push, Terminate, and Kolaghan's Command, as well as disruption from cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek. The deck also includes card draw and selection with Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage to maintain card advantage. The inclusion of Street Wraith allows for easy life loss to lower the cost of Death's Shadow, making it a highly synergistic and powerful aggro deck."

The deck utilizes cards like Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer to reduce the cost of spells, along with card draw and selection spells like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to help find the combo pieces quickly. By efficiently chaining spells together, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win the game in a single explosive turn."
