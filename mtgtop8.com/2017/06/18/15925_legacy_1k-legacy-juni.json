The mana denial strategy with Wasteland and disruption with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Leovold, Emissary of Trest help the deck maintain control of the game and out-value the opponent in the long run. The combination of disruption, threats, and card advantage make it a strong contender in the Legacy format."
