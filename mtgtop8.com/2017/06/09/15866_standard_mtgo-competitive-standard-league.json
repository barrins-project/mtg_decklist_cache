Whirler Virtuoso and Rogue Refiner provide additional energy and board presence, while cards like Censor and Negate offer disruption and protection. The deck aims to ramp up quickly, control the board with removal spells like Harnessed Lightning, and overwhelm the opponent with big threats like Ulamog."
