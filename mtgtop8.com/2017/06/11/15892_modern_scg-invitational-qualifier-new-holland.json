The key is to use cards like Arcbound Ravager and Steel Overseer to buff the team, while also being able to protect key creatures with Etched Champion and Welding Jar. The mana base consists of mostly artifact lands and mana producers like Mox Opal to ensure a fast and consistent mana base. The inclusion of burn spells like Galvanic Blast helps to finish off opponents quickly if needed."

Bitterblossom provides a steady stream of Faerie tokens, while cards like Mistbind Clique and Snapcaster Mage offer additional value and tempo plays. The deck ultimately wins by grinding out the opponent and overwhelming them with Faerie creatures."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage through Snapcaster Mage and Sphinx's Revelation. By efficiently answering threats and maintaining a resilient board state, the deck seeks to outvalue the opponent and secure victory through incremental advantage. Additionally, the combination of burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lightning Helix provides reach and helps control the board early in the game."
