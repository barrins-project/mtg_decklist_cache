Tezzeret Planeswalkers serve as both win conditions and utility cards, supporting the artifact theme of the deck. Trinket Mage helps tutor for key artifacts, while cards like Mishra's Bauble and Relic of Progenitus provide card advantage and disruption. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through controlling the game state."

Using cheap removal spells and disruption, the deck aims to control the game in the early turns while deploying threats that can end the game quickly. Snapcaster Mage provides additional value by allowing you to reuse key spells, while Thought Scour and Serum Visions help to filter through your deck and find the cards you need to close out the game efficiently."
