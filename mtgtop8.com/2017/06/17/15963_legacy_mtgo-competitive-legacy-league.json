By utilizing cards like Wasteland, Rishadan Port, and Maze of Ith, the player can disrupt the opponent's mana base and prevent their creatures from attacking. The key combo in this deck involves Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage to create a powerful 20/20 indestructible creature. Life from the Loam helps to consistently recycle lands and Punishing Fire can be used as removal or a win condition. The deck aims to control the board and win through a strong land-based strategy."
