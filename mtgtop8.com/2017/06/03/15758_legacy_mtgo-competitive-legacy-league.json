The deck also features card advantage engines like Life from the Loam and Tireless Tracker to maintain resources and outvalue the opponent. Overall, the key strategy is to grind out the opponent with efficient control and powerful land interactions."

The win condition typically involves generating value with cards like Monastery Mentor and Snapcaster Mage, and potentially locking down the board with cards like Terminus and Supreme Verdict. The mana base includes lands that can provide both blue and white mana sources, allowing for flexibility in casting spells in this UWx Control archetype."
