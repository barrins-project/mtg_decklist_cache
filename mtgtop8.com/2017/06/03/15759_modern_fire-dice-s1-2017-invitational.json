The deck includes a mix of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw spells to control the board and outvalue the opponent. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Torrential Gearhulk and Celestial Colonnade to close out the game once the opponent's threats are neutralized. The mana base is designed to support the Esper colors and ensure consistency in casting spells."

It also utilizes land destruction and mana denial through cards like Tectonic Edge and Spreading Seas to further control the pace of the game. The win condition is through efficient removal and evasive threats like Celestial Colonnade to slowly chip away at the opponent's life total while maintaining control of the board. Overall, the deck aims to outlast and outvalue the opponent by controlling the game until it can secure a victory."
