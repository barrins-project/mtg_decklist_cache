By utilizing cheap removal spells and counterspells to protect its threats, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of pressure while also maintaining card advantage through card draw spells. The inclusion of Ninjas of the Deep Hours allows for additional card advantage and tempo swings, giving the deck multiple avenues to outmaneuver the opponent and secure victory."

The control aspect comes from cards like Remove Soul, Prohibit, Condescend, and Mnemonic Wall to counter and disrupt opponent's strategies. The deck also utilizes card draw and recursion with Mulldrifter, Mystical Teachings, and Forbidden Alchemy. The win conditions include big threats like Ulamog's Crusher and Dinrova Horror, as well as repeated use of Moment's Peace to stall the game until the deck can overpower the opponent with its mana advantage."
