It includes cards that help dig through the deck for key pieces, like Mulldrifter and Mystical Teachings, while also providing options for removal and protection. The goal is to use the mana advantage from the Urzatron lands to cast powerful spells like Dinrova Horror and control the game until the win condition can be successfully executed. This control archetype aims to outlast opponents by carefully using resources and making efficient decisions."
