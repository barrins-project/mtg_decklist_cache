            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to maintain board presence through a combination of low-cost creatures and efficient counterspells, while utilizing card draw and manipulation to ensure consistency. The focus is on tempo and controlling the game state, with the potential to pivot into a more aggressive strategy with Lightning Bolt and Skred. The inclusion of Ninja of the Deep Hours allows for card advantage and potential tempo swings, while Faerie Miscreant and Spellstutter Sprite help disrupt opponents' strategies. The deck aims to apply pressure while maintaining control."
