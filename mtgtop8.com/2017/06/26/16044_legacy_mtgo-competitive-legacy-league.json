This is achieved by using cards like Exploration, Gamble, Life from the Loam, and Punishing Fire to slow down the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck aims to create a powerful token creature using the Dark Depths combo with Thespian's Stage. The deck also utilizes other utility lands like Glacial Chasm, Maze of Ith, and Wasteland to further disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain control of the game."
