Mulldrifter and Sea Gate Oracle provide card advantage and board presence, while Fangren Marauder can gain life and stabilize against aggressive strategies. Overall, the deck aims to establish a dominant position and overpower the opponent with late-game threats."

Atog and Fling are included as finishers to close out games when the opponent least expects it.
