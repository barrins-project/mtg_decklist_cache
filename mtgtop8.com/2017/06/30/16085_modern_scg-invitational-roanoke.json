            "notes": "The main goal of this deck is to control the game by denying the opponent access to key cards while protecting yourself with Ensnaring Bridge. Lantern of Insight and Codex Shredder are used to manipulate the opponent's draws, while also digging for essential pieces like Crucible of Worlds and Ghirapur Aether Grid. The deck also has disruption tools like Pithing Needle, Thoughtseize, and Surgical Extraction to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of Leyline of Sanctity provides protection against targeted discard and burn spells, making it difficult for the opponent to interact with your game plan."
