The inclusion of cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek helps to disrupt the opponent's hand as well.

By playing a combination of powerful control spells like Cryptic Command, Supreme Verdict, and Snapcaster Mage, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and eventually win the game through card advantage and efficient removal. The deck also utilizes powerful finishers like Celestial Colonnade and Dragonlord Ojutai to close out the game once the opponent has been locked out of the game."
