The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze, while also digging for more threats and answers with cards like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Gitaxian Probe. The mana base is streamlined and efficient to ensure consistent access to the deck's powerful spells."
