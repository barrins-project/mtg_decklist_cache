By utilizing cards like Springleaf Drum, Prophetic Prism, and Ichor Wellspring to generate mana and draw cards, the deck can quickly flood the board with threats like Myr Enforcer, Frogmite, and Carapace Forger. Galvanic Blast and Fling provide additional reach to finish off opponents or remove key blockers. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board presence with a mix of efficient creatures and burn spells."
