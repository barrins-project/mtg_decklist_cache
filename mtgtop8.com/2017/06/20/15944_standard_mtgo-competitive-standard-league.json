Foundry Inspector and Glint-Nest Crane help to reduce the cost of artifacts, while cards like Cultivator's Caravan and Hedron Archive provide mana acceleration. The deck also includes card draw and filtering with Prophetic Prism and Metalspinner's Puzzleknot. Key to the City allows for creature evasion and card filtering, while Skysovereign, Consul Flagship provides removal and a big threat."
