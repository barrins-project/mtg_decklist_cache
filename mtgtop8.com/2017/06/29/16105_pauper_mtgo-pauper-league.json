It combines the synergies of cards like Springleaf Drum, Ichor Wellspring, and Flayer Husk to create a fast and relentless playstyle, while also including removal options like Galvanic Blast and Temur Battle Rage to maintain control of the board and finish off opponents quickly."

By utilizing cheap artifacts and mana ramp, the deck aims to flood the board with threats and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The deck also includes card draw and mana fixing to ensure consistency in its aggressive strategy. With a mix of card draw, creature buffs, and direct damage, the deck aims to outpace and outvalue the opponent in order to secure a quick victory."
