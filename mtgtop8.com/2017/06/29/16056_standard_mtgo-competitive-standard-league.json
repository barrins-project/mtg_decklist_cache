By using cards like Oketra's Monument to generate tokens and cards like Dusk / Dawn to recover from board wipes, the goal is to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. This deck relies on synergy between its creatures and enchantments to create a cohesive strategy that can be difficult for opponents to deal with."

By generating early board presence and maintaining pressure with aggressive creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents before they can establish their own game plan. The inclusion of removal spells like Harnessed Lightning and Magma Spray help maintain board control while providing additional reach to close out games. The deck's versatility allows it to adapt to various matchups and maintain a proactive game plan throughout the match."
