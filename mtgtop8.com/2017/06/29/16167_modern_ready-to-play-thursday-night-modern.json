It also includes disruption in the form of Inquisition of Kozilek and Stubborn Denial to control the opponent's game plan, while also utilizing efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Terminate to deal with threats. The deck aims to apply pressure early and close out the game quickly."

Once at seven lands, the goal is to cast Scapeshift to search for Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and enough Mountains to deal lethal damage to the opponent. This combo relies on Primeval Titan to search for Valakut and trigger its ability multiple times, while also controlling the board with removal spells like Lightning Bolt. Courser of Kruphix provides card advantage and helps with land drops, making the deck consistent in executing its win condition."
