This aggressive strategy is supported by strong mana base with a mix of dual lands and artifact lands to ensure consistent colors. The inclusion of vehicles such as Heart of Kiran and Aethersphere Harvester allow for additional damage and evasion, while cards like Scrapheap Scrounger provide resilience against removal. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly while maintaining board control."
