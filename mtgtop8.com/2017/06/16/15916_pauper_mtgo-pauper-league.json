It includes a variety of card draw, counterspells, and removal spells to stall the opponent and maintain control of the board. The deck also includes recursion and bounce effects to provide additional value and resilience. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and overwhelm them with big threats and efficient control spells."
