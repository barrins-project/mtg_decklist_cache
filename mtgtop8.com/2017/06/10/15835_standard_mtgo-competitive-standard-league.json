The deck also focuses on using Traverse the Ulvenwald to search for the necessary pieces and ramping up with creatures like Tireless Tracker and Nissa, Voice of Zendikar. The inclusion of cards like Never/Return and Fatal Push ensures that the deck maintains board control while also putting pressure on the opponent. Finally, Verdurous Gearhulk and Walking Ballista are used as finishing threats to seal the game."
