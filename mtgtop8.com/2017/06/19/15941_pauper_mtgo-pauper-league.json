By disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Chainer's Edict, Capsize, and Terminate, while also keeping a steady stream of resources with Forbidden Alchemy, Brainstorm, and Pristine Talisman, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent. The mana base is built around fixing colors and providing flexibility, allowing for a variety of spells to be cast efficiently. The ultimate goal is to grind out the opponent until victory is achieved."
