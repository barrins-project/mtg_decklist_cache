Key cards like Life from the Loam and Dredge creatures allow the player to constantly recur threats like Prized Amalgam and Bloodghast from the graveyard, overwhelming the opponent with a continuous stream of creatures. The deck aims to use Conflagrate as a finisher that can deal massive damage to the opponent while also clearing the board of threats. Overall, the deck's strength lies in its ability to quickly fill the graveyard and generate a powerful board state."

The deck also includes removal spells like Terminate, Fatal Push, and Lightning Bolt to deal with threats. Additionally, it utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Chandra, Torch of Defiance to control the board and generate advantage. The deck aims to maintain a proactive stance while disrupting the opponent's strategy and outvaluing them in the long run."
