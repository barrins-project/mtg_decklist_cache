The inclusion of cards like Searing Blaze and Skullcrack also helps to control the opponent's board and prevent them from gaining life or stabilizing, ultimately leading to a swift victory."

By using cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Leonin Arbiter to slow down the opponent's plays, and Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play, the deck aims to control the board and win through combat damage. The inclusion of cards like Flickerwisp and Restoration Angel provide additional utility and protection for key creatures like Mirran Crusader. The deck is designed to be aggressive and disruptive, putting the opponent on the back foot while gradually wearing them down."
