Cards like Galvanic Blast and Fling provide reach and removal, while Myr Enforcer, Frogmite, and Carapace Forger act as efficient beaters. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle, utilizing the affinity mechanic to deploy threats ahead of curve and close out games before the opponent can stabilize."

The inclusion of Ninjas of the Deep Hours provides additional card draw and potential for tempo swings, allowing the deck to maintain pressure and advantage throughout the game. This strategy aims to outmaneuver and outpace the opponent in order to secure victory."
