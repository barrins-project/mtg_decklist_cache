The deck includes energy-generating cards like Woodweaver's Puzzleknot and Rogue Refiner to help activate Marvel faster. It also includes ways to protect Marvel with counterspells like Negate and Censor. Chandra, Flamecaller provides additional board presence and card advantage. The deck aims to quickly ramp into casting Ulamog or other threats ahead of schedule to overwhelm the opponent and win the game."
