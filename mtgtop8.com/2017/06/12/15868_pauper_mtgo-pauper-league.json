The deck includes various card draw options such as Mulldrifter and Prophetic Prism, as well as counterspells like Prohibit and Condescend. It also includes tools for recursion and utility with cards like Pulse of Murasa and Mystical Teachings. The goal is to stall the game with removal and counterspells until the deck can generate enough mana to cast powerful threats like Dinrova Horror and overwhelm the opponent."

The deck focuses on creatures with efficient mana costs and abilities that help maintain its aggression, while also including cards like Vines of Vastwood for protection and Rancor for additional damage. By curving out early with mana efficient threats and buffing them with pump spells, this deck aims to outpace and overpower the opponent in a 1 vs 1 Pauper format."
