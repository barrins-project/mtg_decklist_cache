It then uses control elements such as counterspells, bounce spells, and card draw to slow down the opponent and disrupt their game plan. The deck also includes recursion spells to bring back key cards from the graveyard and land tutors to find the necessary Tron pieces. The key strategy is to establish a dominant board presence while controlling the opponent's threats to ultimately win the game through card advantage and overwhelming mana advantage."
