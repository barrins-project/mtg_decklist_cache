The deck utilizes card draw and selection to find the combo pieces (Gifts Ungiven, Past in Flames) needed to win the game with a huge Grapeshot. The key strategy is to carefully sequence spells, manage resources, and navigate through disruption to set up the lethal storm turn and overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells."
