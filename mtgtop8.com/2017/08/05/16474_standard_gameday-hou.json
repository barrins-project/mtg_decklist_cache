The deck also includes burn spells like Shock, Incendiary Flow, and Abrade to remove threats and deal direct damage to the opponent. The mana base of Mountains, Ramunap Ruins, and Sunscorched Desert allows for fast and consistent mana production, while also utilizing cards like Bomat Courier and Scavenger Grounds for extra value and disruption. The goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total and secure victory before they can establish their own game plan."
