The deck focuses on manipulating the top of the library with cards like Predict and Counterbalance to control the board and ensure consistent draws. By utilizing a mix of permission spells, removal, and card filtering, this UWx Control deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while establishing its own win conditions to dominate the late game."
