The deck includes a mix of removal spells, card draw, and threats like Metalwork Colossus and Elder Deep-Fiend. By ramping with artifacts like Hedron Archive and Cultivator's Caravan, the deck aims to stabilize the board and outvalue the opponent. Trophy Mage and Glint-Nest Crane help to find key pieces of the deck while Filigree Familiar provides life gain and card draw. The deck's win condition is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats and control the game until victory."
