By using efficient removal like Doom Blade and Chainer's Edict, along with card advantage from Mulldrifter and Sea Gate Oracle, the deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent. Additionally, the inclusion of Ghostly Flicker and Archaeomancer allows for recurring value and flexibility in dealing with threats. The deck's game plan is to stall the opponent's aggression and eventually overwhelm them with powerful spells."

Utilizing cards like Thraben Inspector and Kor Skyfisher for value, along with efficient removal like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, the goal is to control the board while maintaining pressure. By combining artifact synergy with token generation through Kuldotha Rebirth and Battle Screech, the deck can quickly build a formidable board presence. With a mix of burn spells and combat tricks like Rally the Peasants, this Boros Aggro deck aims to close out games swiftly and decisively."
