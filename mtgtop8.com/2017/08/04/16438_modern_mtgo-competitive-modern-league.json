The goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize or establish their own game plan. By playing aggressively and efficiently using cards like Boros Charm, Lightning Bolt, and Goblin Guide, this deck aims to win through direct damage and overwhelming aggression."
