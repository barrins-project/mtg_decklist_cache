            "notes": "The deck focuses on building a fast and aggressive board presence with a swarm of Elves. The key strategy is to ramp up mana quickly with mana dorks like Elvish Mystic and Priest of Titania, while using cards like Birchlore Rangers and Quirion Ranger for additional mana efficiency. Lys Alana Huntmaster and Timberwatch Elf provide powerful payoffs for having a wide board, allowing for explosive turns and overwhelming the opponent. Distant Melody serves as a card draw engine to keep the deck running smoothly. The inclusion of Wellwisher offers some lifegain synergy and survivability."
