By disrupting the opponent's strategy and denying them the ability to draw relevant cards, the deck aims to grind out incremental advantages until it can win the game through Infernal Tutor or other win conditions. The deck also utilizes cards like Pithing Needle and Abrupt Decay to deal with threats and protect its own game plan. With a mix of disruption, card selection, and win conditions, this deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver its opponent."

By using cards like Pyretic Ritual, Manamorphose, and Desperate Ritual, along with Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer to reduce costs, the deck aims to use Grapeshot as a finisher to deal lethal damage to the opponent. Gifts Ungiven is used to tutor for key spells like Past in Flames, allowing the player to cast multiple spells from their graveyard and continue the combo."
