By utilizing spells like Cryptic Command and Path to Exile, as well as planeswalkers like Jace and Gideon, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through incremental advantage. The inclusion of Spreading Seas can also disrupt opponent's mana base, giving the deck additional control over the game. Overall, the key strategy is to control the game and outvalue the opponent through card advantage and removal."
