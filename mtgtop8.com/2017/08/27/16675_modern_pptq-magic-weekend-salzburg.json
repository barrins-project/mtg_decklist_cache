The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early in the game with a combination of aggressive creatures and powerful artifact equipment. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Galvanic Blast for direct damage to finish off the opponent. The key strategy is to maintain a steady stream of threats while leveraging the synergy between artifacts and creatures to outpace the opponent."
