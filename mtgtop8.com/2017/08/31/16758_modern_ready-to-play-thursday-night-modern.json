The deck includes a mix of removal spells and counterspells to control the board, as well as efficient creatures like Geist of Saint Traft and Spell Queller to pressure the opponent. The deck also includes card draw and selection spells to ensure consistent draws and maintain a strong board presence. Finally, the inclusion of Celestial Colonnade provides a powerful finisher to close out games."
