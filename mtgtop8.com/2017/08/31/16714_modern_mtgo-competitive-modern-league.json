The toolbox aspect of the deck comes from cards like Duskwatch Recruiter and Chord of Calling, allowing the player to search for and play key creatures when needed. The deck also includes disruption with Magus of the Moon to disrupt opponent's mana base. It aims to win the game quickly through a powerful combo with efficient creature tutoring."
