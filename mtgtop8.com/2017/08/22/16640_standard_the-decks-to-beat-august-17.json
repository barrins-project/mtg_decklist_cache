By maximizing aggressive creatures like Ahn-Crop Crasher and Earthshaker Khenra, along with powerful finishers like Hazoret the Fervent and Glorybringer, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. With a low mana curve and a focus on speed, this deck aims to close out games quickly."
