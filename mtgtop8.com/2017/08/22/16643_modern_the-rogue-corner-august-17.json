The key strategy is to efficiently search for and play lands to enable the combo pieces while disrupting opponents with cards like Haze of Pollen. Utilizing cards like Chancellor of the Tangle and Lay of the Land, the deck aims to quickly assemble its pieces and overwhelm the opponent with a powerful combo finish."
