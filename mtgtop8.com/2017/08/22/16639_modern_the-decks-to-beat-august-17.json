The deck aims to win quickly by applying relentless pressure and leveraging the power of Death's Shadow to overwhelm opponents before they have a chance to stabilize."

The inclusion of cards like Shrine of Burning Rage and Searing Blaze provide additional value and flexibility in dealing damage. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently, leveraging its mana base and card advantage to win the game before the opponent can establish their own strategy."
