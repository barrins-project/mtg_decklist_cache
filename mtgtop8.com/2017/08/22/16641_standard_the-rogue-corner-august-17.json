By chaining card draw and cycling effects together, you can generate a ton of mana with Weirding Wood and cast Approach of the Second Sun multiple times in a single turn to win the game. Haze of Pollen and Renewed Faith help you stall the game until you can assemble your combo pieces, while Shadow of the Grave allows you to recycle key cards back into your hand."
