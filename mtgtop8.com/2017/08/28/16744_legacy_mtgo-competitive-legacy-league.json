It utilizes cards like Thalia and Sanctum Prelate to slow down the opponent, while Stoneforge Mystic fetches powerful equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice. Aether Vial is used to cheat creatures onto the battlefield and provide additional disruption. The deck also has a strong mana denial plan with cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port, ensuring opponents struggle to play their spells effectively. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm opponents with a combination of disruption and aggressive threats."
