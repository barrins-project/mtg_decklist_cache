This is achieved by having Midnight Guard on the battlefield and then enchanting it with Presence of Gond, which creates a 1/1 Elf Warrior token. Whenever the token is created, it untaps the Midnight Guard, allowing you to repeat the process and generate an unlimited number of Elf Warrior tokens. This combo can be supported by cards like Soul Warden and Soul's Attendant, which gain life whenever a creature enters the battlefield, and cards like Cenn's Enlistment and Battle Screech, which create multiple creature tokens."

By utilizing artifacts such as Springleaf Drum, Prophetic Prism, and Chromatic Star, the deck aims to quickly assemble a powerful board presence while also having removal options with Galvanic Blast. The inclusion of cards like Fling and Temur Battle Rage offer the possibility to close out games with surprise burst damage."
