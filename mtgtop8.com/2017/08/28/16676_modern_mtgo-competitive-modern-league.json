Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish the opponent for playing non-creature spells, while Atarka's Command and Boros Charm provide additional reach and flexibility. The mana base is optimized for consistent land drops and color requirements, allowing for a streamlined and efficient aggro strategy focused on dealing damage as quickly as possible."
