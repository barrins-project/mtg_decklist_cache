By playing cheap, efficient threats like Delver of Secrets and Young Pyromancer, the deck aims to quickly apply pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The deck also utilizes card selection and card advantage engines like Ponder, Brainstorm, and Gitaxian Probe to maintain consistency and stay ahead in resources. The mana base is streamlined to support the aggressive game plan with efficient lands like Wasteland and fetchlands."

The deck also includes disruptive spells like Daze, Force of Will, and Stifle to control the game and protect its threats. By combining efficient threats with powerful disruption, this deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent and secure a victory before they have a chance to stabilize. Additionally, the deck includes a reanimation package with Reanimate to bring back key threats from the graveyard."
