By applying early pressure and disrupting opponents' game plans, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm opponents and secure a victory before they can stabilize. Additionally, the inclusion of powerful creatures like Gurmag Angler and Deathrite Shaman adds flexibility and additional threats to the aggressive game plan."

It includes cards like Dark Ritual and Lion's Eye Diamond to generate mana quickly, combined with tutor spells like Infernal Tutor to search for key combo pieces like Tendrils of Agony or Ad Nauseam. The deck also includes disruptive spells like Cabal Therapy and Duress to disrupt the opponent's hand and protect its own combo. Overall, the goal is to cast a large number of spells in a single turn to create a lethal storm count."
