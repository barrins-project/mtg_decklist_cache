            "notes": "The main concept behind this Dimir Control deck is to use a mix of removal spells, counterspells, and card draw to control the opponent's board while gradually building card advantage through efficient creatures like Mulldrifter and Gurmag Angler. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by denying key spells and creatures, while also providing card advantage to ensure a steady stream of threats and answers. The deck excels at out-valuing opponents in the long game and disrupting their plan with a combination of removal and counterspells."
