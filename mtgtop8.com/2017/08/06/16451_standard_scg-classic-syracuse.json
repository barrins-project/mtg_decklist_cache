The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thalia, Heretic Cathar and Abrade. As the game progresses, the deck can finish off the opponent with powerful finishers like Hazoret the Fervent and Archangel Avacyn. The mana base is built to support the aggressive strategy while ensuring consistent mana sources for casting spells."
