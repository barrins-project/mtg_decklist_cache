The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Fatal Push, while protecting your own game plan with counterspells like Remand. Geist of Saint Traft and Zur the Enchanter provide powerful threats that can quickly end the game if not dealt with. Spreading Seas and Steel of the Godhead can also help in breaking down the opponent's defenses."

Once Valakut is on the field, the deck aims to play Primeval Titan to fetch multiple copies of Valakut and deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent. The inclusion of Pia and Kiran Nalaar provides additional value with creature tokens, while Lightning Bolt and Sweltering Suns offer removal and temporary control over the board. The key strategy is to assemble the combo pieces quickly and efficiently to overwhelm the opponent."
