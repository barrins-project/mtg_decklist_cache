It also utilizes card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation and Snapcaster Mage. The win condition comes from planeswalkers like Gideon of the Trials and Jura, along with Celestial Colonnade as a backup win condition. The deck aims to outlast the opponent, control the game's tempo, and eventually win through card advantage and powerful planeswalker abilities."
