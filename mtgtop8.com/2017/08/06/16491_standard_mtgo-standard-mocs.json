The deck also includes cards that provide energy like Servant of the Conduit and Whirler Virtuoso to power up its energy-dependent cards. By maintaining a steady stream of threats and removal, the deck aims to outpace the opponent and secure victory through consistent pressure."

The removal spells like Grasp of Darkness and Fatal Push help to control the board while cards like Relentless Dead and Kalitas provide additional threats and value. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a horde of zombies while applying pressure and maintaining card advantage through Cryptbreaker and Ifnir Deadlands. Westvale Abbey provides a potent win condition when the board is stalled."

By repeatedly using Refurbish to cheat creatures into play, combined with cards like Strategic Planning to stock the graveyard, the deck aims to quickly establish board presence and put pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of creatures like Thraben Inspector and Sunscourge Champion provides early game stability, while Cataclysmic Gearhulk and Angel of Invention offer additional power and versatility to close out games efficiently."
