The deck also includes cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Abrupt Decay to protect itself while setting up its lock. By manipulating the opponent's draws and denying them resources, the deck aims to grind out victory through attrition and ultimately control the game to its advantage. The key strategy revolves around locking down the opponent's options and gaining incremental advantage to secure victory."

The key strategy is to efficiently deal damage and prevent the opponent from gaining life or stabilizing the board. By maintaining a fast-paced and relentless tempo, this deck aims to secure victory before the opponent has a chance to mount a strong defense. Key cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel, Goblin Guide, and Lightning Bolt help to maintain pressure and control the pace of the game, ultimately leading to a swift and decisive win."
