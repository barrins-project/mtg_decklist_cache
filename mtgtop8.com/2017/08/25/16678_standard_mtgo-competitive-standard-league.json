Cards like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Chandra, Flamecaller are used as finishers, with support from removal spells like Hour of Devastation and Abrade. The deck also includes ways to search for key pieces like Beneath the Sands and Hour of Promise. Overall, the strategy is to outpace the opponent in mana production while controlling the board until the big threats can come down and dominate the game."
