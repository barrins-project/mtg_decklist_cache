By utilizing cards such as Enter the Infinite and Cunning Wish, the deck aims to draw through the deck rapidly and overwhelm opponents with its combo potential. With a mixture of control elements like Force of Will and Spell Pierce, as well as card filtering effects like Brainstorm and Ponder, the deck is designed to consistently execute its powerful combo plays while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
