This enables the player to then win the game by casting Lightning Storm and discarding lands to deal damage to their opponent. The deck also includes cards to help dig for the combo pieces (Serum Visions, Sleight of Hand) and protect the combo (Pact of Negation). The key is to assemble the combo pieces quickly and efficiently to secure victory."

By utilizing a combination of auras and hexproof creatures like Slippery Bogle and Gladecover Scout, this deck excels at aggressive plays in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."

By removing threats from the opponent's board with cards like Fatal Push and Detention Sphere, and disrupting their hand with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, the deck aims to out-value opponents in the long game. The inclusion of Lingering Souls and planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil provide additional threats and card advantage, while cards like Spreading Seas can disrupt opponents' mana bases. Overall, the deck focuses on control and attrition to grind out wins."
