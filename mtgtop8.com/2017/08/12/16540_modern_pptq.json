The deck also includes disruptive creatures like Spell Queller and Vendilion Clique to control the board and protect your own creatures. Collected Company allows you to dig for more threats and surprise your opponent with additional creatures. The mana base is built to support these creatures with a mix of fetch lands and dual lands. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient creature-based offense."

By using cards like Street Wraith and Thought Scour to lower your life and fill your graveyard, along with disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, you can control the game while pressuring your opponent with efficient threats like Gurmag Angler and Tasigur, the Golden Fang. The deck aims to disrupt and outpace opponents through a combination of aggression and disruption."
