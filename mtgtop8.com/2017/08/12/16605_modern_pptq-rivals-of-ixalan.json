The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering their spells and removing their creatures with cards such as Cryptic Command, Mana Leak, and Detention Sphere. It also aims to stall the game and survive through board wipes like Supreme Verdict and protect its own life total with cards like Condemn and Path to Exile. The deck utilizes card draw and selection options like Serum Visions and Sphinx's Revelation to find the necessary answers and extend the game."

By efficiently using cards that fill up the graveyard and powerful creatures with a low mana cost, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize. It's a high-risk, high-reward deck that requires precise decision-making and knowledge of the meta."

It utilizes cards like Primeval Titan and Scapeshift to search for and put multiple mountains into play, increasing the damage output of Valakut. The deck also includes cards like Farseek and Sakura-Tribe Elder to accelerate land drops and Khalni Heart Expedition to further ramp mana. Overall, the goal is to assemble the combo pieces quickly and deal massive damage to the opponent in a short amount of time."
