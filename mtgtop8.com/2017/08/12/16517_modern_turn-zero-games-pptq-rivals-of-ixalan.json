By utilizing cards like Noble Hierarch and Wild Nacatl to ramp into powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Loxodon Smiter, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out games before the opponent can stabilize. Collected Company provides additional card advantage and allows for explosive turns, while cards like Knight of the Reliquary and Voice of Resurgence offer additional utility and disruption. Overall, the deck focuses on fast, proactive plays to win the game quickly."

The deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero by deploying powerful creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Guide, and Eidolon of the Great Revel. The deck is focused on putting pressure on the opponent and ending the game quickly through a combination of direct damage and creature aggression."

With cards like Cryptic Command, Detention Sphere, and Path to Exile, it aims to maintain board control while drawing cards and generating incremental advantage. The deck also utilizes planeswalkers like Jace and Gideon for additional utility and win conditions. By systematically controlling the game and out-valuing opponents, UW Control aims to grind out victories through careful resource management and strategic decision-making."
