Then, by sacrificing lands and searching for more Mountains with Scapeshift, the player can deal a massive amount of damage to their opponent by triggering Valakut's ability. The deck also includes Primeval Titan for additional ramp and Chandra, Torch of Defiance for card advantage and burn damage. The key concept of this deck is to efficiently combo off and overwhelm the opponent with Valakut triggers."

The deck also includes control elements like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Oblivion Stone to manage the board and handle threats. The deck aims to outvalue and outscale opponents in the mid to late game, using its mana advantage to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
