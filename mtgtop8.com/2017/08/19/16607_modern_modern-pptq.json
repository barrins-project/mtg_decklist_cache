By utilizing cards like Aether Vial and Chalice of the Void, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while keeping a steady stream of Merfolk creatures on the battlefield. Cards like Spreading Seas and Mutavault offer additional disruption and synergy with the deck's tribal theme. Master of Waves and other Merfolk lords provide a powerful boost to the team, enabling the deck to quickly build a board presence and apply pressure to the opponent."

Gifts Ungiven allows for flexibility in finding key cards, while Lingering Souls provides a source of recurring threats. The deck also includes versatile planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy for additional card advantage and control options."

The deck aims to ramp up mana with Mind Stone and Koth of the Hammer to play powerful threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Chandra, Torch of Defiance. The inclusion of Eternal Scourge provides resilience against removal and the ability to recur threats. The deck also features some equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine for additional versatility and power."
