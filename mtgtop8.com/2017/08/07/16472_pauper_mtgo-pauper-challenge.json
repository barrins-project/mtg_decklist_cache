The deck utilizes efficient card draw and filtering with Ponder, Brainstorm, and Thought Scour to maintain tempo and find key pieces. Exhume is used to cheat out big creatures from the graveyard, providing a strong advantage. The addition of Ash Barrens helps fix mana while Dismal Backwater provides some life gain in a fast-paced aggro strategy."

By utilizing cards like Chittering Rats and Cuombajj Witches to disrupt the opponent's hand and board state, alongside powerful finishers like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Crypt Rats, this deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's resources and finish them off before they can stabilize. With a mix of aggressive creatures, removal spells, and card advantage options, this deck seeks to maintain pressure and control throughout the game."
