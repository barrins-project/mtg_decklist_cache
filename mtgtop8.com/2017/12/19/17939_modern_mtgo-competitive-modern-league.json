The deck utilizes cards like Life from the Loam, Faithless Looting, and Cathartic Reunion to fuel its graveyard recursion strategy, while also using cards like Conflagrate and Insolent Neonate to deal direct damage to the opponent. The deck aims to win the game by overwhelming the opponent with a powerful board presence and graveyard recursion."

The key strategy is to use Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer to reduce the cost of spells, while casting Gifts Ungiven to search for win conditions like Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens. Past in Flames allows the player to reuse their spells from the graveyard, while Remand provides some disruption for the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to quickly assemble the necessary cards to storm off and win the game in one explosive turn."
