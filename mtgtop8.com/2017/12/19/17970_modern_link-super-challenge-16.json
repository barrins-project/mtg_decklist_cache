The deck focuses on creating an aggressive board presence with cards like Raise the Alarm, Gather the Townsfolk, and Spectral Procession boosted by cards like Intangible Virtue and Honor of the Pure. In addition, the deck includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Path to Exile, as well as hand disruption with Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's plans and secure victory through overwhelming force."
