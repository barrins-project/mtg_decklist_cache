            "notes": "The deck aims to dominate the game by using a combination of powerful planeswalkers and equipment to control the board. It focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy through hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and countermagic like Force of Will, while also generating card advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Brainstorm. The Stoneforge Mystic package allows for powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Batterskull to be quickly deployed, turning the tide of the game in the control player's favor. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color-intensive spells while also providing utility with cards like Wasteland."
