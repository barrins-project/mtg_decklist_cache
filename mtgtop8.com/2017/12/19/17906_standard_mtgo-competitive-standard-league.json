The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful, buffed-up creatures and deal massive amounts of damage in a short amount of time. Cards like Invigorated Rampage and Fling can help to push through for lethal damage, while cards like Bristling Hydra and Blossoming Defense provide protection for your creatures. Overall, it's a fast-paced aggressive strategy that aims to win the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
