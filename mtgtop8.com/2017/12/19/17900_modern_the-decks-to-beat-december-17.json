Gifts Ungiven is a crucial card for assembling the combo pieces needed to win the game, while Grapeshot serves as a finisher once a high storm count is achieved."

            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the board and ramp up mana quickly in order to achieve a powerful combo using Scapeshift and Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle. By searching for and playing multiple lands, the deck can deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent by sacrificing lands and triggering Valakut's ability. Primeval Titan and Sakura-Tribe Elder help with ramp and getting the necessary lands on the battlefield, while cards like Lightning Bolt provide removal and protection. The deck aims to win through a big burst of damage in the late game."
