By using cards like Delver of Secrets, Young Pyromancer, Grim Lavamancer, and True-Name Nemesis along with a suite of powerful instants like Lightning Bolt, Force of Will, and Daze, the goal is to quickly overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a strong board presence. The deck relies on a combination of tempo plays and burn spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building up its own board presence for a quick victory."
