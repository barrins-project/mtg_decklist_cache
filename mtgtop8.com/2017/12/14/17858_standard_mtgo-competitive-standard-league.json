By utilizing cards like Attune with Aether and Servant of the Conduit to ramp up mana, the deck aims to quickly put pressure on the opponent with efficient threats like Longtusk Cub, Rogue Refiner, and Glorybringer. The deck also includes cards like Whirler Virtuoso and Bristling Hydra for additional energy generation and protection. Overall, the goal is to maintain a tempo advantage and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
