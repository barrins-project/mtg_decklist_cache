It also aims to disrupt opponents' strategies by using cards like Blood Moon and Ensnaring Bridge to slow them down. The deck utilizes aggressive creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster to pressure opponents and control cards like Chalice of the Void to disrupt their game plan. The overall goal is to overwhelm opponents with fast, aggressive plays while hindering their ability to respond effectively."
