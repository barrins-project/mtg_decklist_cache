By playing efficient threats like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Stoneforge Mystic alongside disruptive creatures like Phyrexian Revoker and Mother of Runes, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while establishing a strong board presence. With access to powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Sword of Fire and Ice, the deck can quickly close out games and maintain pressure on the opponent. Additionally, land disruption with cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port helps to disrupt the opponent's mana base and slow down their game plan."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach, while also generating card advantage with cards like Baleful Strix and Snapcaster Mage. The deck can also apply pressure with versatile creatures like Deathrite Shaman and Leovold, Emissary of Trest, while utilizing the mana denial strategy with cards like Wasteland."
