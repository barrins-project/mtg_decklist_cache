By playing powerful creatures like Hazoret the Fervent and Earthshaker Khenra early in the game and following up with burn spells like Shock and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. The inclusion of cards like Rampaging Ferocidon and Ahn-Crop Crasher helps to maintain pressure on the opponent while cards like Bomat Courier provide card advantage. The deck's mana base is designed for consistency and efficiency, allowing the deck to consistently apply pressure and close out games quickly."
