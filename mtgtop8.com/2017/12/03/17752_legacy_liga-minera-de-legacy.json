Chalice of the Void and Wasteland provide disruption to slow down the opponent's game plan while cards like Karakas and Umezawa's Jitte help to deal with problematic creatures. The goal is to establish board presence and apply pressure early on to secure a swift victory."

The strategy revolves around cheating out powerful, game-winning creatures such as Iona, Shield of Emeria and Griselbrand early in the game. The deck also includes disruption in the form of counterspells like Force of Will and Daze, as well as removal spells like Collective Brutality. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and disrupt their game plan to secure victory."
