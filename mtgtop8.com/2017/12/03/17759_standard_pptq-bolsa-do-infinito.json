The goal is to quickly build up energy, play Pummeler, and use pump spells to make it a lethal threat. Cards like Larger Than Life and Cartouche of Knowledge help to increase Pummeler's power, while cards like Attune with Aether and Servant of the Conduit help to generate the necessary energy. Rhonas the Indomitable and Bristling Hydra provide additional threats and resilience to removal spells. The deck aims to win the game quickly by overwhelming the opponent with big, pumped-up creatures."
