By using cards like Sneak Attack and Omniscience, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The deck also includes counterspells like Flusterstorm and Force of Will to protect its combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, the deck includes card draw spells like Brainstorm and Preordain to help find its key combo pieces."

The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Force of Will, Daze, and Wasteland, while also establishing a strong board presence with Stoneforge Mystic and powerful equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte. True-Name Nemesis is a key threat that is difficult to deal with, and cards like Leovold, Emissary of Trest and Vendilion Clique provide additional disruption and card advantage. Jace, the Mind Sculptor offers additional card selection and inevitability in longer games."
