The combination of efficient threats like Glint-Sleeve Siphoner and Whirler Virtuoso with powerful value engines like The Scarab God and Gonti, Lord of Luxury allows for versatile playstyles. The deck is able to apply pressure early on and pivot into a more controlling strategy as the game progresses, maintaining a proactive stance throughout. Additionally, the mana base is carefully constructed to support the diverse color requirements of the spells in the deck."
