Gifts Ungiven is used to search for key combo pieces like Past in Flames or additional rituals. The deck aims to be fast and explosive, overwhelming the opponent with a flurry of spells."

This combo can then be followed up with a win condition such as Laboratory Maniac or Lightning Storm. The deck focuses on manipulating mana with cards like Lotus Bloom and Pentad Prism, while using cantrips like Sleight of Hand and Serum Visions to find the necessary combo pieces. The deck also includes Pact of Negation for protection and consistency."

The goal is to assemble enough mana and card advantage to cast a lethal Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens to win the game on the spot. Gifts Ungiven helps find key pieces of the combo, while Past in Flames allows for recursion of spells from the graveyard. The deck aims to quickly storm off and overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells."
