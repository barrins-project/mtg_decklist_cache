By utilizing mana acceleration from cards like Birchlore Rangers, Llanowar Elves, and Priest of Titania, the deck aims to flood the board with high synergy creatures such as Lys Alana Huntmaster and Timberwatch Elf. Cards like Wellwisher and Essence Warden help to gain life and stabilize against aggressive opponents. Distant Melody and Lead the Stampede provide card advantage, while Viridian Longbow offers removal options. The deck's strength lies in its speed and ability to overwhelm opponents with a strong board presence."
