The deck aims to stall the game with cards like Moment's Peace and Dinrova Horror, while also generating card advantage with Mulldrifter and Mnemonic Wall. The deck utilizes Ghostly Flicker to repeat powerful enter-the-battlefield effects, and uses Mystical Teachings to search for key answers. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent with efficient control cards and eventually overwhelm them with powerful spells and abilities."
