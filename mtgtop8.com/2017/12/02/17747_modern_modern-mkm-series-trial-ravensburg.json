By denying the opponent access to the cards they need, while also protecting yourself with Ensnaring Bridge and Leyline of Sanctity, you can slowly grind them down until they run out of resources. The deck also includes disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to further hinder the opponent's plans, making it difficult for them to mount a successful offense."
