The deck focuses on using blue and white spells to interact with the opponent's threats and answer them efficiently. The deck also includes ways to draw cards, manipulate the top of the library, and protect its key cards. Overall, the goal is to outlast the opponent and grind out a win through careful decision-making and resource management."
