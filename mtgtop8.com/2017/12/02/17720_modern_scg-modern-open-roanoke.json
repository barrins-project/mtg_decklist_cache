            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to ramp up mana quickly using spells like Farseek and Search for Tomorrow, while controlling the board with removal like Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods. The ultimate goal is to cast Scapeshift to search for Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and a critical mass of Mountains to deal a large amount of damage to the opponent in one turn. Primeval Titan and Mwonvuli Acid-Moss help with ramping up and finding lands, while Chandra, Flamecaller provides additional board control and card advantage. Relic of Progenitus helps disrupt graveyard strategies."
