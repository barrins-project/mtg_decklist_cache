            "notes": "The primary focus of this deck is to quickly deal damage to the opponent using low-cost burn spells and aggressive creatures with haste. The strategy revolves around maintaining a fast tempo and pressuring the opponent to close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. Cards like Soul-Scar Mage, Rampaging Ferocidon, and Hazoret the Fervent contribute to a relentless assault, with additional reach provided by burn spells like Shock and Lightning Strike. The inclusion of powerful planeswalker Chandra, Torch of Defiance adds versatility and additional burn potential to the deck."
