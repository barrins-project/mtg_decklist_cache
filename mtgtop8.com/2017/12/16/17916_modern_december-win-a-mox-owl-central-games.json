The deck also includes a suite of disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt your opponent's game plan while protecting your own creatures with Stubborn Denial. The deck also includes burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to help clear the way for your creatures to attack. Snapcaster Mage provides additional value by allowing you to reuse key spells from your graveyard."
