By utilizing efficient removal like Swords to Plowshares and equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Sword of Fire and Ice, you can quickly pressure your opponent and close out the game. The deck also has a strong toolbox element with Recruiter of the Guard to find key creatures like Mirran Crusader or Sanctum Prelate as needed."

The deck also includes disruptive elements like Cabal Therapy to disrupt your opponent's strategy and protect your combo. The key strategy is to efficiently cycle through your deck and set up explosive plays from your graveyard."
