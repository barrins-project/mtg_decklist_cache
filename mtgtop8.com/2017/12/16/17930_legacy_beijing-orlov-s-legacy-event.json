By casting multiple spells in a single turn, the player can finish off their opponent with Tendrils of Agony or Empty the Warrens. Additionally, disruptive spells like Duress and Cabal Therapy help to disrupt the opponent's game plan, allowing the combo player to go off unhindered. This deck is highly dependent on careful sequencing and efficient play to achieve victory."
