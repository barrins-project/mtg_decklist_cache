By utilizing low-cost creatures like Adanto Vanguard and Earthshaker Khenra, combined with burn spells like Lightning Strike, the deck aims to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. Cards like Hazoret the Fervent and Trial of Solidarity add additional power to the board, while utilizing cards like Shefet Dunes and Ramunap Ruins for extra reach and damage. With a focus on efficient creatures and direct damage, this deck looks to close out games quickly."
