By utilizing cheap, evasive threats like Delver of Secrets and Faerie Miscreant, as well as disruption cards like Spellstutter Sprite and Vapor Snag, the deck can apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to establish early board presence and tempo advantage, while keeping the opponent on the back foot with counter magic."
