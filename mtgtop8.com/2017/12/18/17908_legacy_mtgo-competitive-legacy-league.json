It also aims to control the game with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana of the Veil, while utilizing the powerful graveyard interaction of Deathrite Shaman. The deck is built to have a strong early game presence with aggressive plays like Hymn to Tourach and Abrupt Decay, while also having the flexibility to adapt to different matchups with a mix of removal and countermagic."
