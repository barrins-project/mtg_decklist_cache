The deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent early on with aggressive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Ninja of the Deep Hours while maintaining card advantage through cantrips like Preordain and Ponder. The inclusion of Counterspell and Skred helps the deck to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own threats."
