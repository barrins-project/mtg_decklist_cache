The deck is also able to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Stubborn Denial, while providing card advantage and versatility with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Kolaghan's Command. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and force the opponent into difficult positions while maintaining control of the game."
