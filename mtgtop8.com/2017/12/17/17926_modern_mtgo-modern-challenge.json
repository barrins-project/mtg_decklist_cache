Once you have drawn your entire deck, you can win the game by either casting Lightning Storm with enough lands in play or by playing Laboratory Maniac and drawing a card to win through its alternate win condition. The deck focuses on efficient card selection, mana ramp, and protection to assemble the combo pieces quickly and effectively."

It relies on countering spells, bouncing or removing threats, and disrupting the opponent's mana base. The deck also utilizes the combo of Through the Breach and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn to quickly close out the game. Blood Moon is included to further disrupt the opponent's mana base and increase the control player's advantage. This UR Control deck aims to maintain control of the game while efficiently dealing with threats and eventually winning through a strong combo."
