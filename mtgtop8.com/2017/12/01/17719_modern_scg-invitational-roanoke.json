The deck then aims to cast multiple spells in a turn, leveraging the cost reduction from Goblin Electromancer and Baral, Chief of Compliance, to ultimately finish the opponent off with a massive Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens."

By utilizing a mix of powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Huntmaster of the Fells, along with versatile spells like Lightning Bolt and Cryptic Command, the deck aims to establish an early advantage and maintain board control. Additionally, cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy provide card advantage and flexibility, while mana denial cards like Blood Moon can disrupt the opponent's game plan."
