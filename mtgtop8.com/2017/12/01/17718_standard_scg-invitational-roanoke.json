            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly generate energy and deploy efficient threats to apply pressure on the opponent. By utilizing cards like Attune with Aether and Servant of the Conduit, the deck can ramp up mana and power out big creatures like Glorybringer and Bristling Hydra. This aggressive strategy is supported by interaction spells like Abrade and Harnessed Lightning to remove blockers or deal with threats. The Temur colors provide a good balance of aggression and resilience, making this deck a formidable force in Standard 1 vs 1 matchups."
