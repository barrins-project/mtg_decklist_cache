Thraben Inspector and Prophetic Prism provide card advantage, while Palace Sentinels helps maintain card advantage by allowing the player to draw extra cards. Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast are used as removal spells to eliminate threats, while cards like Glint Hawk and Kor Skyfisher provide aggressive creatures that can be recurred for additional value. The deck also utilizes some token generation with Battle Screech and Cenn's Enlistment."
