The deck also aims to control the board with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Abrupt Decay. Liliana of the Veil and Kolaghan's Command provide additional disruption and value. The mana base is designed to consistently provide the necessary black, red, and green mana for the deck's spells. Ultimately, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive threats and disruption."
