This allows the player to consistently cast powerful Eldrazi creatures like Ulamog's Crusher and efficiently power up spells like Rolling Thunder for a game-winning finish. The deck also features a mix of card draw, mana fixing, and creature recursion to ensure a steady stream of threats and answers. By assembling the Urza Tron lands early in the game, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its powerful late-game plays."

It aims to keep the opponent's board clear while drawing cards and generating incremental advantages. The deck also utilizes bounce lands to ensure it hits its land drops and can repeatedly use powerful spells. By controlling the game and out-valuing the opponent, this deck seeks to grind out victories through attrition and strategic decision-making."
