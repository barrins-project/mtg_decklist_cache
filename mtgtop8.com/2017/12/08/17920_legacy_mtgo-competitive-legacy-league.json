The deck utilizes mana accelerants like rituals and mana-producing creatures with additional sources of mana from zero-cost artifacts and mana-producing lands. The deck also includes Burning Wish to tutor for additional win conditions or disruption cards as needed. The goal is to win the game quickly before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
