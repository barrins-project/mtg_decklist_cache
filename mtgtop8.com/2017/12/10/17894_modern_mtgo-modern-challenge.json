The deck uses cards like Remand, Spell Snare, and Cryptic Command to control the pace of the game, while also utilizing Lightning Bolt and Electrolyze for removal. The deck also includes card draw with Serum Visions and Pull from Tomorrow, and utilizes Snapcaster Mage to recast key spells. Blood Moon provides additional disruption against opponent's mana bases."
