The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast combo finish, utilizing cards like Wirewood Symbiote and Nettle Sentinel to create a powerful board presence and combo off efficiently. The synergy between these cards allows for a strong and consistent combo strategy."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's mana base with cards like Wasteland and Ghost Quarter while also taking advantage of lands like Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage to generate powerful threats. Life from the Loam is used to recur lands from the graveyard, allowing for consistent land drops and ensuring access to the necessary mana sources. Overall, this deck aims to slowly grind out the opponent by depriving them of resources and overwhelming them with powerful land-based threats."
