By recurring value creatures like Golgari Brownscale and Stinkweed Imp, along with utility creatures like Spore Frog and Crypt Rats, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents in a grindy game. The deck also features a small reanimation package with cards like Grim Harvest and Grave Scrabbler to further supplement its game plan."
