With efficient creatures like Snapcaster Mage and True-Name Nemesis, the deck aims to maintain board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional card advantage and manipulation, further solidifying the control aspect of the deck. Overall, the deck focuses on outlasting the opponent and establishing dominance through its powerful spells and creatures."
