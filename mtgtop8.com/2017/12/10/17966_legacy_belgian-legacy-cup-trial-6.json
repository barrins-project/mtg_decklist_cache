The key strategy involves using cards like Portent and Ponder to set up favorable draws, while leveraging powerful cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Snapcaster Mage to provide card advantage and control the game. The deck also includes a win condition in the form of Monastery Mentor, supporting a balance of control and proactive threats. Additionally, Terminus serves as a powerful board wipe option to reset the battlefield when needed."
