This is achieved through cards like Gifts Ungiven to search for combo pieces, Baral and Goblin Electromancer to reduce mana costs, and rituals to generate mana quickly. The deck aims to set up a solid board state by casting cantrips like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to ensure consistency in drawing through the deck and finding the necessary cards to win the game."
