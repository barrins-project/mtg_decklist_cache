By utilizing versatile cards like Snapcaster Mage and Kolaghan's Command, the deck can adapt to different situations and outvalue the opponent over time. Leovold, Emissary of Trest provides additional card advantage while punishing opponents for drawing cards, creating a difficult board state for the opponent to overcome."

It also includes a variety of card draw and manipulation spells like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain to help find the combo pieces while also running counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect the combo. The deck aims to win the game by overwhelming the opponent with massive threats before they have a chance to respond."
