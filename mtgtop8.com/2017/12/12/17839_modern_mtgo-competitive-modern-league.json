            "notes": "The deck focuses on playing aggressively with Death's Shadow as the centerpiece of the strategy. The deck aims to quickly reduce its own life total to make Death's Shadow a big threat on the battlefield, while disrupting the opponent's hand with Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, and using removal spells like Fatal Push and Terminate to clear the way for attacks. Additionally, the deck has ways to pump up Death's Shadow's power and trample damage with cards like Temur Battle Rage and Tarfire, while also providing card advantage and flexibility with cards like Kolaghan's Command and Traverse the Ulvenwald."
