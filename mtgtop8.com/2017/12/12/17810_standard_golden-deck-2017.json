With synergies from Winding Constrictor and Rishkar, Peema Renegade, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with an aggressive strategy. Additionally, cards like Rogue Refiner and Hostage Taker provide extra value and options during gameplay. The mana base allows for consistent casting of spells while providing flexibility in color requirements. The inclusion of The Scarab God offers a powerful late-game threat and recursion potential."
