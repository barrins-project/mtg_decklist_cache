The deck aims to cast spells like Gifts Ungiven to search for combo pieces like Grapeshot and Past in Flames, allowing the player to generate a large storm count and deal lethal damage to the opponent. The deck also includes cantrips like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to help dig for key combo pieces and ensure consistency in its execution."
