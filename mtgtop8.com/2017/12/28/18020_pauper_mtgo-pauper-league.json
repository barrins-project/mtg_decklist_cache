Cards like Timberwatch Elf and Elvish Vanguard provide ways to pump up the creatures and swing for lethal damage. Lead the Stampede and Distant Melody help draw more elves to keep up the pressure. Overall, the key idea is to swarm the opponent with a fast and powerful elf army."

With a low mana curve and aggressive game plan, this deck aims to beat down opponents before they can stabilize."
