The deck also includes Primeval Titan to search for more lands and trigger Valakut's ability multiple times. Prismatic Omen helps ensure all lands count as mountains for Valakut's effect. Anger of the Gods helps control the board while Lightning Bolt provides additional removal and reach. Overall, the goal is to combo off and win the game quickly."

It includes counter spells like Condescend and Remand to disrupt opponents' game plans, along with removal like Oblivion Stone and Cyclonic Rift. The deck also includes big finishers like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Wurmcoil Engine to close out games. With a mix of card draw, mana acceleration, control elements, and strong win conditions, the deck aims to outlast and outvalue opponents in a longer game."
