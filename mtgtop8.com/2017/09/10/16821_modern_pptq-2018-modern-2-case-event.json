The deck also includes cards like Oblivion Stone and Pyroclasm to control the board, along with Ghost Quarter and Bojuka Bog for disruption. The goal is to control the game until the deck can deploy its big threats and overwhelm the opponent."

By utilizing cards like Goblin Guide, Monastery Swiftspear, and Eidolon of the Great Revel alongside powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Boros Charm, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react quickly. The mana base is optimized for consistent early game aggression, allowing the deck to consistently deal damage and close out games before the opponent can establish a strong board presence."
