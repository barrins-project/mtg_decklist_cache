It also utilizes disruptive cards like Chalice of the Void and Blood Moon to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The planeswalkers Gideon Jura and Chandra, Torch of Defiance provide additional control elements and card advantage. The deck aims to stall the game until it can cast Emrakul, the Aeons Torn to close out the game."
