With a mix of aggressive creatures and powerful planeswalkers, the deck aims to win the game through a combination of token pressure and strategic plays."

The inclusion of cards like Mox Opal and Glimmervoid allows for fast mana acceleration, while cards like Etched Champion and Master of Etherium provide additional threats and resilience on the battlefield. The deck also utilizes lands like Inkmoth Nexus and Blinkmoth Nexus for alternative win conditions."
