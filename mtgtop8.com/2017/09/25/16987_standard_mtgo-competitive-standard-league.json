The deck aims to maintain aggression and tempo with cards like Whirler Virtuoso and Verdurous Gearhulk, while also having some removal options like Shock and Abrade. The inclusion of The Scarab God provides a powerful late-game threat that can help close out the game. Overall, the deck focuses on a fast, aggressive strategy with solid mid-to-late-game options."
