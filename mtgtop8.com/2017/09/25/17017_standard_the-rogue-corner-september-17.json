The deck focuses on quickly building a strong battlefield with cards like Thraben Inspector and Glint-Sleeve Siphoner, while also providing removal with Harnessed Lightning and Declaration in Stone. By combining efficient creatures with powerful support cards, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents and secure victory through aggressive plays and timely removal."
