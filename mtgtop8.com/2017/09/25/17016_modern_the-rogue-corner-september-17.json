The primary win condition is to use Goblin Charbelcher to deal damage directly to the opponent by revealing the top cards of the library. The deck is able to consistently find and play key pieces through card draw and tutoring spells, while also utilizing fog effects like Haze of Pollen to protect itself until it can assemble its combo pieces and win the game."
