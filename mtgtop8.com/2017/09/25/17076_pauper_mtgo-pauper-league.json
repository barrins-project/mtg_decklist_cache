By utilizing cheap creatures with evasion abilities like Skarrgan Pit-Skulk and Silhana Ledgewalker, and utilizing mana-efficient spells like Rancor and Elephant Guide, this mono green aggro deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent and force them to react defensively. With a focus on early aggression and resilience through hexproof and regeneration abilities, the deck seeks to capitalize on its quick starts to secure a victory before the opponent can stabilize."
