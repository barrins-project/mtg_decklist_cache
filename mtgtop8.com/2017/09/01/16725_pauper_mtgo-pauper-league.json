By getting out multiple cheap creatures like Atog, Carapace Forger, Frogmite, and Myr Enforcer, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive game plan. Thoughtcast allows for efficient card draw, while cards like Fling, Galvanic Blast, and Temur Battle Rage provide ways to close out the game quickly. The deck also includes mana fixing with cards like Ancient Den, Darksteel Citadel, and Prophetic Prism to ensure smooth gameplay."
