The deck aims to maintain control of the board with efficient removal like Fatal Push and Kolaghan's Command, while also generating card advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Leovold, Emissary of Trest. By disrupting the opponent's resources and game plan, the deck can slowly grind out a win through card advantage and efficient threats like Gurmag Angler and Jace, the Mind Sculptor."
