The deck also aims to generate additional value from artifacts like Prophetic Prism and Ichor Wellspring. Additionally, cards like Rally the Peasants can provide a big boost in damage to close out games quickly. The mana base includes a mix of lands that provide both colors needed for the deck and some lifegain to help stabilize against aggressive opponents."
