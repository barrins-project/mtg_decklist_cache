By utilizing powerful cards like Cryptic Command, Snapcaster Mage, and Supreme Verdict, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while generating value from its spells and creatures. The inclusion of land disruption with cards like Spreading Seas and Ghost Quarter can also help to slow down the opponent's game plan. This deck strives to outlast its opponent and win through attrition and incremental advantage."
