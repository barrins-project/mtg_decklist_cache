            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to disrupt the opponent's hand and resources while controlling the board with cards like Smallpox, Raven's Crime, and Liliana of the Veil. The win condition is to deplete the opponent's hand and life total through incremental damage with cards like The Rack and Shrieking Affliction. The deck aims to maintain card advantage and board control through a combination of discard spells, removal, and hand disruption, ultimately overwhelming the opponent and securing a victory."
