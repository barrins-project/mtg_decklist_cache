The deck aims to apply pressure early with efficient creatures like Tarmogoyf and Grim Flayer, backed up by powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil. The inclusion of cards like Siege Rhino and Lingering Souls provide additional value and life gain to outlast opponents in longer games. By combining disruption, removal, and aggressive threats, this deck aims to control the game and come out ahead."

The key concept is to use cantrips and card selection to find the necessary combo pieces while controlling the board with counterspells like Remand. Gifts Ungiven is used to search for specific cards, while Past in Flames allows the player to re-cast spells from the graveyard for additional value. The goal is to generate a large storm count to finish the game in one explosive turn."
