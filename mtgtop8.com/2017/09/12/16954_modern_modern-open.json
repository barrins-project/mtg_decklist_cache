            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and aggressive creatures, using cards like Goblin Guide, Burning-Tree Emissary, and Reckless Bushwhacker to quickly build a strong board presence. The deck also includes pump spells like Atarka's Command to deal additional damage and finish off the opponent quickly. Additionally, cards like Manamorphose and Simian Spirit Guide help generate extra mana to play multiple spells in a turn, while Narnam Renegade provides some early game disruption. The goal is to apply constant pressure and win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

Using cards like Life from the Loam and Faithless Looting, the deck is able to consistently dredge through the graveyard and maintain a steady flow of creatures. Conflagrate and Darkblast provide removal options while also synergizing with the graveyard strategy. The key idea is to manipulate the graveyard in order to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of creatures and powerful spells."

The deck also utilizes the synergy between Retreat to Coralhelm and Knight of the Reliquary to quickly assemble a lethal board state. Collected Company provides additional creature cards, allowing for explosive turns and overwhelming aggression. Thalia, Heretic Cathar disrupts opponents' plans, while Voice of Reason provides additional card advantage. This deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and aggressive game plan."
