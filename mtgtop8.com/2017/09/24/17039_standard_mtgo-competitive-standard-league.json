By utilizing low-cost creatures like Earthshaker Khenra and Ahn-Crop Crasher, as well as powerful finishers like Hazoret the Fervent and Chandra, Torch of Defiance, the deck aims to deal quick damage and control the board. The inclusion of burn spells such as Lightning Strike and Shock adds additional reach and removal options. With a streamlined focus on aggression and direct damage, this deck aims to quickly close out games before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
