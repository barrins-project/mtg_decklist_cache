Aether Vial allows you to cheat out creatures at instant speed, and cards like Tidehollow Sculler and Flickerwisp provide additional disruption and flexibility. The mana base includes utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Shambling Vent to control the battlefield. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt and overwhelm opponents with a combination of aggro and control elements."
