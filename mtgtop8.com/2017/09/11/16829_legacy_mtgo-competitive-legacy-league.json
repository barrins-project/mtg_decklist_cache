            "notes": "The key concept of this Aluren Combo deck is to utilize the Aluren enchantment to create a loop of creature combos, allowing the player to repeatedly play creatures for free and trigger their enters-the-battlefield abilities. By using cards such as Baleful Strix, Cavern Harpy, and Recruiter of the Guard, the deck can continuously generate advantage and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes disruption elements like Cabal Therapy and Abrupt Decay to control the board while setting up the combo. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with value and efficiency through its synergistic creature interactions."
