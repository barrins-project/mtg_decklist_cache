The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of direct damage and pressure, while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack. The mana base is streamlined to ensure consistent access to the necessary colors, allowing for a fast and punishing playstyle that can finish off opponents before they have a chance to stabilize."
