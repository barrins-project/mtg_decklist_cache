By equipping creatures with powerful equipment like Cranial Plating, and using Steel Overseer to further buff them, the deck aims to deal massive damage to the opponent as quickly as possible. The key strategy is to swarm the board with cheap artifacts and leverage their synergy with cards like Arcbound Ravager and Mox Opal to overwhelm the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize."

By utilizing lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident, as well as disruptive creatures like Cursecatcher and Harbinger of the Tides, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building a powerful army of Merfolk creatures. The inclusion of Aether Vial and cards like Spreading Seas allow for additional versatility and card advantage, making it a potent and efficient aggro deck in the Modern format."
