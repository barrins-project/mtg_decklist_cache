By utilizing energy-generating cards like Rogue Refiner and Servant of the Conduit, the deck can ramp into its bigger threats like Glorybringer and Skysovereign, Consul Flagship. The inclusion of removal spells like Magma Spray and Abrade helps to keep the opponent's board in check, while cards like Longtusk Cub and Bristling Hydra provide a steady stream of threats. The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain a strong board presence throughout the game."
