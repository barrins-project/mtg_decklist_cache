Additionally, Flickerwisp and Eldrazi Displacer can be used to repeatedly trigger enter the battlefield effects for added disruption. The use of Aether Vial allows for quick creature deployment and the mana denial strategy is further reinforced with cards like Ghost Quarter and Wasteland Strangler."

The manabase is designed to support the control gameplan with plenty of lands that produce blue and white mana, as well as some red sources for burn spells."

This allows the player to set up a lock with Ensnaring Bridge and disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize. The deck also has access to removal and disruption spells like Abrupt Decay and Surgical Extraction to further control the game. The deck aims to outmaneuver the opponent and grind out a win through attrition and resource denial."

The deck also includes cantrips like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to dig through the deck efficiently. This deck is focused on casting multiple spells in a turn to create a storm count that can overwhelm the opponent."

By using cards like Devoted Druid and Vizier of Remedies, the player can generate infinite mana to cast a Walking Ballista for lethal damage. The deck also includes creatures with valuable enter-the-battlefield abilities, protection, and recursion to provide consistency and versatility in its combos. Additionally, the deck utilizes mana dorks like Birds of Paradise and Noble Hierarch to ramp into its combo pieces quickly."
