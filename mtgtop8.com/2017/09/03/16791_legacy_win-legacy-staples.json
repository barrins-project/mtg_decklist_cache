By utilizing cards like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Guide, and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent while also disrupting their game plan with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze. The deck also includes card draw and filtering spells like Ponder and Brainstorm to maintain consistency and find the necessary threats and answers. Overall, the deck focuses on speed, efficiency, and disruption to quickly overwhelm the opponent."
