By sacrificing lands and searching for Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle, the player can deal a significant amount of damage to their opponent by triggering Valakut's ability multiple times. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Sweltering Suns to control the board and protect the combo. Overall, the goal is to assemble the pieces needed for a win condition through efficient ramping and card draw."

Aether Vial allows for quick creature deployment, while cards like Flickerwisp and Restoration Angel provide additional utility and disruption. The deck looks to capitalize on the opponent's difficulties in casting spells and navigating a board full of tax effects and disruptive creatures."
