The key strategy is to equip Cranial Plating onto creatures like Etched Champion or Signal Pest to deal massive damage quickly. Steel Overseer and Arcbound Ravager provide additional ways to buff up your creatures, while Galvanic Blast offers some removal and reach. The deck aims to turn the game into a race, overwhelming opponents with aggressive threats and efficient plays."
