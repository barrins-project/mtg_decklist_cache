By using cards like God-Pharaoh's Gift, Gate to the Afterlife, and Champion of Wits, you can manipulate your graveyard to bring powerful creatures back into play and generate value. Glint-Nest Crane, Trophy Mage, and Minister of Inquiries help you find the pieces you need, while Hollow One and Angel of Invention provide additional threats to pressure your opponent. Walking Ballista and Insolent Neonate offer utility and flexibility in different game situations."
