            "notes": "The deck focuses on casting cheap spells and generating mana quickly to storm off by comboing with multiple copies of Grapeshot to deal lethal damage to the opponent. It utilizes cards like Manamorphose, Pyretic Ritual, and Desperate Ritual to generate mana, while also including cards like Gifts Ungiven and Strategic Planning to dig for combo pieces. Goblin Electromancer and Baral, Chief of Compliance help reduce mana costs of spells, allowing for explosive turns. The deck aims to efficiently draw through the deck using cantrips like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand before going off with the combo finish."
