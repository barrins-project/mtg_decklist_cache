It also includes a win condition with Approach of the Second Sun, allowing the player to win the game after casting the spell twice. The deck aims to stall the opponent's threats, disrupt their game plan, and maintain a strong defensive position until it can close out the game with its win condition. The mana base is designed to consistently support the deck's control elements and ensure smooth gameplay."
