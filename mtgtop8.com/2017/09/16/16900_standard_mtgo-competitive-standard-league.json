Glint-Nest Crane and Trophy Mage help to find the necessary artifacts, while Angel of Invention and Champion of Wits provide powerful creatures to reanimate. Thought-Knot Seer and Walking Ballista offer disruption and removal options. The deck also includes land options that provide additional utility."
