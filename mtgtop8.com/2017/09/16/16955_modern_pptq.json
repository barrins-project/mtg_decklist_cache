By utilizing creatures with abilities that combo well together, such as Devoted Druid and Vizier of Remedies, the deck aims to generate infinite mana and multiple creature triggers to overwhelm the opponent. With the flexibility to adapt to different situations through creature tutoring and recursion, the deck can efficiently control the board and win through a powerful combo finish."

The deck also has some removal and card draw to help maintain momentum and deal with threats.

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly flooding the board with low-cost artifacts like Memnite, Ornithopter, and Signal Pest to support powerful artifact creatures like Arcbound Ravager and Steel Overseer. Cranial Plating allows for high damage output, while Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum help ramp up resources. The inclusion of aggressive creatures like Vault Skirge and Etched Champion, along with removal spells like Dispatch and Galvanic Blast, make it difficult for opponents to stabilize. The deck benefits from its ability to quickly build a threatening board presence and overwhelm opponents before they can react effectively."
