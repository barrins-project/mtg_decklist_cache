The inclusion of cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Rolling Earthquake also helps to control the board and protect the player from potential threats. With a focus on disruption and aggression, this Dragon Stompy deck looks to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."

By utilizing cards like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to pump up all Merfolk creatures, combined with disruptive tools like Chalice of the Void and Force of Will to control the game, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with efficient creature beatdown. The inclusion of True-Name Nemesis provides a difficult-to-answer threat, while Aether Vial allows for creatures to be deployed at instant speed for maximum flexibility in combat."
