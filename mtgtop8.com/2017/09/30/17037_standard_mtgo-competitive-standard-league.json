By using energy cards like Servant of the Conduit and Longtusk Cub, the deck can power out powerful threats like Glorybringer and Bristling Hydra. The Scarab God provides late-game value and recursion, while cards like Whirler Virtuoso and Chandra, Torch of Defiance offer additional utility and card advantage. With a mix of aggressive creatures and removal, this deck aims to apply constant pressure to opponents while controlling the board state."
