By playing low-cost creatures like Bomat Courier and Ahn-Crop Crasher, combined with burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock, the goal is to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Hazoret the Fervent serves as a powerful finisher if the game goes on longer. The inclusion of cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Kari Zev, Skyship Raider provide additional versatility and threats. Overall, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

Attune with Aether and Servant of the Conduit help ramp up mana for casting powerful threats like Glorybringer and Skysovereign, Consul Flagship. Removal spells like Magma Spray, Harnessed Lightning, and Abrade provide answers to opposing threats. The deck aims to maintain a board presence while also being able to go on the offensive with efficient creatures and burn spells. The inclusion of cards like Whirler Virtuoso and Aethersphere Harvester provide additional options for combat and energy generation."
