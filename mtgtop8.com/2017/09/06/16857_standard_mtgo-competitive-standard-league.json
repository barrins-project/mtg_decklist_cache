The deck utilizes Eldrazi Displacer for blinking effects, Selfless Spirit for protection, and Walking Ballista for additional removal. The inclusion of Thought-Knot Seer allows for hand disruption, while Archangel Avacyn provides a late-game threat. The mana base is designed to efficiently cast the Eldrazi creatures and support spells. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and control the board to secure victory."
