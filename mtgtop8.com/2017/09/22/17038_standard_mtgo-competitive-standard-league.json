The deck also focuses on mana ramping through cards like Servant of the Conduit and Attune with Aether to be able to play big threats like Verdurous Gearhulk and The Scarab God. It includes removal spells like Harnessed Lightning and Abrade to deal with opposing threats, while also providing some card advantage with Whirler Virtuoso and Rogue Refiner. The deck aims to quickly build a board presence and maintain pressure on the opponent."
