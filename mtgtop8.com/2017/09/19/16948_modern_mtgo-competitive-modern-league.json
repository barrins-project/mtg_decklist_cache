This is achieved through the use of cards like Lantern of Insight, Ghoulcaller's Bell, and Codex Shredder to control the top cards of their library, while also using cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Pithing Needle to prevent them from attacking or using their key cards. The deck also includes disruption in the form of hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, as well as removal spells like Abrupt Decay to further control the board. The deck aims to grind out the opponent by controlling their resources and making it difficult for them to execute their game plan."

By bouncing lands with cards like Simic Growth Chamber and Gruul Turf, the deck can generate a lot of mana quickly and search for powerful lands like Vesuva and Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion. The goal is to assemble the necessary lands to generate a lethal attack with Primeval Titan, often utilizing cards like Slayers' Stronghold and Radiant Fountain to give the Titan haste and extra life gain. The deck also includes some control elements like Pact of Negation and Engineered Explosives to protect the combo."

            "notes": "This Modern 1 vs 1 Eldrazi Aggro deck focuses on the efficiency and power of Eldrazi creatures to overwhelm opponents quickly. By utilizing cards like Thought-Knot Seer, Reality Smasher, and Walking Ballista, the deck aims to pressure opponents and disrupt their game plan. With support from cards like Chalice of the Void and All Is Dust, the deck can control the board while still delivering a fast and aggressive game plan. The use of Eldrazi lands like Eldrazi Temple and Urza's Mine, Power Plant, and Tower helps ramp into powerful threats early in the game."
