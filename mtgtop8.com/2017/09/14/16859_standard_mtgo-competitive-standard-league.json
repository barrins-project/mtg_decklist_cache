The deck focuses on using cards like Dispel, Fumigate, and Cast Out to control the board while also utilizing cards like Oath of Jace, Champion of Wits, and Strategic Planning to generate card advantage. The deck also aims to abuse the God-Pharaoh's Gift and Refurbish combo to bring back powerful creatures like Angel of Invention. The inclusion of key sideboard cards like Sunscourge Champion and Cataclysmic Gearhulk help to further control the game and come out ahead in the late game."
