The deck also includes removal spells like Fumigate and Cast Out to control the board and keep the opponent's threats in check. The inclusion of Linvala, the Preserver and Descend upon the Sinful provides additional ways to stabilize and gain advantage in the late game. Ultimately, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with high-powered threats while controlling the game with removal and ramp."
