The deck also includes removal spells like Unlicensed Disintegration and Walking Ballista to deal with any opposing threats. The inclusion of vehicles like Heart of Kiran and Aethersphere Harvester provides additional damage and evasion options. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently through aggressive creature plays and artifact synergies."
