By using cards like Scapeshift and Knight of the Reliquary to search for Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle, the deck can deal significant damage in a short amount of time. Additionally, cards like Boom / Bust can help disrupt the opponent's mana base while Prismatic Omen ensures all lands produce red mana for maximum efficiency. The aggro strategy of this deck focuses on overwhelming the opponent with fast, powerful landfall triggers."
