By using cards like Inquisition of Kozilek, Thoughtseize, Collective Brutality, and Smallpox, the deck aims to control the board while slowly draining the opponent's resources. Bitterblossom and Lingering Souls provide a steady stream of creatures to pressure the opponent. The deck also has planeswalkers like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Liliana of the Veil to provide additional threats and disruption. Overall, the key concept revolves around resource denial and attrition to outlast the opponent."
