The inclusion of The Scarab God adds a powerful late-game threat. The deck also features removal spells like Abrade and Magma Spray to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to maintain aggression while also having options for control and disruption."

Strategic Planning helps to filter through the deck and find key pieces, while cards like Cast Out and Fumigate provide answers to threats. This deck plays a long game, grinding out advantage until it can take over the game with its powerful threats."
