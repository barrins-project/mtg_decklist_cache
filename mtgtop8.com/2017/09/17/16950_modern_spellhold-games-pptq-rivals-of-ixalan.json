It utilizes Gifts Ungiven to search for key creatures and spells, while also taking advantage of graveyard recursion with Unburial Rites. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells and removal while setting up a powerful late-game board presence with its creatures. It also has access to card advantage and versatility through cards like Snapcaster Mage and Cryptic Command."
