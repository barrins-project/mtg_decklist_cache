By efficiently ramping up mana with cards like Azusa and Knight of the Reliquary, the deck can deploy threats early and consistently. Collected Company and Lingering Souls provide additional value and resilience, while cards like Path to Exile and Ghost Quarter disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creatures and land-based interactions."
