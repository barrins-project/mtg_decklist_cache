The key strategy is to use Through the Breach or Summoner's Pact to bring out Primeval Titan to fetch multiple lands, triggering Valakut's ability to deal damage to the opponent. Anger of the Gods and Lightning Bolt provide removal and control, while Hour of Promise can help search for Valakut or other important lands. Woodfall Primus is included for additional removal and disruption. The overall goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful combos and direct damage."
