Spellstutter Sprite provides disruption while also being a solid flyer, and Augur of Bolas helps dig for key cards. The deck aims to maintain tempo by consistently playing threats and answers, utilizing evasive creatures and burn spells to close out games quickly. The mana base is streamlined for consistency, and card draw/filtering spells help ensure a smooth curve and maximize efficiency."
