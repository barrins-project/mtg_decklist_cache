This deck focuses on quickly filling the graveyard and using cards like Faithless Looting and Cathartic Reunion to cycle through the deck, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with a steady stream of creatures and powerful spells like Conflagrate. The deck aims to win the game through a combination of graveyard recursion and aggressive creature plays."

It also utilizes efficient threats in the form of Tarmogoyf, Siege Rhino, and Grim Flayer to pressure the opponent quickly. The deck also has a strong mid-game with cards like Lingering Souls and Liliana of the Veil to grind out value and control the board. Additionally, the deck has some flexibility with cards like Abrupt Decay and Collective Brutality to deal with various threats."
