By playing efficient creatures like Nest Invader and Nettle Sentinel, along with combat tricks like Hunger of the Howlpack and Mutagenic Growth, the goal is to quickly build a threatening board presence. Cards like Rancor and Vines of Vastwood provide additional pump effects to push through damage, while Scattershot Archer helps deal with pesky flying creatures. This deck aims to win the game fast and decisively by applying constant pressure on the opponent."
