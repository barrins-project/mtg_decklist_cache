            "notes": "The primary focus of this deck is to control the game using powerful spells like Terminus, Counterbalance, and Force of Will to manipulate the board state and prevent opponents from establishing dominance. By utilizing card advantage from cards like Sensei's Divining Top and Snapcaster Mage, the deck aims to outlast opponents and secure victory through cards like Entreat the Angels and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. Through a combination of removal, counter spells, and card advantage, the deck seeks to maintain control of the game until it can win with its powerful finishers."
