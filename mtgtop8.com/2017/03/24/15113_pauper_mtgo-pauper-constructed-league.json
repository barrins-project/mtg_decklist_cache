By using cards like Chainer's Edict and Doom Blade to remove threats, as well as counterspells like Counterspell to stop key spells from resolving, the deck aims to stay ahead in the game. Archaeomancer and Ghostly Flicker provide value by recurring powerful spells, while Mulldrifter and Sea Gate Oracle help with card draw and selection. The deck also includes some graveyard recursion with Reaping the Graves. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the board and out-valuing the opponent."
