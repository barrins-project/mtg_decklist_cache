Using cards like Timberwatch Elf, Lys Alana Huntmaster, and Elvish Vanguard, along with mana dorks like Priest of Titania and Llanowar Elves, the deck aims to quickly build a formidable board presence and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Spidersilk Armor and Wellwisher provide additional support and resilience to keep the elves going strong."
