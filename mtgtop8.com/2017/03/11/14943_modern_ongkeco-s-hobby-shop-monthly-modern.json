By utilizing cards like Mutagenic Growth, Groundswell, and Become Immense, along with protection spells like Blossoming Defense and Vines of Vastwood, you can pump up your creatures and protect them while dealing poison damage. Cards like Noble Hierarch and Spellskite provide mana acceleration and disruption, while Wild Defiance can help increase the power of your spells. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm your opponent with Infect damage before they can respond effectively."
