The deck also includes disruptive elements such as Cursecatcher and Chalice of the Void to control the opponent's strategy. Along with powerful protection cards like Force of Will and Umezawa's Jitte, the deck aims to maintain control of the game while steadily attacking with its Merfolk creatures. Additionally, the inclusion of Aether Vial allows for instant creature deployment and helps to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient aggro strategy."
