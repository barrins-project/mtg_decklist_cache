The deck also includes creatures like Gifted Aetherborn and Gonti, Lord of Luxury to provide additional threats and disruption. By efficiently removing opposing threats and generating card advantage with powerful planeswalkers, the deck aims to outvalue its opponent and ultimately come out on top in the late game."
