The deck focuses on card advantage and efficient removal spells like Path to Exile and Supreme Verdict. The key win condition is to stall the game with board wipes and counterspells until eventually overwhelming the opponent with powerful planeswalkers like Gideon Jura and Jace, Architect of Thought, or finishing the game with a large Sphinx's Revelation. Additionally, the deck utilizes lands like Celestial Colonnade and Spreading Seas to control the opponent's resources effectively."
