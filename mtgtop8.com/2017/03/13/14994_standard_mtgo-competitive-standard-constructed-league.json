Cards like Grim Flayer, Winding Constrictor, and Verdurous Gearhulk allow for rapid growth of creatures, while the deck's removal spells like Fatal Push and Grasp of Darkness help clear the way for attacks. The deck also utilizes cards like Traverse the Ulvenwald and Grapple with the Past for consistency and to ensure a steady flow of threats onto the battlefield."
