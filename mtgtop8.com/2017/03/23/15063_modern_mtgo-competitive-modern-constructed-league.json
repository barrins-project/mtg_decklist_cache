The deck includes cards that allow you to lower your own life total, such as Street Wraith, to pump up Death's Shadow and other powerful creatures like Gurmag Angler. In addition to efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt, the deck also includes disruption in the form of discard spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize to control your opponent's hand. This deck aims to put your opponent on the back foot and win through quick and powerful attacks."
