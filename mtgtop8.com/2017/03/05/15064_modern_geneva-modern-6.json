The deck aims to punish opponents for playing non-creature spells with cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel, while also providing some flexibility and reach with cards like Boros Charm, Skullcrack, and Lightning Helix. By applying pressure early and maintaining a steady stream of burn spells, the deck seeks to close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
