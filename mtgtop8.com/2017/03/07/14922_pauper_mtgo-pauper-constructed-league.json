It includes a mix of removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Flame Slash, card draw with Mulldrifter and Mystical Teachings, and recursion with Mnemonic Wall. The deck also features a variety of utility cards like Expedition Map for land tutoring and Prophetic Prism for mana fixing. The goal is to control the game through a combination of removal, card advantage, and powerful late-game spells like Rolling Thunder."
