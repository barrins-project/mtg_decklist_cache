The synergy between mana acceleration cards like Chrome Mox and Ancient Tomb allow the deck to quickly establish a dominant board presence and finish the game swiftly."

The deck also utilizes creatures like True-Name Nemesis, Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, Spell Queller, Mausoleum Wanderer, and Judge's Familiar to further disrupt opponents and protect its own game plan. The mana base is built to support this control strategy with Wasteland providing land disruption and the ability to keep opponents off key resources."

The deck also includes cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder, as well as disruption like Duress and Cabal Therapy to protect the combo. Past in Flames allows for recursion of key spells, while cards like Abrupt Decay provide additional removal and utility. The deck aims to efficiently and explosively execute its combo to overwhelm opponents."
