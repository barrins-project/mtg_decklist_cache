Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan to secure a quick victory."

Primeval Titan helps to search for key lands while cards like Explore and Courser of Kruphix provide card advantage and help in ramping up to achieve the combo win condition.

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy, using Merrow Reejerey to tap down blockers and clear the way for a strong attack. Cursecatcher and Harbinger of the Tides provide additional control elements to support the aggressive game plan."
