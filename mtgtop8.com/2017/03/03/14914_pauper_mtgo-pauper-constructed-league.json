By consistently playing low-cost creatures like Faerie Miscreant and Delver of Secrets, and utilizing disruptive cards like Spellstutter Sprite and Counterspell, this deck aims to pressure the opponent while preventing them from executing their own game plan. The inclusion of Ninja of the Deep Hours provides card advantage and tempo advantage, ensuring the deck can keep up with the opponent's threats. Overall, this deck emphasizes a balance between aggression and control to secure victory."

The deck aims to quickly establish a board presence using cards like Delver of Secrets and Gurmag Angler, while also disrupting the opponent's strategies with counterspells and removal spells like Counterspell and Doom Blade. By efficiently managing resources and adapting to the opponent's plays, this deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory through a combination of aggression and control."
