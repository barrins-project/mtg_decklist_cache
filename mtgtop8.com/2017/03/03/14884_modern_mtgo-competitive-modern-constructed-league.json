This allows for explosive turns where players can overwhelm their opponent with a large number of creatures. Cards like Collected Company and Chord of Calling help to find the necessary pieces to assemble the combo and close out the game."

Control elements such as Oblivion Stone, Relic of Progenitus, and Pyroclasm help disrupt the opponent's strategy while search spells like Sylvan Scrying and Ancient Stirrings ensure consistent access to key pieces of the UrzaTron ramp engine. Overall, this deck aims to control the game early on and overwhelm opponents with its powerful late-game threats."
