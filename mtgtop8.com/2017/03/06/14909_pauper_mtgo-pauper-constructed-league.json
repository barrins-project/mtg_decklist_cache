The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while quickly closing out the game by attacking with evasive creatures. The inclusion of cards like Skred and Lightning Bolt provides additional removal options to deal with threats. The deck's consistency is supported by cantrips like Ponder and Preordain, ensuring that it can find the right cards when needed."
