The deck includes cards like Manipulate Fate to tutor for key combo pieces and Force of Will to protect the combo. Leovold, Emissary of Trest is included to disrupt opponent's strategies and provide card advantage. The deck aims to quickly assemble the combo and overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and disruptive spells."
