It includes cards that allow for efficient removal of threats from the opponent's side while also providing card advantage and disruption. The deck seeks to control the pace of the game and apply pressure early on, forcing the opponent to react to the looming threat of Death's Shadow. With a blend of aggression and control elements, the deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents in the Modern format."
