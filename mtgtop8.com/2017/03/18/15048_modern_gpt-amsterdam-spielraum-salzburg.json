It aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and burn spells, while utilizing cards like Arcbound Ravager and Inkmoth Nexus to provide additional win conditions. The inclusion of cards like Etched Champion and Vault Skirge provide resilience against removal spells, allowing the deck to maintain pressure and close out games quickly."
