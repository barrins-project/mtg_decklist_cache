By utilizing cards like Aether Vial and Collected Company, players can quickly put out multiple Merfolk creatures onto the battlefield to overwhelm their opponent. Cards like Spreading Seas and Lord of Atlantis help to boost the power of the Merfolk creatures and disrupt the opponent's mana base. The goal is to build a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure to quickly defeat the opponent. The deck focuses on tempo and synergy among the Merfolk tribe to secure victory."
