By utilizing cards like Master of the Pearl Trident and Lord of Atlantis to pump up other Merfolk creatures, as well as using Aether Vial to cheat them onto the battlefield, the deck aims to quickly establish dominance in the early game. Cards like Harbinger of the Tides and Sea's Claim are included to disrupt the opponent's strategy and protect your own creatures, while cards like Spreading Seas help to fix your mana and draw cards. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, disruptive, and efficient in its strategy."
