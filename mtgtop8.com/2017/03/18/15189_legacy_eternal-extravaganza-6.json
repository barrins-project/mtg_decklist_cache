The deck can generate advantage and create pressure by casting Entreat the Angels and utilizing Jace, the Mind Sculptor for card advantage and control. The mana base is designed to support the color requirements of the spells in the deck."

Cards like Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith help to draw through the deck quickly and find key combo pieces like Craterhoof Behemoth. Natural Order allows for quick access to powerful creatures like Craterhoof Behemoth. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Reclamation Sage and Scavenging Ooze to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and explosive combo."
