It then aims to cast Living End to bring all of those creatures back onto the battlefield, often overwhelming the opponent. The deck also includes disruption elements like Avalanche Riders and Fulminator Mage to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Beast Within and Blood Moon provide further disruption while also helping to control the opponent's board. The deck can create explosive turns and win the game quickly through its combo potential."
