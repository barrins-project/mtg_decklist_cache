The deck aims to stabilize the board and outvalue the opponent with card advantage from Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, while also having a win condition in Entreat the Angels. The mana base is optimized for fetching lands with fetchlands and having access to all three colors for flexibility in spells."
