By playing aggressively and taking advantage of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel, Goblin Guide, and Monastery Swiftspear, along with a variety of burn spells like Lava Spike and Lightning Bolt, the goal is to quickly reduce your opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize. Additionally, cards like Boros Charm and Atarka's Command provide flexibility and additional reach to close out games."
