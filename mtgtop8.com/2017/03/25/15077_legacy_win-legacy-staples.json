The deck focuses on land recursion with Life from the Loam and ways to manipulate lands with cards like Exploration and Crop Rotation. Engineered Explosives and Punishing Fire provide removal options, while Intuition and Entomb help with card advantage. The deck also has a lands combo win condition with Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage. Overall, the deck aims to control the game through efficient land management and disruption."
