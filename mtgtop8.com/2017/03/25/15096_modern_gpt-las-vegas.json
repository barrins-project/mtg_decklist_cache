It also includes cards like Skullcrack and Atarka's Command to prevent the opponent from gaining life or stabilizing, while Searing Blaze helps control the board and deal damage."

Jace's Phantasm grows stronger as the opponent's library shrinks, with cards like Manic Scribe and Mind Funeral adding to the mill strategy. Additionally, Shelldock Isle allows for powerful spells to be cast for free once enough cards have been milled."

The Eldrazi creatures like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher bring fast, aggressive pressure to overwhelm the opponent and close out the game. Additionally, cards like Eldrazi Displacer and Drowner of Hope provide additional utility and ways to disrupt the opponent's strategy."

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big, efficient threats while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Path to Exile and Eldrazi Displacer. Engineered Explosives provides additional removal options, while Ancient Stirrings helps to dig for key pieces. The deck also utilizes a mix of dual lands to ensure consistent mana fixing."
