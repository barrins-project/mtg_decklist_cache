The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while applying pressure with efficient creatures and burn spells, ultimately overwhelming the opponent and securing a quick victory. The deck focuses on tempo and efficiency, aiming to stay ahead in the game and prevent the opponent from stabilizing."
