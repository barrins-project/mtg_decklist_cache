The deck also utilizes artifact tokens generated by cards like Kuldotha Rebirth and Ichor Wellspring to maintain card advantage. Boros Garrison and Prophetic Prism help to fix mana while cards like Journey to Nowhere provide removal. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creatures, burn spells, and token generation."
