This will lock the opponent out of casting their spells effectively. The deck aims to play creatures like Hanweir Garrison, Scab-Clan Berserker, and Prophetic Flamespeaker to apply constant pressure on the opponent's life total. The deck also includes powerful artifacts like Chalice of the Void and Umezawa's Jitte to further disrupt the opponent's strategy while also enhancing the deck's aggression. Overall, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent and win the game."
