It includes mana ramping elves like Elvish Mystic and Priest of Titania to power out bigger threats like Timberwatch Elf and Lys Alana Huntmaster. With cards like Distant Melody to draw into more elves and Wirewood Pride for additional creature buffs, the deck has a strong aggro game plan that seeks to build a wide board and push through damage quickly."
