The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt, while utilizing cards like Thought Scour to enable delve cards like Tasigur, the Golden Fang. Stubborn Denial provides protection for your threats and helps maintain tempo advantage."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly building up a board presence using Eldrazi creatures and ramping into powerful threats such as Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher. Utilizing cards like Noble Hierarch and Eldritch Evolution, it aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also providing a steady stream of threats. The inclusion of cards like Path to Exile and Engineered Explosives adds disruption and removal, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive creatures and disruptive elements, ultimately leading to victory."
