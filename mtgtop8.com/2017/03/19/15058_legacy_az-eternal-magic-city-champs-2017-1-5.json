The deck also uses creatures like Deathrite Shaman and Leovold, Emissary of Trest to disrupt the opponent and gain additional value. The deck is designed to control the game while setting up the combo, and can also use Shardless Agent and Glint-Nest Crane to dig for key cards. Overall, the deck focuses on generating value and achieving a powerful board state through the Aluren combo."
