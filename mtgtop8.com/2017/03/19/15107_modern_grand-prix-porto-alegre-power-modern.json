By utilizing low-cost creatures and efficient burn spells, the deck aims to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total and finish them off before they have a chance to stabilize. With a focus on speed and early aggression, the deck looks to apply pressure from the beginning of the game and maintain that pressure throughout. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the aggressive game plan and ensure consistent access to the necessary colors of mana."

You use cheap removal spells and disruption like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to control the board and protect your Death's Shadow. Traverse the Ulvenwald helps you find specific creatures or lands you need, while cards like Temur Battle Rage and Ghor-Clan Rampager give your Death's Shadow trample and extra power. The deck aims to win quickly by overwhelming your opponent with a large, hasty creature."
