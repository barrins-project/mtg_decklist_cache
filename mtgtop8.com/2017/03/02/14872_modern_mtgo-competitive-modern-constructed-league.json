The deck aims to stabilize the board with board wipes like Supreme Verdict and Cryptic Command, control the opponent's spells with counterspells like Logic Knot and Mana Leak, and remove threats with Fatal Push and Path to Exile. Snapcaster Mage allows for additional value by flashing back key spells, while Sphinx's Revelation provides card draw and life gain. Celestial Colonnade serves as a win condition, allowing for a slow but steady victory."
