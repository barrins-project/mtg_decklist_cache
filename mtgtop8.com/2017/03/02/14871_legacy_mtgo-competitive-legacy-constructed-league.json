It also includes disruptive spells like Cabal Therapy and Duress to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own combo.

The deck runs a variety of counterspells like Force of Will and Counterspell, along with removal spells like Swords to Plowshares to handle threats. It also includes ways to manipulate the top of the library with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Sensei's Divining Top. The win condition of the deck is to either control the game until decking the opponent or to create a large army of Angels with cards like Entreat the Angels."
