Spreading Seas can disrupt opponent's mana base, while Dismember provides removal options. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm opponents with a fast and synergistic Merfolk tribal strategy."

The deck also utilizes cards like Mishra's Bauble and Street Wraith to manipulate life totals to maximize the power of Death's Shadow. The deck can also close out games quickly with cards like Temur Battle Rage and Ghor-Clan Rampager. Overall, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and keep them on the back foot while delivering the final blow."
