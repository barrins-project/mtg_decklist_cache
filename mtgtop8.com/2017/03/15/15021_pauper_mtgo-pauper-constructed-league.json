The idea is to establish early board presence and maintain pressure, utilizing cards like Skarrgan Pit-Skulk and Young Wolf to apply pressure while also having resilience with Safehold Elite and River Boa. The inclusion of cards like Viridian Longbow and Scattershot Archer offers removal options to deal with opposing threats. The mana base is primarily Forests to ensure consistent early game plays."
