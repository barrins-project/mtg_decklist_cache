The deck runs plenty of cantrips and mana ramp cards like Lotus Bloom and Pentad Prism to facilitate this combo and win as early as turn three. The inclusion of Phyrexian Unlife helps to prevent you from losing the game due to life loss from Ad Nauseam. Pact of Negation allows you to protect your combo from disruption while Spoils of the Vault can fetch key pieces from your deck."

This mana can then be used to cast powerful threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Wurmcoil Engine, and control cards like Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The deck also runs cards like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to search for the Urza lands efficiently, and has removal options like Fatal Push and Collective Brutality to deal with opposing threats."
