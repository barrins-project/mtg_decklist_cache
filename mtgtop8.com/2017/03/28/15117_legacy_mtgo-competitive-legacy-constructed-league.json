Cards like Price of Progress and Eidolon of the Great Revel punish opponents for playing non-basic lands or casting spells, respectively. The deck prioritizes speed and consistency to close out games before the opponent can stabilize."

The deck also includes disruption elements like Duress and Cabal Therapy to protect the combo.
