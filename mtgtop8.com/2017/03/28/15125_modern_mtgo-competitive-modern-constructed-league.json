The deck also includes cards like Oblivion Stone, Firespout, and Relic of Progenitus to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and overpower the opponent with large threats."

Traverse the Ulvenwald helps you find Death's Shadow or other key cards, while Mishra's Bauble provides card selection. The deck aims to be aggressive and efficient in order to win quickly."
