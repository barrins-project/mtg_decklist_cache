The deck also includes a couple of backup win conditions like Walking Ballista and Engineered Explosives, as well as Pact of Negation for protection."

The deck aims to quickly reduce its own life total to make Death's Shadow a powerful threat on the board. Efficient removal spells and counterspells help protect Death's Shadow and other creatures, while also controlling the opponent's board. The deck's synergy between its cards allows it to apply aggressive pressure while staying protected, creating a strong and competitive aggressive strategy in the Modern 1 vs 1 format."
