The deck aims to quickly deal damage, control the board with counter spells, and finish off the opponent with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning. The deck also utilizes card draw and manipulation to ensure consistent plays and maximize efficiency. It thrives on fast-paced gameplay and punishes slow setups with its direct damage spells and tempo plays."

This enables the player to cast powerful spells such as Natural Order to bring out Craterhoof Behemoth, which can then give all the creatures a massive power boost and potentially win the game in a single turn. The deck focuses on generating mana efficiently and chaining together multiple card draw effects to overwhelm the opponent with its fast and explosive combos."
