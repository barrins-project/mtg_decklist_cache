The deck aims to apply pressure early on with aggressive creatures like Tarmogoyf and Death's Shadow, while also having the ability to disrupt the opponent's game plan with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek. The deck is designed to be a fast and proactive aggressive deck that can quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

By doing so, you can trigger abilities that bring them back to the battlefield, creating a constant stream of creatures to overwhelm your opponent. Additionally, cards like Life from the Loam and Conflagrate give you the flexibility to control the board and deal damage to your opponent. Overall, this deck aims to generate a powerful synergy between graveyard recursion and creature aggression."
