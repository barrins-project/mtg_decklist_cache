The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells and removal, while also utilizing card draw and card selection to set up powerful plays. By combining aggressive creatures with a midrange game plan, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with tempo advantage and efficient use of resources."
