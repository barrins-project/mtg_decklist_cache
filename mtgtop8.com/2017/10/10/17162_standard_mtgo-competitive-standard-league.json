            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly overwhelm your opponent with fast, aggressive creatures and burn spells. By playing efficient creatures like Hazoret the Fervent, Earthshaker Khenra, and Ahn-Crop Crasher, along with burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock, you can deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Soul-Scar Mage and Rampaging Ferocidon help to further pressure your opponent and disrupt their game plan. Overall, the goal of this deck is to deal damage as quickly as possible and close out the game before your opponent has a chance to stabilize."
