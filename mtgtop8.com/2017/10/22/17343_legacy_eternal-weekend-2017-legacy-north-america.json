By combining quick threats like Delver of Secrets and Nimble Mongoose with powerful counterspells like Force of Will and Stifle, the deck aims to control the game and dictate the pace. With a low land count and focus on tempo, the deck is built to maintain pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan. It relies on a mix of efficient creatures, counter magic, and burn spells to close out games swiftly."
