The deck aims to control the game through milling and disruption, while also having some removal options to deal with threats. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize its consistency in executing its game plan."

By utilizing cards like Karn Liberated, Reality Smasher, and Thought-Knot Seer, along with mana acceleration from Eldrazi Temple and Urza's lands, this deck aims to overpower opponents with large threats early in the game. Additionally, cards like Chalice of the Void and Relic of Progenitus help disrupt opponent's game plans, while Expedition Map and other utility lands provide consistency and flexibility."
