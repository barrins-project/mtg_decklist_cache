By efficiently ramping up mana with creatures like Noble Hierarch and Birds of Paradise, this deck can quickly deploy threats like Knight of the Reliquary and Courser of Kruphix. Collected Company allows for explosive plays by putting creatures directly into play, while cards like Tireless Tracker and Scavenging Ooze provide additional value and disruption. The deck's flexibility and synergy make it a strong choice for aggressive strategies in Modern 1 vs 1."

The deck utilizes hand disruption spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also using removal spells like Path to Exile, Fatal Push, and Abrupt Decay to deal with threats on the board. The deck then closes out the game with powerful creatures like Siege Rhino, Tarmogoyf, and Tasigur, the Golden Fang. The deck aims to control the game early and finish with powerful threats in the mid to late game."
