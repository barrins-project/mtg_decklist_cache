The deck includes pump spells like Groundswell, Might of Old Krosa, and Mutagenic Growth to increase the power of the infect creatures and finish the game in just a few turns. The deck also includes protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense to protect the infect creatures from removal spells and ensure the opponent's defeat."
