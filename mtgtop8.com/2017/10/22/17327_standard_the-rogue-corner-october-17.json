The deck aims to stall the game until it can play Approach of the Second Sun for a win condition. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Gideon of the Trials and Chandra, Torch of Defiance for additional control and card advantage. Additionally, Sunbird's Invocation can generate card advantage and Oketra the True can create a board presence."
