The deck also utilizes mana acceleration with Urza lands and ramp spells like Expedition Map to cast its threats ahead of schedule. With Chalice of the Void and Karn Liberated, the deck aims to control the board and limit the opponent's options. Overall, the strategy focuses on applying pressure and maintaining board presence to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory."

Supporting cards like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Oblivion Stone provide further control and removal options.
