Leovold, Emissary of Trest provides card advantage and disruption. The mana base is designed to support a variety of colors for optimal flexibility in using all the spells in the deck."

The deck also utilizes mana acceleration through cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Ancient Tomb to play its high-cost creatures ahead of schedule. Cards like Chalice of the Void and Umezawa's Jitte help control the game and protect the Eldrazi from removal spells. Utilizing lands like Eye of Ugin and Eldrazi Temple, this deck aims to quickly establish a threatening board presence and close out the game before the opponent can respond."
