The deck also includes disruption elements like Chalice of the Void and Surgical Extraction to control the opponent's game plan. Endbringer provides card advantage and board control, while Karn Liberated and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger offer powerful finishers. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and powerful spells while maintaining a strong board presence."

Utilizing cards like Street Wraith, Thoughtseize, and Snapcaster Mage to control the opponent's resources and disrupt their game plan. Additionally, the deck includes powerful removal options like Fatal Push and Terminate to handle opposing threats. This aggressive strategy is further supported by card draw and selection with Serum Visions, Opt, and Thought Scour to maintain momentum and close out games quickly."
