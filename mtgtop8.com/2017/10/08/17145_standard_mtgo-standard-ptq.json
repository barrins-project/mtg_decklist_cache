The key strategy is to ramp up with mana dorks like Servant of the Conduit and Attune with Aether, allowing for fast plays and explosive starts. Creatures like Whirler Virtuoso and Rogue Refiner provide value and generate energy, which can be used to power up Bristling Hydra and other abilities. Finishers like Glorybringer and Longtusk Cub help close out games quickly by attacking relentlessly and overwhelming the opponent."
