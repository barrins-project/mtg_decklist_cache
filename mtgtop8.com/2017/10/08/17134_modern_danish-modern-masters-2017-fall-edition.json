The deck also includes utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Sanctum of Ugin, along with card draw and filtering options to ensure consistency in executing its game plan."

The deck also utilizes planeswalkers like Sorin, Lord of Innistrad, Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, and Elspeth, Knight-Errant to generate value and close out the game.

The deck also has a combo finish with Felidar Guardian and Saheeli Rai, allowing for infinite copies of the Guardian. The inclusion of cards like Snapcaster Mage and Cryptic Command provide flexibility and card advantage. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win conditions, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with strong threats and efficient interaction."
