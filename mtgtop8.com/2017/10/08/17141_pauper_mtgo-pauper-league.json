Counterspells like Counterspell and Daze are used to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while card draw spells such as Ponder and Preordain help to find key pieces. The goal is to tempo out the opponent with efficient plays and keep the pressure on with flying creatures, ultimately leading to victory through a combination of control and aggression."
