Quirion Ranger and Nettle Sentinel provide additional mana acceleration and flexibility, while Burning-Tree Emissary allows for explosive starts by casting multiple spells in a single turn. By maintaining a fast pace and applying constant pressure, this deck aims to defeat the opponent before they can mount a strong defense."

By playing efficient threats like Young Wolf and Skarrgan Pit-Skulk, and using pump spells like Rancor and Hunger of the Howlpack, the deck aims to apply pressure and win the game as quickly as possible. With a low mana curve and the ability to deploy multiple threats in a single turn, this deck seeks to establish a dominant board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
