            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by using efficient creatures and powerful instant spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan. By combining creatures like Geist of Saint Traft and Spell Queller with counterspells like Cryptic Command and Logic Knot, the deck aims to maintain board presence while denying the opponent's threats. The deck also includes burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lightning Helix for removal and additional reach. Celestial Colonnade provides a resilient win condition, allowing the deck to close out games once the opponent's resources are depleted."
