Protection spells like Apostle's Blessing and Daze help keep your creatures safe while spells like Temur Battle Rage and Mutagenic Growth can provide a surprising burst of damage. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and efficient spells, making it a potent Aggro deck in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
