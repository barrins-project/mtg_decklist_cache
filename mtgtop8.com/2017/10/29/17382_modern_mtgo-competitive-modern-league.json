By utilizing fast mana sources and low-cost spells, the deck aims to pressure the opponent early and prevent them from stabilizing. With a combination of direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, along with creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck can close out games quickly before the opponent has a chance to establish their game plan. Additionally, cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel add extra punishment for opponents playing non-creature spells."
