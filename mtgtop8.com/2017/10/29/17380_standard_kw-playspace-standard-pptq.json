With a low mana curve and plenty of burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock, the deck can quickly reduce the opponent's life total while maintaining a strong board presence. Hazoret the Fervent provides a powerful late-game threat, and cards like Bomat Courier and Consuming Fervor help maintain card advantage and push for the win. The deck's key strategy is to apply constant pressure and finish the game before opponents can stabilize."
