            "notes": "This deck focuses on controlling the game with counterspells and removal spells while also applying pressure with efficient threats. The mana base is streamlined to consistently cast spells on curve, with the inclusion of Celestial Colonnade for a powerful late-game threat. Card advantage is generated through Snapcaster Mage and Serum Visions, allowing the deck to outvalue opponents in the long game. Geist of Saint Traft and Spell Queller provide strong and evasive threats, while Nimble Obstructionist can disrupt opposing strategies. Overall, the deck aims to outlast opponents through a combination of control and midrange strategies."
