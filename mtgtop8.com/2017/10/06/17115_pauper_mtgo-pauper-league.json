By utilizing bounce effects and card draw engines like Gush and Ninja of the Deep Hours, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent while keeping a steady stream of resources flowing. The inclusion of Faerie Miscreant and Spellstutter Sprite adds additional versatility and synergy to the deck's game plan, making it a powerful and adaptable midrange option in the Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
