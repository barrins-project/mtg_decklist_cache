Aether Vial allows for quick deployment of creatures, while disruptive cards like Daze and Force of Will help control the board. The deck also has some utility with cards like Swords to Plowshares and Harmonic Sliver. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's color requirements and maximize efficiency."

It also heavily relies on cards like Price of Progress and Eidolon of the Great Revel to punish opponents for playing nonbasic lands and casting spells. The deck aims to overwhelm and outpace the opponent's defenses by consistently attacking and burning them down until victory is achieved."
