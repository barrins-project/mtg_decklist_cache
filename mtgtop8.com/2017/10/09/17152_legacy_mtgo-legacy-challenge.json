This deck utilizes a combination of efficient creatures and disruptive spells to control the game and close out matches quickly before the opponent can recover. The deck's mana base is optimized to support the powerful Eldrazi cards and ensure consistency in casting them early in the game."

By discarding cards like Phantasmagorian and Street Wraith, the deck can trigger the abilities of cards like Ichorid, Narcomoeba, and Prized Amalgam to generate a swarm of creatures on the battlefield. With cards like Dread Return and Cabal Therapy, the deck is able to quickly bring out powerful creatures like Flayer of the Hatebound and win the game by overwhelming the opponent with an aggressive graveyard-based strategy."

Natural Order can also be used to tutor for specific combo pieces to further strengthen the board state."

The deck also utilizes powerful cantrips like Ponder and Brainstorm to dig for threats and disruption, with Force of Will providing backup protection. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive strategy, with Wasteland helping to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Ultimately, this deck aims to close out games quickly while disrupting the opponent's game plan."

It also includes disruption in the form of Cabal Therapy and Force of Will to control the opponent's game plan. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements while also having access to key lands for consistency. Overall, the goal is to create a fast and efficient combo deck that can overwhelm opponents with big threats early in the game."
