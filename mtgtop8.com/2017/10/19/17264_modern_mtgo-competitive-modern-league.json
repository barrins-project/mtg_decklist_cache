            "notes": "This Selesnya Aggro deck focuses on quickly and aggressively building up a board presence using efficient creatures. The key concept is to ramp up mana quickly with cards like Birds of Paradise and Noble Hierarch, allowing for early plays and bigger threats. The deck also prioritizes disruption with cards like Aven Mindcensor and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, hindering the opponent's game plan. Furthermore, the deck utilizes the synergy between Collected Company and creatures with enter the battlefield effects like Eternal Witness and Tireless Tracker, providing card advantage and board advantage. The land base includes utility lands like Gavony Township and Ghost Quarter for additional advantage."
