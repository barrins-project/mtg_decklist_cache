The deck also aims to generate card advantage and pressure with creatures like Dark Confidant, Deathrite Shaman, and Lingering Souls. Additionally, the deck uses equipment like Batterskull, Sword of Fire and Ice, and Umezawa's Jitte to further enhance its creatures' effectiveness in combat. The mana base includes disruptive lands like Wasteland and utility lands like Karakas and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth."
