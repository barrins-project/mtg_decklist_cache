Control elements are also included with counterspells like Essence Scatter and removal spells like Abrade and Magma Spray. The mana base is built to support the multicolored cards in the deck, allowing for consistent and efficient casting of spells."

By utilizing cards like Disallow, Fatal Push, and Vraska's Contempt, this deck aims to neutralize threats from the opponent. The inclusion of The Scarab God and Torrential Gearhulk provides additional late-game power and recursion. Search for Azcanta and Hieroglyphic Illumination help dig for key cards, while Field of Ruin offers disruption for opponent's utilities. With a balanced mix of control elements and threats, this deck aims to outlast and outvalue the opponent."
