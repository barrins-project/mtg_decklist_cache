By using card advantage and disruption, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and gradually take over the game. The inclusion of flicker effects like Ghostly Flicker enhances the deck's synergy and allows for powerful plays with cards like Mulldrifter. The mana base is designed to support the control strategy by providing a stable mana base with bounce lands and utility lands."
