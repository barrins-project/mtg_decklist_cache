The deck aims to ramp up mana quickly with cards like Sakura-Tribe Elder and Search for Tomorrow to eventually combo off with Scapeshift and Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle, dealing massive damage to the opponent. Bring to Light adds flexibility in finding necessary cards, while Snapcaster Mage provides versatility in reusing spells from the graveyard."
