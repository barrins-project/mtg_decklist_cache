The deck also includes burn spells like Shock, Lightning Strike, and Abrade to clear the way for attacks. The addition of Harsh Mentor punishes opponents for using activated abilities, and Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides additional card advantage and removal. The deck aims to close out games quickly by applying constant pressure and finishing off opponents with burn spells or direct damage from Ramunap Ruins and Sunscorched Desert."

It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of tokens, supported by cards like Start / Finish for removal and The Scarab God for recursion. Sacred Cat and Anointer Priest help to provide early defense and life gain, while cards like Fatal Push and Fumigate offer control options. Overall, the deck's strategy revolves around aggressive token generation and board presence."
