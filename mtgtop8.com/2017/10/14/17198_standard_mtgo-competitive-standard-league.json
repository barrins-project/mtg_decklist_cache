            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly swarm the board with low-cost creatures and use cards like Cartouche of Solidarity and Trial of Solidarity to pump them up and give them evasion. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and efficient creatures, supported by powerful planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Hazoret the Fervent. The deck also features cards like Bomat Courier and Scrapheap Scrounger for card advantage and resilience. With a mix of creatures and spells, this aggressive deck aims to close out games quickly through relentless pressure."
