The deck aims to maintain card advantage through cards like Mulldrifter and Archaeomancer while keeping the opponent on the back foot with cards like Chainer's Edict and Disfigure. The deck also has some recursion with cards like Ghostly Flicker and Reaping the Graves, allowing for repeated use of key spells. Additionally, the deck has a strong card selection engine with Preordain and Sea Gate Oracle."
