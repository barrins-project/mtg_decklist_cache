By using cards like Serum Visions and Thoughtseize to set up the board and disrupt opponents, combined with quick removal like Fatal Push and Terminate, it aims to control the game early on. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Gurmag Angler and Liliana of the Veil to help maintain pressure and provide additional control. The strategy revolves around efficiently playing threats, disrupting the opponent, and quickly closing out the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
