The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with counterspells like Metallic Rebuke and removal spells like Fatal Push, while also generating card advantage with cards like Tezzeret the Schemer and Prophetic Prism. The deck can also generate a board presence with artifact creatures like Maverick Thopterist and Herald of Anguish, while also having a powerful finisher in The Scarab God. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game tempo and outvaluing the opponent."

Hostage Taker provides additional control elements, while cards like Ipnu Rivulet and Walking Ballista offer extra utility and damage potential.
