To enable this, the deck focuses on searching for key pieces like Gate to the Afterlife and utilizing cards like Champion of Wits and Hostage Taker to manipulate the graveyard. By utilizing cards that provide card advantage and disruption, the deck aims to out-value the opponent and overwhelm them with powerful resurrected creatures. Additionally, the deck utilizes a mix of creatures and spells to provide flexibility and adaptability in different situations."
