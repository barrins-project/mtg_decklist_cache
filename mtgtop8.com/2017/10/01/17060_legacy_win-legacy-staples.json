The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to control the board. In addition, the deck has access to strong removal spells like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay to deal with threats. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color identity, with access to both disruption and card advantage through Leovold, Emissary of Trest and Ancestral Vision."
