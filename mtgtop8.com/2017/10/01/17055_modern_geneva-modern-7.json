The deck also includes ways to tutor for specific cards and maintain its lock on the game."

It seeks to outvalue opponents with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Spell Queller while maintaining card advantage with Cryptic Command and Serum Visions. By disrupting the opponent's game plan and applying pressure with efficient threats, the deck aims to establish dominance in the mid to late game. Additionally, the deck utilizes a mana base that allows for flexibility in casting spells of different colors."
