It utilizes a combination of low-cost artifacts, evasion creatures, and pump spells to create a fast and aggressive game plan. By utilizing cards like Arcbound Ravager and Cranial Plating, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently, while also having some resilience with cards like Etched Champion and Vault Skirge. The key strategy is to swarm the board with artifacts and use them to fuel powerful attacks."
