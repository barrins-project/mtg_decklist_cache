The deck also includes removal and graveyard hate cards to help control the game until the combo can be assembled. The goal is to assemble the key pieces of the combo as quickly as possible to overwhelm the opponent."

            "notes": "The main strategy of this deck is to quickly ramp up mana using cards like Farseek and Explore, while also controlling the board with cards like Lightning Bolt and Sweltering Suns. The ultimate goal is to use Scapeshift to search for Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and multiple Mountains to deal large amounts of damage to the opponent. Primeval Titan can also be used to search for Valakut and additional lands to trigger its ability. The deck focuses on efficiently ramping up mana and assembling the Valakut combo for a powerful win condition."
