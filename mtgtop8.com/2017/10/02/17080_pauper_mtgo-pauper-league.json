By maximizing the synergies between creatures with hexproof or protection and powerful aura cards, the deck aims to quickly build up a large board presence and deal a significant amount of damage before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. By carefully balancing aggression and resilience, the deck seeks to maintain pressure on the opponent while avoiding being easily disrupted."
