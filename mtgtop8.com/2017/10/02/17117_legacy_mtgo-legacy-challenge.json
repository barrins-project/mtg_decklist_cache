The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor to maintain board advantage and stabilize the game. Monastery Mentor provides additional threats while Snapcaster Mage allows for spell recursion. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent access to the necessary spells."

This mana is then used to cast powerful creatures like Craterhoof Behemoth and Ruric Thar, the Unbowed, or to search for them with cards like Green Sun's Zenith. The deck also includes cards like Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger to untap creatures and get extra value out of them, while also utilizing Glimpse of Nature to draw additional cards and keep the combo going."
