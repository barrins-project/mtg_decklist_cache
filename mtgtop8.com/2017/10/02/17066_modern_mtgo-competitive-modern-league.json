The toolbox of creatures provides flexibility and answers to various situations, while aggressive creatures like Kitchen Finks and Rhonas the Indomitable help close out the game quickly. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its combo potential and versatility."

The planeswalkers, Jace, Architect of Thought and Gideon Jura, provide additional support and protection for the control strategy. Overall, the deck looks to stall the game until it can establish a dominant position and win through incremental advantage."
