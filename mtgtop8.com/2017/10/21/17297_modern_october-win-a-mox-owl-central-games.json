The deck also includes various ways to search for the UrzaTron lands, disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Collective Brutality and Oblivion Stone, and gain card advantage with cards like Sylvan Scrying and Ancient Stirrings.

It utilizes cards like Cryptic Command, Path to Exile, and Supreme Verdict to handle threats effectively. It also includes card draw and selection spells like Serum Visions and Think Twice to maintain card advantage. The deck's win condition is to either out-resource the opponent or to protect powerful planeswalkers like Gideon Jura and Jace, Architect of Thought until they can take over the game. Lastly, the deck utilizes land disruption with cards like Ghost Quarter and Spreading Seas to further control the game."
