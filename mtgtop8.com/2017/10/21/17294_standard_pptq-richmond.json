            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to maintain control over the game by utilizing counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to disrupt the opponent's plans. The deck focuses on using cards like Disallow, Essence Scatter, Fatal Push, and Vraska's Contempt to deal with threats on the board, while also utilizing cards like Glimmer of Genius and Search for Azcanta to generate card advantage and filter through the deck. The win condition of the deck comes from powerful creatures like The Scarab God and Torrential Gearhulk, which can take over the game once control has been established."
