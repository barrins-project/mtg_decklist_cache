By utilizing cards like Birds of Paradise and Noble Hierarch to ramp, along with Chord of Calling and Collected Company to find key creatures, the deck aims to quickly assemble a combo involving Devoted Druid and Vizier of Remedies to generate infinite mana. This infinite mana can then be used to pump Walking Ballista for the win or to gain infinite life with Kitchen Finks. The deck also includes utility creatures like Eternal Witness and Qasali Pridemage to provide flexibility and resilience."
