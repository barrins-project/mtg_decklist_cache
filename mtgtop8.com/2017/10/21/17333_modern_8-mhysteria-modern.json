It prioritizes early board presence and continuous pressure, punishing opponents for playing non-creature spells with cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack. The deck utilizes a low mana curve and a mix of direct damage and creature removal to maintain tempo and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. It aims to win through aggressive combat damage and burn spells rather than relying on late-game strategies."
