By applying early pressure and disrupting the opponent?s resources, the deck aims to outvalue and outpace the opponent in a Modern 1 vs 1 matchup."

Its key strategy revolves around locking down the opponent's options with cards like Chalice of the Void and Ensnaring Bridge, while generating value through artifact recursion with cards like Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek. It also includes disruption with removal spells like Fatal Push and counters with cards like Lodestone Golem. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent in a long game, utilizing Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas to generate card advantage and win conditions."
