            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly ramp up mana using ramp spells like Sakura-Tribe Elder and Farseek, and eventually play Scapeshift to sacrifice lands and fetch multiple Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle triggers to deal massive damage to the opponent. Primeval Titan can also be used to fetch Valakut or additional lands to set up the combo. The inclusion of Prismatic Omen ensures that all lands are considered Mountains for Valakut triggers, while Hour of Promise can help find Valakut or create additional land triggers. Relic of Progenitus also helps disrupt graveyard strategies."
