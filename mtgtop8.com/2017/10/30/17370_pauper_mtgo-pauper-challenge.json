The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures that are difficult to deal with due to their hexproof ability and high power/toughness from enchantments like Ethereal Armor and Ancestral Mask. The mana base is designed to ensure smooth gameplay and consistent mana availability for casting both creatures and auras. The deck aims to win the game quickly by dealing large amounts of damage each turn."
