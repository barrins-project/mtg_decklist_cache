The deck also includes a toolbox of creatures like Eternal Witness and Kitchen Finks, which can be searched for and put into play using Chord of Calling and Collected Company. The mana dorks like Birds of Paradise and Noble Hierarch help ramp up to the combo quickly, while cards like Duskwatch Recruiter provide card advantage and consistency. The deck aims to disrupt opponents with its versatile creatures while setting up the combo win condition."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and slowly grind out a victory through card advantage and efficient removal. It also includes a win condition in the form of a planeswalker such as Gideon Jura or Jace, Architect of Thought, while also providing alternate win conditions through man lands like Celestial Colonnade. The mana base is designed to support the control elements of the deck and ensure consistent access to all colors of mana."
