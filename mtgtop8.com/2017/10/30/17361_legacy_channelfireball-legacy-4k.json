By using cards like Duress, Cabal Therapy, and Gitaxian Probe to disrupt the opponent's hand, the deck aims to assemble a critical mass of spells to cast Tendrils of Agony and win the game in a single turn. The main win condition is to generate a high storm count and cast Tendrils of Agony, dealing lethal damage to the opponent."
