The ultimate goal is to assemble enough spells in a single turn to cast Grapeshot multiple times, dealing lethal damage to the opponent in one explosive turn. The deck thrives on efficiency, card selection, and explosive combo potential."

Through the Breach and Scapeshift can also be used to quickly bring out powerful creatures or to quickly assemble the combo for a win. Anger of the Gods helps with board control while Search for Tomorrow and Hour of Promise ensure consistent ramping."
