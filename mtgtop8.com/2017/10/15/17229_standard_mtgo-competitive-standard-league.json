The deck features cards that generate tokens, such as Anointer Priest and Legion's Landing, as well as cards that benefit from having a wide board presence, like Anointed Procession and Crested Sunmare. Additionally, there are interaction cards like Fatal Push and Start/Finish to deal with opposing threats. The deck aims to go wide and go fast, utilizing the aggro strategy to pressure the opponent and secure a quick victory."
