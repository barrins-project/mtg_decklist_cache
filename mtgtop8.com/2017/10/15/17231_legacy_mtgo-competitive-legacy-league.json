The ultimate goal is to find combo pieces such as Craterhoof Behemoth or Natural Order to deliver a lethal blow to the opponent. The deck also includes disruption in the form of cards like Deathrite Shaman and Reclamation Sage to interact with the opponent's strategy and protect its own combo. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of Elves and finish them off with a powerful combo."
