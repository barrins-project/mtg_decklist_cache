By utilizing efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, along with direct damage spells like Lava Spike and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Price of Progress punish opponents for playing non-basic lands, while Fireblast can be used as a powerful finisher. Overall, the deck's strategy revolves around pushing its aggressive game plan to secure a fast victory."
