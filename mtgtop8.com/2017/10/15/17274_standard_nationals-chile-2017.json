By utilizing cards like Hidden Stockpile, Anointed Procession, and Legion's Landing, players can quickly generate a large board presence. The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Fumigate to control the board and keep the opponent in check. The endgame is dominated by powerful finishers like The Scarab God, providing a way to close out the game once the token army has done its job. The deck aims to be fast and aggressive, overwhelming the opponent before they can mount a defense."
