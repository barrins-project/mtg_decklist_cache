Steel Overseer and Arcbound Ravager are key cards in boosting the power of the creatures, while Mox Opal allows for quick mana acceleration. The inclusion of Pia's Revolution adds a recursion element to the deck, forcing the opponent to take damage or sacrifice their own creatures when they destroy your artifacts. This aggressive strategy aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
