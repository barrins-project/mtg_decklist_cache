The combo potential of Felidar Guardian and Saheeli Rai is also utilized to create infinite copies of the Guardian and generate advantage. The deck also includes various energy-producing cards and strong control elements like Disallow and Baral's Expertise to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The goal is to quickly ramp up energy, control the board, and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
