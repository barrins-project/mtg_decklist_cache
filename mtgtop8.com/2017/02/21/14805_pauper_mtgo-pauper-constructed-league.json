The deck utilizes control spells like Counterspell, Condescend, and Diabolic Edict to stall the opponent and protect the combo pieces. Mulldrifter and Mnemonic Wall provide card advantage while cards like Pulse of Murasa and Lone Missionary help with survivability. The deck also includes a variety of removal spells and card draw options to control the board and outvalue the opponent."
