The deck also includes burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Dismember to finish off opponents quickly. The mana base is based on a Grixis color combination to provide flexibility in playing cards of various colors."

The deck utilizes a variety of cantrips and card filtering effects to dig for specific answers and threats, while also being able to reset the board with Terminus when needed. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional card advantage and win condition potential."
