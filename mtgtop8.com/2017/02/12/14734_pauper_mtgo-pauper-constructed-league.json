Cards like Gush and Gitaxian Probe are included to help draw into more threats and fuel the aggressive game plan. Dispel and Apostle's Blessing provide protection for our creatures, while Lightning Bolt serves as an efficient removal spell. The mana base is designed to support the deck's low curve and tempo-oriented strategy."

By utilizing creatures with strong abilities like Quirion Ranger and Nettle Sentinel, the deck can maintain a fast tempo and pressure opponents early on. Cards like Rancor and Vines of Vastwood provide additional boosts to creatures, while cards like Vault Skirge and River Boa offer evasion and resilience. The deck's strategy is to outpace opponents and quickly deplete their life total before they can stabilize or mount a defense."
