By utilizing cards like Walking Ballista and Verdurous Gearhulk to pump up creatures like Glint-Sleeve Siphoner and Longtusk Cub, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on. With removal spells like Fatal Push and Grasp of Darkness to clear the way, and additional energy generation from Aether Hub and Attune with Aether, this deck is designed to apply constant pressure and outpace the opponent in a fast-paced aggressive strategy."
