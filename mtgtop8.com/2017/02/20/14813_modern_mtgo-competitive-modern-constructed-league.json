            "notes": "The deck focuses on assembling a strong board presence of Elf creatures quickly and efficiently using cards like Heritage Druid and Collected Company. By generating a lot of mana and utilizing creature synergies, the deck can generate overwhelming advantage and win the game with a sudden burst of damage, often led by Ezuri, Renegade Leader. The inclusion of cards like Chord of Calling and Dwynen's Elite allows for flexibility and further combo potential, making the strategy versatile and adaptable to different situations."
