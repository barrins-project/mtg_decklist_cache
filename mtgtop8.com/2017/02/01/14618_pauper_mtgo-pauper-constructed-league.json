Ninja of the Deep Hours enables card advantage, while Spire Golem provides a solid defender. Ponder and Preordain help with deck manipulation, while cards like Daze and Deprive offer additional disruption. Gush and Logic Knot provide flexibility in mana efficiency and graveyard interaction. Vapor Snag acts as removal, and Bonesplitter boosts creature damage output. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure while controlling the opponent's resources."
