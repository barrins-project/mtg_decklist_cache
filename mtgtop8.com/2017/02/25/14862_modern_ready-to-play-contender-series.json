With a combination of cheap creatures like Tarmogoyf and high-impact spells like Thoughtseize and Liliana of the Veil, the deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent early on and maintain that pressure throughout the game. The deck also includes cards like Mishra's Bauble and Traverse the Ulvenwald to provide card selection and consistency in finding key pieces."
