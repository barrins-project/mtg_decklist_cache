The deck also includes win conditions in the form of Nahiri, the Harbinger and Torrential Gearhulk. The inclusion of a mix of removal spells, counterspells, and card draw allows the player to respond to a variety of threats and outvalue the opponent in the long run. Additionally, the mana base is carefully constructed to ensure smooth mana curve and consistent access to all colors needed for spells."
