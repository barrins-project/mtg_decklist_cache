By utilizing cards like Mulldrifter for card advantage, Chainer's Edict for removal, and Counterspell for countering opponent's spells, the deck aims to outlast opponents and win the game through attrition. The inclusion of Mystical Teachings allows the player to search for specific answers when needed, while cards like Pristine Talisman help with mana ramp and life gain. The deck excels at disrupting opponent's strategies and grinding out victories in a long game."

By continually applying pressure with low-cost spells and creatures with abilities that deal damage, the deck aims to reduce the opponent's life total to zero as quickly as possible. The use of cards like Chain Lightning, Fireblast, and Lightning Bolt are key in maintaining a fast pace and overwhelming the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
