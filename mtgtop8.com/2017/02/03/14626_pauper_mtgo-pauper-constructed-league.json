Control elements are included to disrupt opponents and maintain board control, while card draw and recursion provide consistency and options. The deck includes removal spells and card advantage engines to handle threats and outvalue opponents. The goal is to establish a dominant board state with powerful spells such as Rolling Thunder and Capsize, overwhelming opponents with efficient and versatile plays."
