This allows for explosive plays and unexpected threats early in the game. The deck also includes cards like Cathartic Reunion and Faithless Looting to help with card selection and filling up the graveyard, along with combo pieces like Nourishing Shoal and Worldspine Wurm for additional synergy. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and deadly combination of creatures."
