            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly building a board presence with efficient creatures like Glint-Sleeve Siphoner, Longtusk Cub, and Walking Ballista, supported by cards like Rishkar, Peema Renegade and Verdurous Gearhulk. The key mechanic of the deck is using +1/+1 counters to enhance the power and toughness of creatures, with Winding Constrictor and cards like Attune with Aether and Aether Hub helping to generate additional energy. Fatal Push and Grasp of Darkness provide removal options, while Aethersphere Harvester offers some evasion and lifegain. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with early aggression and efficient creature synergies."
