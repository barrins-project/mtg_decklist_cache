With powerful threats like Inferno Titan and Stormbreath Dragon, along with resilient creatures like Thragtusk and Obstinate Baloth, the deck aims to control the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its big creatures and finish them off with burn spells like Bonfire of the Damned. The deck's key strength lies in its ability to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building up to powerful late-game threats."
