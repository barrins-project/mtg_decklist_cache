The combination of cheap spells like Tarfire, Thoughtseize, and Inquisition of Kozilek, along with powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Death's Shadow, allows the deck to apply pressure early and close out games before the opponent can stabilize. The deck also has a strong graveyard synergy with cards like Mishra's Bauble and Traverse the Ulvenwald to enable Death's Shadow and Tarmogoyf to grow larger."

The deck's reliance on artifacts makes it susceptible to artifact removal, but its speed and aggressive strategy can overwhelm opponents before they have a chance to respond. The key to success with this deck is efficiently equipping creatures and maximizing damage output."

The deck also includes a toolbox of removal spells, such as Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay, to handle threats on the board. Additionally, the deck features a strong creature base with Tarmogoyf and Street Wraith, along with Liliana of the Veil for added control. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and finish the game swiftly with powerful creatures."
