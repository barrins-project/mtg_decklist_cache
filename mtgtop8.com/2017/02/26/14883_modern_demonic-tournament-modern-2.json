By casting spells like Collected Company and Lead the Stampede, the player can draw more Elves and combo pieces to overwhelm the opponent. Key cards like Ezuri, Renegade Leader and Shaman of the Pack provide ways to pump up the team and drain the opponent's life total. The deck aims to be fast and aggressive, utilizing the strength of the Elves tribe to win the game quickly."
