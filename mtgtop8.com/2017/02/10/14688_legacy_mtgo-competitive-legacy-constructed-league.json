It also includes disruptive spells like Thoughtseize, Force of Will, and Abrupt Decay to control the game and protect your own threats. The mana base is streamlined to support all the colors needed for the deck, with Wasteland for land disruption. The planeswalkers Liliana of the Veil and Jace, the Mind Sculptor provide additional control and card advantage, making this deck a versatile and powerful midrange option."
