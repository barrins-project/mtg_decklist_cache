Cards like Skarrgan Pit-Skulk and Vault Skirge provide evasion and resilience, while Quirion Ranger and Nettle Sentinel allow for extra mana acceleration and flexibility in activating abilities. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a relentless assault of creatures and combat tricks, while maintaining card advantage and tempo to secure a swift victory."
