By constantly recurring lands with cards like Life from the Loam and Crucible of Worlds, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's mana base and lock them out of the game. The deck also has the potential to create a powerful combo with Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage to quickly generate a powerful 20/20 Indestructible creature. Ultimately, the goal is to control the board and outvalue the opponent with land synergies."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively control the game through disruption spells like Hymn to Tourach and Force of Will, while also applying pressure with efficient threats like Delver of Secrets and Tarmogoyf. The deck also utilizes cards like Brainstorm and Ponder to manipulate draws and ensure consistency. Additionally, the inclusion of disruptive creatures like Deathrite Shaman and True-Name Nemesis helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base is designed to support both the black and blue heavy spells in the deck, with Wasteland providing additional disruption against opposing non-basic lands."
