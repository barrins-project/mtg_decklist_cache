It includes a mix of card draw, removal, counterspells, and burn spells to control the game and outvalue the opponent. The deck also includes recursion with cards like Pulse of Murasa and Mnemonic Wall to reuse key spells and maintain advantage. The win condition of the deck is typically casting big X spells like Rolling Thunder or overwhelming the opponent with card advantage from Mulldrifter and Compulsive Research."
