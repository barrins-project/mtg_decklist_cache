It aims to slow down the opponent's game plan and eventually outvalue them with card draw spells like Sphinx's Revelation. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency in casting spells and activating Celestial Colonnade for a win condition. Overall, the deck is built around disrupting the opponent's strategy and maintaining control of the game until victory is achieved."
