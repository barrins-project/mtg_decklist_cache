Cards like Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger provide additional utility and flexibility, while Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith help to maintain card advantage and tutor key pieces. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of Elf creatures and finish the game quickly before the opponent has time to respond effectively."
