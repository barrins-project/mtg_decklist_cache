By utilizing disruptive creatures like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Phyrexian Revoker, along with powerful equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice and Umezawa's Jitte, the deck aims to control the board and apply pressure to the opponent. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, while cards like Recruiter of the Guard and Stoneforge Mystic provide additional consistency and flexibility. Mana denial with cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port further adds to the deck's disruptive strategy."
