It uses efficient combat tricks like Rancor, Vines of Vastwood, and Mutagenic Growth to pump up creatures and push damage through. The key strategy is to establish early board presence with resilient creatures like Young Wolf and Nettle Sentinel, while using Quirion Ranger to generate extra mana and maintain tempo. The deck also includes some disruption with cards like River Boa and Viridian Longbow to handle opposing threats. Overall, the deck aims to win by quickly applying pressure and outpacing the opponent."

In addition, there are versatile removal spells like Flame Slash and Lightning Bolt to deal with threats. The deck aims to outvalue opponents and maintain control until it can establish a dominant board presence and win the game."

It also includes card draw and recursion to maintain card advantage and flexibility in handling different situations. The inclusion of counterspells and a variety of utility spells allows for adaptability in responding to opponent's plays. The end game plan is to establish board control and overwhelm the opponent with powerful spells like Rolling Thunder. Overall, the deck aims to outlast opponents through resource management and efficient decision-making."
