The deck focuses on playing aggressive threats like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer early on to pressure the opponent, while also having options for removal and disruption with cards like Dismember and Warping Wail. The inclusion of key Eldrazi like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Endbringer provides late-game power to seal the victory. Overall, the deck aims to dominate the board and close out games quickly."
