The key strategy is to cheat big creatures like Griselbrand, Elesh Norn, and Iona into play early, overwhelming the opponent with threats before they can react. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy to protect the combo and provide additional card advantage. With careful planning and efficient use of resources, the deck aims to win the game through explosive and game-changing plays."

Additionally, the deck includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to deal with opposing threats and protect its own creatures. The mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility, with access to both aggressive and disruptive spells."
