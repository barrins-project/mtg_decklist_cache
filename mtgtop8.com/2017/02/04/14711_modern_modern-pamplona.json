            "notes": "This deck aims to control the game by assembling the UrzaTron lands to generate large amounts of mana. It uses various spells like Fatal Push, Collective Brutality, and Oblivion Stone to control the board while searching for powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine, Ulamog, and Emrakul. Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon provide additional control and win conditions. The deck has a strong late-game plan with its high-impact threats and overwhelming mana advantage, making it a versatile and powerful control archetype in the Modern format."
