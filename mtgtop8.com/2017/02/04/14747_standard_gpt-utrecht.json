            "notes": "The main concept of the Golgari Aggro deck is to overwhelm the opponent with creatures that have powerful abilities, such as Winding Constrictor and Verdurous Gearhulk, while also utilizing cards like Fatal Push and Walking Ballista to control the board. The deck aims to generate +1/+1 counters and take advantage of cards that benefit from having multiple creatures on the battlefield, creating a fast-paced aggressive strategy. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Rishkar, Peema Renegade and Maulfist Revolutionary to further boost the power of the creatures and maintain a strong board presence."
