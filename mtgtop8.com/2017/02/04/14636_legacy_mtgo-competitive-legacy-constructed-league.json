It leverages powerful tribal synergies and protection from counterspells and board wipes to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures, such as True-Name Nemesis and Lord of Atlantis. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, while tempo plays like using Daze and Wasteland disrupt the opponent's mana base."
