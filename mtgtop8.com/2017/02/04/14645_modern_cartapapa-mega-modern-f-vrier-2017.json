Blood Moon is used to disrupt opponents' mana bases, while Relic of Progenitus provides graveyard hate. The inclusion of Eternal Scourge allows for recurring threats, and cards like Mind Stone and Scrying Sheets help with card draw and consistency. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue opponents with powerful late-game threats while keeping their own board state under control."
