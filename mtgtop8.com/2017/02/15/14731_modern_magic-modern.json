Additionally, cards like Scavenging Ooze and Thrun, the Last Troll provide resilience and staying power against control decks or removal-heavy strategies."

The strategy focuses on utilizing lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to pump up the team, along with Aether Vial for swarm potential. Spreading Seas helps with mana disruption while also drawing cards, and Master of Waves provides a big board presence. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive merfolk tribal strategy."
