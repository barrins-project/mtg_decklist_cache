Conflagrate can be used as a finisher, dealing damage to the opponent while also fueling the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to be a fast and efficient combo deck that can quickly dominate the game."

Primeval Titan can search for Valakut or other utility lands, providing further value. The deck's game plan revolves around ramping up quickly and efficiently to set up the combo finish."
