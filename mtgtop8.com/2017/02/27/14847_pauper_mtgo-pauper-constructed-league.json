With removal spells like Firebolt and Flame Slash, as well as finishers like Rolling Thunder and Ulamog's Crusher, the deck can maintain board control and eventually win the game. The deck also includes some protection with cards like Sea Gate Oracle and Condescend to counter opponent's threats."

It aims to play low-cost creatures such as Atog, Frogmite, and Myr Enforcer to quickly build a board presence, while also gaining card advantage with Thoughtcast. Galvanic Blast and Fling provide direct damage options to finish off the opponent. The inclusion of artifact lands and mana-fixing artifacts allows for efficient mana production to consistently cast threats. Overall, the deck's strength lies in its aggressive approach and ability to quickly build a threatening board state."
