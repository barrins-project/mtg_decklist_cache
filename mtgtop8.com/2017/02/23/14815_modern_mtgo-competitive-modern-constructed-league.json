The deck also utilizes disruptive tools like Chalice of the Void and Warping Wail to control the board and prevent opponent's plays. Overall, the goal is to maintain pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

            "notes": "This Bant Aggro deck focuses on efficiently deploying creatures and disrupting opponents with counterspells and removal spells. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of aggressive creatures like Knight of the Reliquary and Tireless Tracker, while also providing protection with cards like Spell Queller and Selfless Spirit. The inclusion of cards like Collected Company and Retreat to Coralhelm allows for additional card advantage and tempo plays. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's diverse color requirements and provide utility with lands like Ghost Quarter and Gavony Township."
