The goal is to establish a strong board presence early on and pressure the opponent with aggressive creatures. Cards like Glory-Bound Initiate and Hanweir Militia Captain can become powerful threats if left unanswered. The inclusion of cards like Bygone Bishop and Thalia's Lancers provide additional value and flexibility. Additionally, Oketra's Monument helps generate additional creatures while Cast Out and Skysovereign, Consul Flagship provide removal options. The deck looks to end the game swiftly with a strong attack force."
