            "notes": "The main focus of this Eldrazi Aggro deck is to quickly ramp up to play powerful Eldrazi creatures such as Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher. By utilizing cards like Cavern of Souls and Eldrazi Temple, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with large, difficult-to-deal-with threats. With the addition of disruptive cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Containment Priest, the deck can slow down the opponent's game plan while pushing its own aggressive strategy. The inclusion of equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Batterskull provides additional ways to increase the deck's threat level and stay ahead in the game."
