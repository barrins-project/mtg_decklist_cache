By utilizing cards that can generate mana or draw cards, the deck aims to consistently cast powerful threats like Metalwork Colossus and Elder Deep-Fiend. The Improvise mechanic allows for cheaper casting costs of spells by tapping artifacts, making it easier to deploy multiple threats in a single turn. The deck also includes a variety of artifact synergy cards to further support its strategy. With a mix of removal, card draw, and powerful threats, this deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents."
