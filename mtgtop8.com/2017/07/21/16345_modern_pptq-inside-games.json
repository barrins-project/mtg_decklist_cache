It also utilizes control elements like Condescend, Remand, and Chalice of the Void to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck includes utility cards like Expedition Map and Fabricate to search for key pieces and Academy Ruins to recycle important artifacts. Ultimately, the goal is to control the game while ramping into powerful threats for a dominant late-game."
