By filling the graveyard with self-mill cards like Grapple with the Past and Champion of Wits, the player can easily cast powerful creatures like Elder Deep-Fiend and Prized Amalgam early in the game. Kozilek's Return provides board wipes when needed, while Traverse the Ulvenwald helps search for key cards. The deck combines speed and control elements to overwhelm opponents with its aggressive strategy."
