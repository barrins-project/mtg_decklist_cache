By using cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategies and remove key cards from their hand. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Lingering Souls and Bitterblossom to generate a swarm of tokens, while also using Sorin, Solemn Visitor, Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, and Liliana of the Veil to control the board. The deck also utilizes Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth to ensure the opponent is affected by the land destruction caused by Smallpox."

The deck utilizes a mix of efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile, along with versatile instant-speed interaction in Cryptic Command and Electrolyze. The inclusion of Ancestral Vision provides card advantage and helps the deck grind out longer games. The manabase is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and enable Celestial Colonnade as a win condition."

Karn Liberated serves as a versatile threat and additional disruption. The deck also utilizes utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Sea Gate Wreckage to further disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big, efficient threats and disrupt their strategies to secure a victory."
