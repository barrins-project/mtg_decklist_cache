The deck also includes cards like Galvanic Blast for direct damage and protection cards like Welding Jar. The strategy is to use the synergy between artifacts and cards like Arcbound Ravager to create a fast and aggressive playstyle that can quickly close out the game before the opponent has a chance to respond effectively."

The inclusion of cards like Path to Exile and Blessed Alliance provide some interaction and removal options, while the mana base ensures consistency in casting the deck's powerful threats."
