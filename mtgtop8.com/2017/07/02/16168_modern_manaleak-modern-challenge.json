The goal is to generate advantage through the graveyard, enabling explosive plays and overwhelming the opponent with a flurry of creatures. The deck seeks to exploit the graveyard as a resource, making use of powerful synergies to create a fast and resilient game plan that can be difficult for opponents to disrupt."

By utilizing efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember, along with disruption like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, it aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining pressure. The deck also includes versatile cards like Snapcaster Mage and Kolaghan's Command to generate card advantage and provide additional flexibility in dealing with various threats."
