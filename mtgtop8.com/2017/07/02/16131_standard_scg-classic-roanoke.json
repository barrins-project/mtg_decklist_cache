It aims to out-value the opponent by generating card advantage and eventually winning the game with Torrential Gearhulk or Westvale Abbey. Blessed Alliance provides additional removal and life gain, while Anticipate helps in finding key cards. The deck focuses on stabilizing the board and gaining control of the game."

The deck also utilizes cards like Cast Out for additional removal and Traverse the Ulvenwald to tutor for specific cards when needed.
