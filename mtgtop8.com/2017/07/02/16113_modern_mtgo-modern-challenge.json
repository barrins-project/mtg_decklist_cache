The key strategy is to abuse the graveyard mechanics to bring back multiple creatures at once and overwhelm the opponent. Cards like Life from the Loam and Conflagrate allow for constant dredging and dealing damage to the opponent's creatures or life total. The deck is designed to set up explosive turns where multiple creatures are brought back into play, creating a powerful combo that can quickly win the game."
