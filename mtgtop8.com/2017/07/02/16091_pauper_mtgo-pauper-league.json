The deck also focuses on recurring key creatures and spells by using cards like Snap and Mnemonic Wall, allowing for a continuous stream of resources. Ephemerate is another key mechanic that is utilized to gain value from creatures with enter-the-battlefield abilities. The deck's mana base is carefully crafted to ensure consistency in casting spells and maintaining control of the game."
