The deck also includes cards like Vampire Hexmage and Sylvan Safekeeper to protect the combo from removal spells. The deck aims to win the game quickly with the powerful Marit Lage token before the opponent has a chance to respond."

The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to control the board and finish the opponent off with creatures like True-Name Nemesis and Tombstalker. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements while also having a land destruction plan with Wasteland."
