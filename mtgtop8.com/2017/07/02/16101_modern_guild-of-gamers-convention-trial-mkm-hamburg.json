Cards like Snapcaster Mage and Gurmag Angler provide additional threats and card advantage, while Stubborn Denial offers protection for the player's key spells. The overall strategy is to be aggressive and efficient in order to overwhelm the opponent and secure a victory."

This ramp allows the player to cast powerful spells like Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, which can control the board and dominate the game. The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Collective Brutality to deal with threats, as well as threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to close out the game. Overall, the deck aims to control the game with powerful spells and overwhelming mana advantage."
