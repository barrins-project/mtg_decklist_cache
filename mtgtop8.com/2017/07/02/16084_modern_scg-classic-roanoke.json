By using cards like Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play, along with lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to pump up the team, the deck aims to attack early and often. Spreading Seas disrupts the opponent's mana base while also drawing cards, and Harbinger of the Tides can provide tempo swings by bouncing problematic creatures. The deck aims to establish board presence quickly and maintain pressure throughout the game."

This allows the player to cast powerful threat cards like Wurmcoil Engine, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, and World Breaker. The deck also includes control elements such as Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Oblivion Stone to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The goal is to control the game until the player can overwhelm their opponent with their powerful threats."

The deck also includes cards like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to tutor for specific lands, ensuring consistent access to Tron.

It aims to stabilize the game with efficient removal spells like Path to Exile and Lightning Bolt, while also generating card advantage with cards like Cryptic Command and Snapcaster Mage. The win condition of the deck is often through a strong finisher like Celestial Colonnade or a large Sphinx's Revelation to gain card advantage and life. The deck excels at controlling the flow of the game and out-valuing the opponent through efficient spells and strong finishers."
