            "notes": "This Merfolk deck focuses on flooding the board with powerful creatures that buff each other, making them difficult to deal with for the opponent. By using cards like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to boost the other Merfolk creatures, and utilizing Aether Vial to cheat them onto the battlefield quickly, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of speed and synergy. With disruptive elements like Cursecatcher and Harbinger of the Tides, as well as card draw from Silvergill Adept, this deck can apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game."

Cards like Relic of Progenitus are included to disrupt the opponent's graveyard strategies, while Lightning Bolt provides additional removal and direct damage. The deck also includes Prismatic Omen to ensure all lands count as Mountains for Valakut's triggered ability."
