            "notes": "This deck focuses on casting multiple spells in a single turn to generate a large storm count, which is used to finish the opponent off with a lethal Grapeshot. It utilizes cards like Manamorphose, Pyretic Ritual, and Desperate Ritual to generate mana, while also digging through the deck with Sleight of Hand and Serum Visions. Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer help reduce the cost of spells, making it easier to chain together the necessary combo pieces. Gifts Ungiven is used to tutor for key cards like Past in Flames to help recur spells from the graveyard."
