The deck also focuses on maximizing value from cards like Thraben Inspector, Kor Skyfisher, and Glint Hawk by bouncing them back to hand and replaying them. Additionally, the deck includes token generation with Kuldotha Rebirth and Battle Screech, as well as card draw and mana fixing with Prophetic Prism and Ichor Wellspring."
