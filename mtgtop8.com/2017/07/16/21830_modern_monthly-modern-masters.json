Additionally, cards like Staff of Domination, Spike Feeder, and Archangel of Thune are included to combo off and gain massive life and/or power. The deck also includes various utility cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Beast Within to control the game state."

The goal is to quickly reduce your own life total to empower Death's Shadow while controlling the opponent's board through disruption and removal spells. The deck also utilizes delve creatures like Tasigur and Tombstalker to apply pressure. The inclusion of Snapcaster Mage allows for versatility and recursion of spells. Overall, the deck aims to be proactive and disruptive, taking advantage of the opponent's vulnerabilities to secure victory."
