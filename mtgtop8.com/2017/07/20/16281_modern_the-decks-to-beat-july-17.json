The deck's strength lies in its ability to chain spells together efficiently to create a high storm count and overwhelm the opponent."

The deck aims to ramp up its mana quickly with cards like Farseek and Search for Tomorrow, while controlling the board with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods. The inclusion of Prismatic Omen ensures that all lands count as Mountains, maximizing the effectiveness of Valakut's ability. The deck also includes some card draw and graveyard hate to improve consistency and disrupt opposing strategies."
