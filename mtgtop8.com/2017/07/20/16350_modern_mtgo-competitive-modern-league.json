The deck utilizes creatures like Arbor Elf and Burning-Tree Emissary to help generate mana, while also including powerful cards like Primeval Titan and Craterhoof Behemoth to finish off the opponent quickly. The inclusion of Eternal Witness allows for recursion of important spells, making the deck resilient against removal. Garruk Wildspeaker provides additional ramp and token generation to further support the combo strategy."
