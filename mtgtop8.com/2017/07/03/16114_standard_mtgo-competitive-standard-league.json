By utilizing cards like Scrapheap Scrounger and Toolcraft Exemplar, along with powerful threats like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Archangel Avacyn, the deck looks to quickly overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes disruption with cards like Fatal Push and Unlicensed Disintegration to clear the way for its aggressive creatures. The goal is to maintain board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
