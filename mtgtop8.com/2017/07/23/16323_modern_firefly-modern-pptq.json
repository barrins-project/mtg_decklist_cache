Once enough lands are in play, the deck aims to cast a Scapeshift spell to sacrifice the lands and deal lethal damage to the opponent with Valakut triggers. Primeval Titan and Wood Elves help to search for and put more lands into play, while Courser of Kruphix provides card advantage and Chandra, Torch of Defiance offers additional burn and ramp options."

It aims to control the board with removal spells like Terminate and Lightning Bolt while also growing Tarmogoyf and Scavenging Ooze for a quick win. Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and card advantage. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and make use of utility lands like Raging Ravine. Overall, the deck seeks to apply pressure early and maintain control throughout the game."
