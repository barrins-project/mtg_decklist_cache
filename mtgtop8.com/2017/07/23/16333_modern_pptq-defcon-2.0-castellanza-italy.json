It also utilizes spells like Atarka's Command and Lightning Bolt to deal additional damage and control the board. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of high-powered creatures, direct damage, and efficient mana usage."

By playing multiple lands per turn and using cards like Scapeshift, the deck aims to deal lethal damage to the opponent by triggering Valakut's ability to deal 3 damage for every Mountain entering the battlefield. The deck also includes cards like Lightning Bolt for removal and Relic of Progenitus for graveyard hate to disrupt opposing strategies."
