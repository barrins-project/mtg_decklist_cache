By combining efficient artifact creatures like Signal Pest and Vault Skirge with powerful equipment like Cranial Plating and Steel Overseer's ability to buff your team, this deck aims to deal a large amount of damage and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The versatility of being able to win through combat damage or with direct burn spells like Galvanic Blast adds another layer of threat for the opponent to deal with."

Removal spells like Lightning Bolt, Abrupt Decay, and Terminate help to deal with threats, while cards like Grim Lavamancer and Raging Ravine provide additional reach and damage potential.

It uses cantrips like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to dig for the combo pieces, along with mana acceleration like Lotus Bloom and Pentad Prism to cast Ad Nauseam as quickly as possible. Protection is provided by Pact of Negation and Phyrexian Unlife, with the win condition being either Laboratory Maniac or Lightning Storm. The deck aims to win the game in one explosive turn, utilizing its resources efficiently for maximum impact."
