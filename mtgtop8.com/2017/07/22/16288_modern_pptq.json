It aims to out-value the opponent by providing card advantage through cards like Snapcaster Mage and Spell Queller while maintaining a strong board presence with cards like Celestial Colonnade. The mana base allows for flexibility in casting both blue and white spells efficiently. The deck is designed to control the pace of the game and outmaneuver the opponent with precise plays and calculated decisions."
