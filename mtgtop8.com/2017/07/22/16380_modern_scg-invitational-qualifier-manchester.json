Once Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle is in play with enough Mountains, using Scapeshift will deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent, usually resulting in a game-winning play. The deck also includes cards like Prismatic Omen to ensure all lands count as Mountains for Valakut's ability, making the combo even more potent. Overall, the deck aims to assemble its combo pieces quickly and efficiently to overwhelm the opponent."
