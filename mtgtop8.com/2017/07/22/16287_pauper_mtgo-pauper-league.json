By utilizing cards like Thoughtcast to draw additional cards and Galvanic Blast to deal direct damage, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy. With a focus on artifact synergy, the deck looks to leverage the inherent advantage of Affinity cards in order to quickly build a formidable board presence and close out the game."
