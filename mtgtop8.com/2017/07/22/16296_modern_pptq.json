Overall, the deck aims to stall the game until it can establish control and win through incremental advantage."

It also includes control elements like Cryptic Command and Remand to disrupt the opponent's strategy. With the help of Howling Mine and Geier Reach Sanitarium, the deck aims to draw into its combo pieces quickly while also utilizing Gigadrowse and Exhaustion to stall the opponent. Snapcaster Mage provides additional value by flashing back important spells, making the deck a formidable force in a Modern 1 vs 1 setting."
