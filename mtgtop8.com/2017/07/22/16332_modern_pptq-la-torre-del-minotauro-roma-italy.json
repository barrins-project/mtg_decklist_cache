Snapcaster Mage provides flexibility by casting spells from the graveyard, allowing for additional removal or disruption.

It includes powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant to apply pressure and close out the game quickly. The inclusion of graveyard hate like Nihil Spellbomb and Scavenging Ooze helps to deal with opponent's strategies that rely on the graveyard. The deck also has cards like Liliana of the Veil and Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet to generate value and maintain card advantage. The goal is to apply early pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan to secure a victory."
