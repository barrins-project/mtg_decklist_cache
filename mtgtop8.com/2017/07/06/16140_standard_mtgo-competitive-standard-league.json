It also aims to control the board with Spell Queller and Fairgrounds Warden. The addition of Dusk / Dawn allows for mass removal or card advantage depending on the situation. The deck can quickly apply pressure on the opponent with Hanweir Militia Captain and Archangel Avacyn while having protection with Selfless Spirit. Overall, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggro creatures and control elements."
