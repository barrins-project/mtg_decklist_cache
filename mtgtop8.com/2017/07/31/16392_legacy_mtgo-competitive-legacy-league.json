The deck also includes disruption spells like Cabal Therapy, Thoughtseize, and Brainstorm to control the game and protect its combo. The deck aims to be able to either win with the big creatures quickly or disrupt the opponent's strategy long enough to secure a victory. The deck sacrifices consistency for the potential to win the game in explosive fashion."
