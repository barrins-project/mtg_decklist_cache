It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures backed up by removal spells like Galvanic Blast. With a mixture of cheap artifacts and efficient creatures, the deck can quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Additionally, the inclusion of lands like Blinkmoth Nexus and Inkmoth Nexus gives the deck versatility in terms of attacking both on the ground and in the air."
