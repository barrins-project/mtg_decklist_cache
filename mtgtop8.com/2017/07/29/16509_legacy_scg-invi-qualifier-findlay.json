Once the graveyard is set up, the deck can bring back powerful creatures like Ashen Rider and Flame-Kin Zealot with Dread Return, overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of creatures from the graveyard. The deck relies on quickly cycling through the library and graveyard to assemble the combo and win the game."

It aims to create a strong board presence with equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte attached to creatures fetched by Stoneforge Mystic. The combo of Splinter Twin and creatures like Pestermite can provide a win condition if needed. The deck also includes card advantage with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Snapcaster Mage, along with powerful planeswalker Jace, the Mind Sculptor."
