It also utilizes cards like Pithing Needle and Surgical Extraction to further disrupt their strategy. The deck has a solid mana base with cards like Mox Opal and Ancient Stirrings to quickly find the necessary pieces. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to deny the opponent resources and control the game through disruption and manipulation of their deck."
