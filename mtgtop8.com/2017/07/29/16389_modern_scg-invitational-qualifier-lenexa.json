This infinite mana can then be used in combination with Ezuri, Renegade Leader to pump all elves on the battlefield and swing for lethal damage in a single turn. The deck aims to win quickly and decisively through this combo while also having access to powerful toolbox cards like Chord of Calling and Collected Company."

This allows the player to bring back artifacts from the graveyard, creating a loop that can eventually lead to a win condition with Ghirapur Aether Grid or Pia's Revolution. The deck also includes ways to tutor for key pieces and to protect the combo with cards like Engineered Explosives."

The deck includes disruptive elements like Chalice of the Void and Anger of the Gods to control the board and buy time to assemble the combo. The deck also has some card advantage and removal options with Chandra, Torch of Defiance. Ultimately, the goal is to deal lethal damage to the opponent with Valakut triggers."
