            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by utilizing Urza's lands to generate a large amount of mana, allowing for powerful plays such as casting Dinrova Horror to bounce opponent's permanents and Mulldrifter for card advantage. The deck also includes various counterspells and removal spells to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, there are recursion spells like Mnemonic Wall and Pulse of Murasa to retrieve key cards from the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through efficient control tactics and resource management."
