Once Valakut is on the battlefield, the deck aims to cast Scapeshift to sacrifice lands and deal massive damage to the opponent with Valakut triggers. The deck also includes Primeval Titan to search for lands and strengthen the Valakut combo. Other cards like Hour of Promise and Wood Elves help with ramp and fixing mana, creating a powerful and explosive combo deck centered around Valakut's ability to deal damage when mountains enter the battlefield."
