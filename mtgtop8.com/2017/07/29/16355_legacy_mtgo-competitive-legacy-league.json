Removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt help control the board while threats like Gurmag Angler and Tasigur, the Golden Fang provide a win condition for the deck. The mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility."

This can be achieved through fast mana acceleration with cards like Dark Ritual and Lotus Petal, as well as using Entomb and Reanimate to bring out key combo pieces like Griselbrand. The deck also includes ways to protect the combo, such as Unmask and Shallow Grave, while Collective Brutality can help disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to win the game through a powerful, game-ending combo as quickly as possible."
