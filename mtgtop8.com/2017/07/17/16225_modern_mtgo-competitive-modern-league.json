The deck also includes cards to control the opponent's graveyard and to find key pieces of the combo. Primeval Titan is used to search for Valakut or additional lands, while Lightning Bolt provides additional removal and Reach. The deck aims to win quickly by assembling the combo and dealing lethal damage in one turn."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to disrupt the opponent's game plan by taxing their resources and slowing down their plays while maintaining pressure through aggressive creatures. By combining disruptive elements such as Leonin Arbiter, Thalia, and Spell Queller with aggressive threats like Flickerwisp and Smuggler's Copter, the deck aims to control the tempo of the game and create advantageous board states. The inclusion of cards like Venser, Shaper Savant and Eldrazi Displacer adds flexibility and additional disruption to further disrupt the opponent's strategy."
