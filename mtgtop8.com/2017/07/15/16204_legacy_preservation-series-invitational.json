The deck also utilizes powerful interaction spells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect its threats and disrupt opponents' game plans. By combining tempo plays, card selection with Brainstorm and Ponder, and a solid mana base with Wasteland and dual lands, the deck aims to quickly pressure opponents and close out games before they can stabilize."
