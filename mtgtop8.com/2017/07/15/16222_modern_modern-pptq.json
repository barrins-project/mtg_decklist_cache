            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to ramp up mana quickly using cards like Sakura-Tribe Elder and Farseek, and then use Scapeshift to find and play Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle along with enough Mountains to deal a huge amount of damage at once. Primeval Titan can also search for Valakut and Mountains, providing additional power to the combo. The deck also includes some removal in Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods, as well as some creature support with Pia and Kiran Nalaar."
