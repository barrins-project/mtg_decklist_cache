This mana is used to play cards like Gifts Ungiven and Manamorphose to dig through the deck and find the win condition cards like Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens. The goal is to create a large storm count and burn the opponent with a flurry of spells in a single turn, overwhelming them before they can respond."
