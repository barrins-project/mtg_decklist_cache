The key concept is to establish a strong board presence early on with creatures like Earthshaker Khenra and Hanweir Garrison, while also disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Thought-Knot Seer and Abrade. The deck includes burn spells like Magma Spray and Harnessed Lightning to deal with threats, with additional direct damage from cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Ramunap Ruins. The goal is to maintain pressure and close out the game with efficient creature attacks and burn spells."
