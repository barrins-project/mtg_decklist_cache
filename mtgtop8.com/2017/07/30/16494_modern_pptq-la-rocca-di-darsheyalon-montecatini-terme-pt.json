The deck includes cards like Primeval Titan and Search for Tomorrow to help ramp up lands, while cards like Farseek and Wood Elves help to search for specific lands. Anger of the Gods is included to clear the board of opposing creatures, allowing for a clear path to victory through the combo of Valakut and Scapeshift."
