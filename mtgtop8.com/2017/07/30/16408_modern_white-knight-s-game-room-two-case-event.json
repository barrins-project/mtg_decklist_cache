The deck also utilizes disruptive elements like Blood Moon and Chalice of the Void to keep opponents off balance. Emrakul, the Aeons Torn serves as a win condition, while cards like Lightning Helix provide both removal and life gain. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while building up its own powerful board presence."
