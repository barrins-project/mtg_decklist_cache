The deck also includes disruption in the form of Chalice of the Void and removal spells like Dismember to control the board. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its aggressive creatures while also having the ability to disrupt their game plan with cards like All Is Dust and Karn Liberated. With a mix of ramp, disruption, and powerful threats, this deck aims to quickly close out games in the Modern format."

With cards like Steel Overseer and Signal Pest adding extra power and utility, this deck aims to swarm the battlefield and deal large amounts of damage in a short amount of time. The key strategy is to keep up the pressure and force your opponent to react before they can stabilize."
