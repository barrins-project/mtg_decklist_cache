The deck also includes cards like Deathrite Shaman and Dark Confidant for additional value and card advantage. The goal is to efficiently and effectively combo off before the opponent can respond."

The Eldrazi creatures, particularly Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer, provide both pressure and disruption to overwhelm the opponent while cards like Umezawa's Jitte and Batterskull provide additional tools for combat. The deck aims to quickly close out the game while disrupting the opponent's strategy."

The deck includes ways to protect the combo pieces with cards like Sylvan Safekeeper and Pithing Needle, while also containing disruption and hand control elements with Duress and Thoughtseize. The deck's main goal is to assemble the combo as quickly as possible to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory. It also includes various mana acceleration cards like Lotus Petal and Elvish Spirit Guide to help achieve this goal."
