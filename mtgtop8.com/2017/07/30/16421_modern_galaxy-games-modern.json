The deck also includes disruption and removal spells to control the opponent's board while pressuring them with powerful creatures. Stubborn Denial is used as a way to protect your threats and ensure they can deal massive amounts of damage quickly. The goal is to win the game before the opponent can stabilize and mount a defense."
