The deck aims to apply pressure quickly with aggressive creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Hazoret the Fervent, while also controlling the board with Ensnaring Bridge. Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides extra card advantage and removal, while Fiery Confluence is a versatile spell for dealing damage or wiping the board. Trinisphere helps to slow down the opponent's spells, allowing this deck to gain a tempo advantage."

The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Dismember to deal with threats. By using cards like Brainstorm and Ponder to dig for more threats and disruption, the deck aims to close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's color requirements effectively."

The deck includes a mix of removal spells such as Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay, as well as countermagic in the form of Force of Will. The deck also includes hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach to further disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and win through incremental advantage."

The strategy aims to disrupt the opponent's mana base with Wasteland and Rishadan Port while also maintaining a defensive board with cards like Maze of Ith and Glacial Chasm. Punishing Fire serves as a removal option and the deck's win condition is typically assembling the Dark Depths + Thespian's Stage combo to create a 20/20 Marit Lage token."
