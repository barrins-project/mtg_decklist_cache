By playing cards like Heritage Druid and Dwynen's Elite, the deck can amass a large number of elves on the battlefield, allowing for explosive plays. Cards like Collected Company and Chord of Calling help to find these key combo pieces, while Lead the Stampede helps to refill the hand with more elves. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large army of elves and finish them off with a powerful Shaman of the Pack."

By disrupting the opponent's strategy and gradually gaining card advantage, the deck can control the pace of the game and eventually secure a win condition. This is accomplished through a mix of board wipes, targeted removal, and powerful finishers like Celestial Colonnade and the planeswalkers. The mana base is optimized for consistency and the inclusion of Spreading Seas can disrupt the opponent's mana base while providing card draw."
