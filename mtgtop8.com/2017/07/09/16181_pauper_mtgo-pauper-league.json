            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game by assembling Urza's Tron lands to generate a large amount of mana. It utilizes various cards to search for and assemble the Tron lands quickly, as well as to draw cards and recur key spells. The deck can stall the game with counterspells and removal spells, while also setting up powerful combos with cards like Ghostly Flicker and Mnemonic Wall to gain advantage. The end game plan is to overwhelm the opponent with big spells like Rolling Thunder or Dinrova Horror, while also having access to protection spells like Moment's Peace."
