Dictate of Kruphix and Jace Beleren help draw through the deck quickly to find the combo pieces. The deck also includes cards like Exhaustion and Gigadrowse to stop opponents from interacting during the combo turns. Thing in the Ice provides a threat that can help close out the game quickly if the combo is disrupted. The overall goal is to assemble the combo pieces and take enough extra turns to overwhelm the opponent."
