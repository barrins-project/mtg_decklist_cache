The deck also includes cards like Glassdust Hulk and Horror of the Broken Lands to provide additional threats and finish off your opponent quickly. With efficient mana fixing and acceleration from cards like Simian Spirit Guide, this deck aims to overwhelm and outpace your opponent in Modern 1 vs 1 matches."

The deck also includes a variety of removal spells, hand disruption cards, and ways to tutor for specific cards to control the game and push for a quick win. Liliana, the Last Hope provides additional utility and Ranger of Eos can help search for more threats. The key strategy is to lower your own life total to make Death's Shadow a huge threat while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
