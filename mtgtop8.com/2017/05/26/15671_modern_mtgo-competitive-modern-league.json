It utilizes cards like Blood Moon and Molten Rain to disrupt the opponent's mana base, while also locking down the board with Ensnaring Bridge. The win condition is to outvalue the opponent with planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Ajani Vengeant, while also creating a threatening board presence with cards like Assemble the Legion. By controlling the game and limiting the opponent's options, the deck can secure a victory through attrition and card advantage."
