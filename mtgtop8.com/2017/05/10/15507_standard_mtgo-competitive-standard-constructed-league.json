Using cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Honored Crop-Captain to pump up your creatures, as well as Always Watching to give them vigilance and a power boost. Hanweir Garrison and Glory-Bound Initiate provide strong threats, while Hazoret the Fervent can finish off the opponent quickly. With a low mana curve and efficient creatures, this deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board presence to secure a quick victory."
