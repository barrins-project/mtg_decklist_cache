The key strategy is to use cards like Manamorphose and Pyretic Ritual to generate extra mana, while cards like Desperate Ritual and Baral, Chief of Compliance reduce the cost of spells. The goal is to eventually combo off with cards like Gifts Ungiven and Past in Flames to recur spells and cast a lethal Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens for a game-winning burst of damage. The deck is built around efficiency, card selection, and explosive turns to overwhelm the opponent."
