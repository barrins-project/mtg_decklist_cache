Attune with Aether and Woodweaver's Puzzleknot help ramp up energy production, while cards like Harnessed Lightning provide removal. The deck aims to quickly assemble the Marvel combo to overwhelm opponents with its powerful creatures and generate a substantial advantage in the mid to late game. Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Rogue Refiner provide additional utility and card advantage to support the combo strategy."
