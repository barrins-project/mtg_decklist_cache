The deck also utilizes card advantage engines like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Dack Fayden to out-value the opponent. True-Name Nemesis provides a hard-to-deal-with threat, while Punishing Fire gives the deck a repeatable removal option. Thing in the Ice can also serve as a win condition if flipped. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and to provide fetch targets for deck thinning."
