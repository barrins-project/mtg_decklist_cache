By using energy-generating cards like Servant of the Conduit and Attune with Aether, the deck aims to consistently play powerful threats such as Glorybringer and Elder Deep-Fiend. The inclusion of removal spells like Harnessed Lightning and Magma Spray helps the deck maintain control over the game. With a balanced mana base and a mix of creature threats and removal, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with aggressive plays and efficient card choices."
