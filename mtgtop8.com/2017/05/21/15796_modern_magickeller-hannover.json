The deck also includes control elements such as Cryptic Command, Remand, and Mana Leak to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage provide card selection and card advantage, while Lightning Bolt and Electrolyze help to deal with opposing threats. The mana base consists of fetch lands and shock lands to ensure smooth mana development."
