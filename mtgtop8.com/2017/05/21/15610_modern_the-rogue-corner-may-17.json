It also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar to generate card advantage and control the board. Lingering Souls and Bloodghast provide a recurring threat that can pressure the opponent while also synergizing with the sacrifice effects of Smallpox. The mana base includes cards like Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth and Flagstones of Trokair to support the deck's color requirements and provide additional value."
