The deck includes cards like Crop Rotation, Sylvan Scrying, and Expedition Map to tutor for the necessary combo pieces, while also including disruption in the form of Thoughtseize, Duress, and Pithing Needle to protect the combo from disruption. Cards like Vampire Hexmage and Not of This World provide additional ways to protect the combo and ensure its success."
