By using cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Always Watching, the creatures gain additional power and resilience. Declaration in Stone provides removal for opposing threats, while Stasis Snare can deal with problematic creatures. Hanweir Militia Captain offers the potential for a strong late-game presence, while cards like Devoted Crop-Mate and Gryff's Boon help maintain pressure. Overall, the strategy revolves around fast, efficient aggression and maintaining a strong board presence throughout the game."

The deck also includes lifegain and sacrifice synergies with cards like Ayli, Eternal Pilgrim and Syndicate Trafficker.
