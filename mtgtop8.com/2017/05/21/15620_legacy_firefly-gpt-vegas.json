Stoneforge Mystic is used to tutor up powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte, Batterskull, and Sword of Fire and Ice to gain an advantage in combat. The mana base is carefully constructed to support all the powerful spells in the deck, with Wasteland also helping to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can snowball its advantage and win through combat damage or incremental value."

The combination of disruption, removal, counterspells, and card advantage allows the deck to handle a wide range of threats and strategies in the Legacy format."

Glimpse of Nature and Elvish Visionary help draw cards to find key pieces of the combo, while Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger provide additional mana and flexibility. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Deathrite Shaman and Reclamation Sage to deal with opposing threats. It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful combo finish."
