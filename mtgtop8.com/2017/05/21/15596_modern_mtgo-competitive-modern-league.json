The deck focuses on assembling the Valakut combo as quickly as possible while controlling the board with removal and ramp spells. The inclusion of Prismatic Omen and Summoner's Pact helps to ensure consistency in finding the combo pieces, making it a powerful and fast-paced combo deck in the Modern format."

Cards like Manamorphose and Pyretic Ritual help generate extra mana, while Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer reduce the cost of spells. Gifts Ungiven is used to search for essential combo pieces, and Past in Flames allows for the replay of spells from the graveyard to continue the storm combo."
