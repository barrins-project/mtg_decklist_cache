By utilizing cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder, the deck can quickly sculpt its hand and find the necessary threats or answers. Deathrite Shaman provides additional utility and Gurmag Angler serves as a big threat that can quickly close out games. Lightning Bolt and Daze offer additional disruption and tempo plays to keep the opponent off balance."

Cards like Delver of Secrets, Monastery Swiftspear, and Young Pyromancer help provide an early aggressive start, while countering and disrupting the opponent's plays with cards like Daze and Force of Will. Price of Progress punishes opponents who rely heavily on non-basic lands, and Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning provide burn spells to finish off the opponent once their life total is low. The deck aims to close out games quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
