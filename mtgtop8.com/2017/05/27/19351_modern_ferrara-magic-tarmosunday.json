Protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing help to keep your creatures safe while cards like Blossoming Defense and Become Immense add extra power to your attacks. This deck aims to be fast and deadly, ending the game before your opponent has a chance to recover."

The synergy between cards like Steel Overseer and Arcbound Ravager allows for quick pumping of creatures and sacrificing for added value. The inclusion of cards like Etched Champion and Master of Etherium provide additional threats and protection. The mana base is heavily focused on lands that produce colorless mana to support the artifact-heavy deck composition."
