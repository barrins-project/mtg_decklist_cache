The key concept revolves around using cards like Spectral Procession, Raise the Alarm, and Secure the Wastes to generate a large number of creatures. These tokens are then buffed with Honor of the Pure, Intangible Virtue, and Opalescence to become powerful threats. Additionally, the deck includes various control elements like Oblivion Ring, Seal of Cleansing, and Enlightened Tutor to manage the opponent's threats. The deck utilizes Serra's Sanctum and other mana sources to support its strategies."
