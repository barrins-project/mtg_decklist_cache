By using cards like Atog and Fling, you can sacrifice artifacts to deal massive damage to your opponent. Thoughtcast and Prophetic Prism help you draw more cards to keep the pressure on. With a mix of aggressive creatures like Frogmite and Carapace Forger, as well as removal like Galvanic Blast, this deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with a fast and powerful assault."
