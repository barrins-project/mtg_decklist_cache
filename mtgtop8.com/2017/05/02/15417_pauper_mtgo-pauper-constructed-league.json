Using cards like Thoughtcast and Prophetic Prism to draw extra cards and maintain card advantage, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a strong defense. With a strong mix of early aggression and card draw potential, the deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent in order to secure a swift victory."
