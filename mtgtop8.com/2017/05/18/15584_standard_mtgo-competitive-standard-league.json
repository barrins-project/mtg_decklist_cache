The deck also includes card draw and filtering with Censor and Thraben Inspector. Thalia, Heretic Cathar and Spell Queller help to disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining pressure. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient aggro strategy."

By quickly establishing a board presence and applying pressure early in the game, you can control the pace of the match and finish off your opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. With a mix of creatures that can crew Heart of Kiran, removal spells like Unlicensed Disintegration and Fatal Push, and powerful threats like Gideon and Archangel Avacyn, this deck aims to end the game swiftly while maintaining a steady stream of threats."
