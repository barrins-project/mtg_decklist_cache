With cards like Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer reducing the cost of spells, combined with cantrips like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to dig for combo pieces, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo and overwhelm the opponent. Gifts Ungiven is used to tutor for key pieces, while Past in Flames allows for recursion and additional spell casts."
