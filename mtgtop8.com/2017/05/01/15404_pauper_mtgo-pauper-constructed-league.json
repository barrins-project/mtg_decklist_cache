By using a combination of auras like Rancor, Ethereal Armor, and Armadillo Cloak, along with enchantment-based ramp in Utopia Sprawl and Abundant Growth, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a massive, unblockable threat. The inclusion of Cartouche of Strength and Cartouche of Solidarity provides additional removal and protection, allowing the creature to quickly close out the game."
