By generating energy with cards like Servant of the Conduit and Whirler Virtuoso, the deck is able to consistently activate Marvel and put massive threats into play earlier than traditional methods. Nissa, Steward of Elements and Rogue Refiner provide additional card draw and utility, while Harnessed Lightning offers removal. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast, unexpected threats and outvalue them with its energy generation engine."
