The deck aims to outvalue opponents with versatile spells like Mulldrifter and Mnemonic Wall, ultimately finishing the game with a massive spell like Rolling Thunder or Ulamog's Crusher. The key strategy is to efficiently ramp up mana and control the game until overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats."

It utilizes card draw and recursion to maintain card advantage and outvalue the opponent. By using counterspells, removal, and board wipes, it aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and stall the game until it can establish a dominant position. The deck also includes ways to protect itself and gain life, ensuring its survival in the late game where it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful spells and mana advantage."
