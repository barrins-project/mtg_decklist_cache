Lingering Souls provides a steady stream of blockers and evasive threats. Liliana of the Veil helps to disrupt the opponent's hand and board, while also providing a win condition with her ultimate ability. The deck also utilizes mana dorks like Noble Hierarch to ramp into its powerful threats. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and disruption."
