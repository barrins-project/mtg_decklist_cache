The key strategy is to control the board while cycling through the deck to find the right cards to close out the game with a massive Death's Shadow."

The deck also includes ramp spells to accelerate your mana and card draw to find your combo pieces. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt your opponent's game plan while setting up your own win condition through a powerful combo."
