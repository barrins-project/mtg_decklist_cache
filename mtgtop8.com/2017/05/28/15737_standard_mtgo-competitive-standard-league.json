The deck includes card draw, removal, and counterspells to help protect the combo pieces and ensure the deck's consistency. The inclusion of Rogue Refiner and Whirler Virtuoso also provides additional energy generation and board presence. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with massive threats and outvalue them with the efficiency of the energy engine."
