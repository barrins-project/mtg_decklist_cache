Tasigur, the Golden Fang and Gurmag Angler provide additional threats while Snapcaster Mage allows you to reuse key spells. Use Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt your opponent's hand, Stubborn Denial for protection, and Fatal Push and Terminate for removal. Serum Visions and Thought Scour help you dig for your key cards. Overall, the deck aims to be aggressive while also maintaining some control elements."

The inclusion of utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Sea Gate Wreckage further enhances the deck's flexibility and resilience."

The deck aims to control the board through removal spells like Path to Exile and disruption effects, while utilizing the synergy between Eldrazi creatures and Aether Vial to generate incremental advantage. Additionally, the deck can also gain card advantage with Dark Confidant and Tidehollow Sculler."
