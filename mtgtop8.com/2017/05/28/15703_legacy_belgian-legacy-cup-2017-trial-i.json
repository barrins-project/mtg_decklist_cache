It utilizes cards like Ponder, Preordain, and Brainstorm to ensure consistent draws and maximize efficiency. The deck also takes advantage of powerful creatures like Thing in the Ice and Vendilion Clique to apply pressure and maintain control. Additionally, it includes versatile planeswalkers like Dack Fayden and Jace, the Mind Sculptor for further disruption and card advantage. The mana base is designed to allow for flexibility and consistency in casting spells."
