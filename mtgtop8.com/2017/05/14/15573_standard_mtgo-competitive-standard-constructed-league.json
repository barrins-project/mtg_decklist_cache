The key strategy is to ramp up energy production quickly to activate Aetherworks Marvel and cheat out game-winning threats like Ulamog as early as possible, overwhelming opponents with powerful creatures and spells before they have a chance to respond. A balanced mix of energy producers, payoff cards, and removal spells ensures consistency and versatility in different matchups."
