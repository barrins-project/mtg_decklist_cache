The deck also packs a lot of burn spells like Galvanic Blast to deal damage directly to the opponent, making it a fast-paced and aggressive deck that aims to win before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The synergy between artifact creatures and artifact buffs is the key to its success."

The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by casting Blood Moon and Ghost Quarter to limit their resources. Additionally, the deck includes big red creatures like Koth of the Hammer and Chandra, Torch of Defiance to apply pressure on the opponent. The use of rituals like Pyretic Ritual and Simian Spirit Guide allows for explosive plays and the ability to cast multiple spells in a single turn."
