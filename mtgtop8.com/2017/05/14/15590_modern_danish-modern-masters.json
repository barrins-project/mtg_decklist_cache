By disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Detention Sphere, Supreme Verdict, and Mana Leak, the deck aims to maintain board control and outvalue the opponent in the long run. Additionally, the deck utilizes card advantage from Ancestral Vision, Serum Visions, and Snapcaster Mage to ensure it can answer threats and maintain control throughout the game."
