By curving out with efficient threats like Hanweir Garrison and Glory-Bound Initiate, supported by anthems like Always Watching and Honored Crop-Captain, the deck aims to quickly build a wide board presence and pressure the opponent. Additionally, disruptive creatures like Thalia, Heretic Cathar and removal spells like Declaration in Stone help to protect the board and maintain momentum in the early game."
