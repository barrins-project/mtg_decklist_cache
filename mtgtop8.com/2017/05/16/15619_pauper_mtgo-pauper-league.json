With an emphasis on disrupting the opponent's strategy and maintaining card advantage, this Dimir Control deck aims to outlast the opponent and gradually take control of the game. By efficiently managing resources and using cards like Counterspell and Chainer's Edict to answer threats, the deck looks to establish a dominant position and win through attrition. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Sea Gate Oracle and Mnemonic Wall helps to keep the deck's engine running smoothly."
