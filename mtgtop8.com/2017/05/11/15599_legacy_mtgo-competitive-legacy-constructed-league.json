Deathrite Shaman provides additional utility with mana acceleration and graveyard hate. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements, while also utilizing land destruction with Wasteland to disrupt opponents' strategies. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents through consistent resource denial and efficient threats."
