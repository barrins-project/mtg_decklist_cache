The deck aims to curve out efficiently with low-cost creatures like Toolcraft Exemplar and Thraben Inspector, while also utilizing powerful threats like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Heart of Kiran. The inclusion of cards like Fatal Push and Unlicensed Disintegration helps control the board, allowing the deck to maintain pressure on the opponent. The mana base is also carefully constructed to provide consistent access to all three colors needed for the deck."
