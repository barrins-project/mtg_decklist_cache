By using cards like Thoughtcast and Prophetic Prism, the deck is able to draw cards and maintain resources while overwhelming the opponent with efficient creatures. The goal is to be aggressive and take advantage of the synergy between artifacts and creatures to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
