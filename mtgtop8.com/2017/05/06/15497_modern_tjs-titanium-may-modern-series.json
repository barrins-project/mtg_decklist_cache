It also incorporates disruptive elements such as Spell Queller and Path to Exile to control the board and protect its threats. The deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents by efficiently ramping up mana, generating card advantage with Collected Company, and utilizing land synergies like Retreat to Coralhelm and Gavony Township to maximize its creatures' potential."
