It also includes disruptive creatures like Fulminator Mage and Beast Within to control the opponent's resources, ensuring the combo goes off smoothly. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and high-speed plays, taking advantage of synergies between cycling creatures and cascade spells to ensure victory."
