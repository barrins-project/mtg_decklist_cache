The deck utilizes powerful synergies with cards like Champion of the Parish and Thalia's Lieutenant to grow the board quickly. The mana base allows for consistent access to all three colors while also providing some utility with Gavony Township and Cavern of Souls. Overall, this deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain a strong board presence to overwhelm the opponent."
