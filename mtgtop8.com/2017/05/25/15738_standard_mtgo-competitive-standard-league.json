By playing aggressive creatures like Grim Flayer, Walking Ballista, and Verdurous Gearhulk, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Grasp of Darkness and Fatal Push helps control the opponent's board while cards like Blossoming Defense provide protection for key creatures. Overall, the deck focuses on aggressive plays and efficient removal to secure victories."
