The deck aims to stall the game with early removal and counterspells, then gain card advantage with card draw spells and creatures with enter the battlefield effects. The deck also includes a finisher like Thorn of the Black Rose to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. The mana base is built to support the deck's control strategy while also providing some life gain through lands like Swiftwater Cliffs and Dismal Backwater."
