By using cards like Collected Company and Lead the Stampede to find key pieces, along with mana dorks like Llanowar Elves and Nettle Sentinel, the deck can quickly ramp into threats like Shaman of the Pack and Ezuri, Renegade Leader to close out the game. The synergy between all the elves in the deck allows for explosive turns and a consistent game plan focused on overwhelming the opponent with creatures."
