By utilizing cards like Aether Vial and Lord of Atlantis to accelerate and buff the Merfolk creatures, the deck aims to apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Spreading Seas and Harbinger of the Tides. The deck's synergy and tempo strategy allows it to rapidly build up a threatening board state and secure victory through aggressive attacks."
