By ramping up energy production with cards like Servant of the Conduit and Attune with Ather, the deck aims to quickly activate Aetherworks Marvel to put big threats onto the battlefield early in the game. Cards like Whirler Virtuoso and Rogue Refiner provide additional value and card advantage, while removal spells like Magma Spray and Harnessed Lightning help control the board until the combo can be assembled."
