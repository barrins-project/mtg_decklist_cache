            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game by using powerful spells like Force of Will, Swords to Plowshares, and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's strategy. It utilizes Stoneforge Mystic to search for key equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte to gain an advantage in combat. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and control over the battlefield, while True-Name Nemesis is a resilient threat that is difficult to deal with. The deck also includes efficient card draw with Ponder and Night's Whisper, along with counterspells like Counterspell to protect key pieces and maintain control over the game."
