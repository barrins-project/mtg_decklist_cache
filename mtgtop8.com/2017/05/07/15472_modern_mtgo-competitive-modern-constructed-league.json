By filling your graveyard with creatures, you can then bring them all back onto the battlefield with Living End, overwhelming your opponent with a swarm of powerful creatures. Additionally, cards like Beast Within and Fulminator Mage provide disruption for your opponent's game plan while you build up your combo."
