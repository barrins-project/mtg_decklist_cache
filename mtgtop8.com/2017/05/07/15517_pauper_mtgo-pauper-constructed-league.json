By utilizing inexpensive spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, along with cards that deal recurring damage like Curse of the Pierced Heart and Thermo-Alchemist, the deck aims to deplete the opponent's life total as fast as possible. This aggressive strategy is supported by cards like Searing Blaze and Fireblast to maintain pressure on the opponent while also providing reach to finish the game."
