            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to aggressively play creatures and use vehicles like Heart of Kiran and Cultivator's Caravan to quickly build a strong board presence. The deck focuses on playing threats early and efficiently removing opposing creatures with cards like Unlicensed Disintegration and Fatal Push. By maintaining pressure and utilizing planeswalkers like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory through a combination of creature beats and direct damage. Flexibility in mana usage is provided by the lands and vehicles included in the deck."
