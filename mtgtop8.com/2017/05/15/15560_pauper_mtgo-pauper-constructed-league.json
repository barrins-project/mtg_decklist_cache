The deck also includes creatures like Dinrova Horror and Mulldrifter for additional control and card advantage. The key strategy is to ramp up mana quickly, control the game, and outvalue the opponent with card advantage and powerful spells."

The deck aims to apply pressure early in the game with resilient threats like Young Wolf and Skarrgan Pit-Skulk, while also utilizing creatures like Quirion Ranger and Nettle Sentinel to generate additional mana and maintain a steady stream of threats. The deck seeks to close out games quickly by maximizing damage output and taking advantage of its efficient creatures and combat tricks."
