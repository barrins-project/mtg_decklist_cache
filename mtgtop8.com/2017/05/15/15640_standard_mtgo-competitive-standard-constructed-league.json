Removal spells like Fatal Push and Anguished Unmaking help clear the way for your creatures to attack, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize.

The win condition comes from resolving powerful spells like Commit / Memory and Torrential Gearhulk to close out the game. It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win condition through card advantage and efficient removal spells. It is essential to manage resources wisely and make strategic decisions to outvalue the opponent in the long run."
