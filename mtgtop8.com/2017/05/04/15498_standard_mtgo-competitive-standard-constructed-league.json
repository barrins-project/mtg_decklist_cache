With a mix of versatile threats like Glorybringer and Whirler Virtuoso, along with efficient ramp and card selection tools, the deck aims to outvalue opponents and grind out victories in the mid-to-late game. By utilizing powerful planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Nissa, Steward of Elements, the deck is able to generate card advantage and gradually take over the game, while also having access to powerful removal spells like Cast Out and Harnessed Lightning."
