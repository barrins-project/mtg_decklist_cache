The aim is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy, using cards like Galvanic Blast for direct damage and Inkmoth Nexus for an alternate win condition through poison counters. The synergy between artifact creatures and support cards make this deck a formidable force to reckon with in Modern 1 vs 1 matches."
