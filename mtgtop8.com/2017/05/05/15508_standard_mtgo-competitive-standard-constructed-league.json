With a focus on removal like Fatal Push and Cut / Ribbons, as well as powerful threats like Sorin, Grim Nemesis and Glorybringer, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's strategy while generating card advantage and closing out the game with efficient threats. By using a mix of removal, planeswalker abilities, and versatile spells, this deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents in a 1 vs 1 setting."
