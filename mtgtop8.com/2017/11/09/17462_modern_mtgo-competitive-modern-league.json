Protection and evasion spells like Vines of Vastwood, Blossoming Defense, and Distortion Strike help ensure that your infect creatures can connect with the opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize or remove your threats. The deck aims to win the game through explosive and unblockable infect damage."
