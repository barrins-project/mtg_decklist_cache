Distant Melody helps refill the hand, while cards like Quirion Ranger and Viridian Longbow provide additional utility and ways to maximize the Elves' potential. The goal is to swarm the opponent and win through sheer aggression and board presence."

The goal is to establish a fast and strong board presence early on in the game to apply constant pressure and deal damage consistently. The inclusion of mana accelerators like Burning-Tree Emissary and Nest Invader helps to efficiently ramp into the larger threats and buffs, ensuring that the deck can maintain its tempo and aggression throughout the match."
