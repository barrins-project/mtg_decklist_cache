With a focus on aggressive plays, cards like Atog and Temur Battle Rage can end games quickly. The deck also includes removal in the form of Galvanic Blast and Metallic Rebuke to control the board. The key concept revolves around utilizing artifacts to power out threats quickly and overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive game plan."
