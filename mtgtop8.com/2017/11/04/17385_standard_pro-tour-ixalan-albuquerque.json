By utilizing cards like Larger Than Life, Cartouche of Knowledge, and Blossoming Defense, the goal is to deal massive amounts of damage and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of energy-generating cards like Attune with Aether and Servant of the Conduit ensures that the deck can consistently power up its threats and maintain pressure throughout the game."
