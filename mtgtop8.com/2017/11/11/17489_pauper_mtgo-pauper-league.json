The key strategy is to establish a stable board presence while using Pestilence as a win condition, gradually wearing down the opponent's life total. With creatures that can be reused for card advantage and removal spells to deal with threats, the deck aims to outlast opponents and eventually take control of the game with powerful finishers like Pestilence and Crypt Rats."
