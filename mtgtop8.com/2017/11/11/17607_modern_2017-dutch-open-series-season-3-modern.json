The toolbox aspect of the deck provides flexibility in finding the right creatures for different situations, with cards like Qasali Pridemage and Scavenging Ooze for disruption and value. The mana base supports the various colors needed for the combo pieces and toolbox creatures."

            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the opponent's draws and prevent them from getting key cards by using Lantern of Insight and Codex Shredder. Ensnaring Bridge also helps to keep the opponent's creatures at bay. Whir of Invention allows for tutoring key pieces while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Pyxis of Pandemonium and Pithing Needle. The deck also utilizes discard spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's hand. The mana base is designed to provide consistency and support the artifact-heavy strategy."
