The deck aims to quickly reduce its own life total to grow Death's Shadow and Tarmogoyf, while also utilizing cards like Liliana of the Veil and Stubborn Denial to control the board and protect its key creatures. Ultimately, the deck aims to be aggressive and proactive in order to overwhelm the opponent."
