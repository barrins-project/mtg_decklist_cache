By playing efficient creatures like Nettle Sentinel and Skarrgan Pit-Skulk alongside powerful pump spells like Rancor and Elephant Guide, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board state and put pressure on the opponent, overwhelming them before they can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Quirion Ranger and Burning-Tree Emissary allows for additional mana acceleration and flexibility, ensuring a consistent and potent offense throughout the game."
