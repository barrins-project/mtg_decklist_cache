By consistently removing threats and slowing down the opponent's strategy, you can outlast them and eventually win the game through card advantage and out-valuing your opponent. The deck also has options for card draw and recursion to help maintain resources and stay ahead in the late game. The focus is on creating a strong defensive position while gradually building up your own board presence to secure victory."
