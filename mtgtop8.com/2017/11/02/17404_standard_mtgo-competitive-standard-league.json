By putting pressure on the opponent early with cards like Toolcraft Exemplar and Heart of Kiran, and finishing them off with powerful finishers like Hazoret the Fervent, the deck aims to win quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of Aethersphere Harvester and Pia Nalaar helps to provide additional reach and adaptability to different board states. The deck's mana base also supports its aggressive strategy by providing consistent access to the necessary colors for its spells."
