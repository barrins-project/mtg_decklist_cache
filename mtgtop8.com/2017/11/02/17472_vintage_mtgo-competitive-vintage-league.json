By utilizing cards like Bazaar of Baghdad and Golgari Grave-Troll, you can quickly dredge through your deck and put powerful creatures into play. The inclusion of cards like Leyline of the Void and Unmask helps disrupt your opponent's strategy while you build up your own board presence. This deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with a swarm of creatures and take control of the game through powerful combos and graveyard interactions."
