By disrupting the opponent's game plan and applying early pressure, this deck seeks to control the board and finish the game quickly. The inclusion of Faithless Looting helps filter through the deck for key cards while maintaining card advantage. Additionally, the deck can disrupt control strategies with cards like Thoughtseize and Kolaghan's Command."

The deck utilizes cards like Cryptic Command, Supreme Verdict, and Snapcaster Mage to maintain control of the battlefield. The inclusion of cards like Gideon of the Trials and Detention Sphere help to further control the opponent's threats. The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's mana base with cards like Spreading Seas and Field of Ruin. Overall, the deck focuses on outlasting the opponent and slowly grinding out a victory."
