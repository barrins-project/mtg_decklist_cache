Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and card advantage, while cards like Traverse the Ulvenwald help find key pieces of the deck. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and control the game until it can secure a victory."

The deck aims to win the game by dealing 10 poison counters to the opponent, rather than reducing their life total to zero. It also includes disruption tools like Dismember and Apostle's Blessing to protect its creatures from removal and control spells. The deck relies on speed, evasion, and preventing opponent's interaction to achieve victory."
