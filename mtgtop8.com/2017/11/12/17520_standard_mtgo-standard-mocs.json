The deck focuses on controlling the board early on and chipping away at the opponent's life total while using efficient creatures like Scrapheap Scrounger and Dread Wanderer to maintain a relentless aggressive strategy. Aethersphere Harvester provides some flying defense, and Heart of Kiran offers additional reach and evasion. Ifnir Deadlands can also be used to remove threats or finish off an opponent."
