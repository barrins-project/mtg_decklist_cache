            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to utilize the energy mechanic in order to ramp up quickly and play aggressive creatures such as Longtusk Cub and Bristling Hydra. By generating energy through cards like Attune with Aether and Servant of the Conduit, the deck can power out threats early and maintain board presence. The removal spells like Abrade and Harnessed Lightning help control the board while cards like Whirler Virtuoso and Chandra, Torch of Defiance provide additional value and threats. The deck aims to be proactive and pressuring, overwhelming the opponent with efficient threats and removal."
