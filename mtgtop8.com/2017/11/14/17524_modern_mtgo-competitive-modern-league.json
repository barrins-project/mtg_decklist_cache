The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay to deal with opposing threats. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil provides additional versatility and disruption. Bitterblossom and Lingering Souls help generate a constant stream of tokens to maintain board presence and overwhelm the opponent."

By denying the opponent resources and controlling their options, the deck aims to grind out a win through attrition and locking the opponent out of the game."

Using cards like Amulet of Vigor and Azusa, Lost but Seeking, the deck can generate a massive amount of mana and quickly pivot into a win condition. By utilizing Hive Mind to force opponents into casting Summoner's Pact, the player can gain a significant advantage and overwhelm their opponent in a flurry of powerful spells and land drops."
