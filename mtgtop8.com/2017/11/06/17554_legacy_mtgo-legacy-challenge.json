The inclusion of disruption spells like Cabal Therapy and Collective Brutality helps to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan."

Additionally, the deck includes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar to help close out the game.

The deck utilizes cards like Faithless Looting, Exhume, and Reanimate to cheat big creatures like Griselbrand and Iona, Shield of Emeria into play early on. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Thoughtseize and Collective Brutality to control the opponent's hand and board state, allowing the reanimated creatures to dominate the game."
