By using cards like Stoneforge Mystic to fetch equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte, and controlling the opponent's board with cards like Swords to Plowshares, Counterspell, and Force of Will, the deck aims to gain a strategic advantage. Additionally, cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and True-Name Nemesis provide additional ways to assert dominance over the opponent. The inclusion of land disruption with Back to Basics adds another layer of control to the deck's strategy."
