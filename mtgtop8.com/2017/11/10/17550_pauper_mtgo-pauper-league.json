The goal is to quickly overwhelm your opponent with powerful, pumped-up creatures before they have a chance to stabilize or mount a defense."

With efficient card draw and filtering through cards like Ponder and Preordain, the deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents, ultimately winning through consistent aggression and disruption."
