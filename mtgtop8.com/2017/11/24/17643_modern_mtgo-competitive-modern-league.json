The deck gains a significant advantage with the use of artifacts like Cranial Plating and Steel Overseer to pump up these creatures and deal damage to the opponent. The Arcbound Ravager serves as a versatile threat while cards like Galvanic Blast provide direct damage to finish off opponents. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and powerful artifact synergies."
