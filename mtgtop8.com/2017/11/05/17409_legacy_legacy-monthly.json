The deck aims to lock down the board with cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Trinisphere, preventing the opponent from effectively deploying their own game plan. With a focus on disrupting the opponent's resources and overwhelming them with powerful threats, this aggressive deck looks to take control of the game early on and dictate the pace of play."
