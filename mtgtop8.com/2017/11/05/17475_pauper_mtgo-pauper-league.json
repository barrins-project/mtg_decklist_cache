The deck also includes card draw and filtering effects like Mulldrifter and Ancient Stirrings to find the necessary pieces quickly. Control elements like Flame Slash and Wretched Gryff help to maintain board presence and disrupt the opponent's strategy while the deck builds up its resources. Overall, the goal is to control the game until the late game where the Urzatron lands can take over."
