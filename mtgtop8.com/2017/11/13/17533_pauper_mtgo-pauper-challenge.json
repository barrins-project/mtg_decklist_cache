With a low mana curve and efficient creatures like Nettle Sentinel and Burning-Tree Emissary, you can quickly build a board presence and use cards like Rancor and Elephant Guide to pump up your creatures for additional damage. By utilizing the aggro strategy, you aim to outpace your opponent and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize."

The deck also includes recursion with cards like Mnemonic Wall and Ghostly Flicker to continuously reuse key cards. Overall, the deck aims to control the game by out-valuing opponents with its mana advantage and versatile spell options."
