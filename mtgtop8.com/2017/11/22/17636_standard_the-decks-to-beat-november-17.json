The inclusion of removal spells like Fatal Push and Unlicensed Disintegration helps maintain board control, while cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance provide additional card advantage and burn potential. The deck aims to be aggressive and efficient, quickly overwhelming the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
