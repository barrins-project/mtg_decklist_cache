By utilizing cards like Legion's Landing and Oketra's Monument to flood the board with creatures, combined with anthem effects from cards like Angel of Invention and Metallic Mimic, the goal is to quickly build a wide board presence and deal damage before the opponent can establish a strong defense. Removal spells like Cast Out and Ixalan's Binding help to clear the way for attacks while protecting key pieces of the deck."
