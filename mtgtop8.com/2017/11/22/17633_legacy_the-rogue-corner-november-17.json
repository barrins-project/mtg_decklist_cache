            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent quickly with low-cost creatures while disrupting their strategy with cards like Chalice of the Void and Suppression Field. The deck focuses on deploying aggressive creatures such as Aerial Responder, Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, and Palace Jailer to put pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Preeminent Captain and Enlistment Officer allows the player to efficiently deploy more creatures and maintain board presence. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Karakas and Recruiter of the Guard for additional utility and resilience."
