Card draw with Elvish Visionary and Distant Melody helps maintain momentum, while cards like Wellwisher and Spidersilk Armor provide some utility and protection. The deck aims to quickly establish a dominant board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

Once the Urzatron is activated, the deck utilizes control elements such as counterspells, removal, and card advantage to slow down the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck includes various ways to recur key cards like Dinrova Horror and Mulldrifter to maintain board presence and outvalue the opponent. Ultimately, the goal is to establish a strong board state and overwhelm the opponent with powerful spells and creatures."
