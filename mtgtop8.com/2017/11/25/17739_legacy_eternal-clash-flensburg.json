The deck aims to stall the opponent's threats, generate value through card selection and card advantage, while gradually building a board presence with Monastery Mentor. With a versatile suite of interaction, the deck aims to out-grind its opponent and establish control over the game, ultimately winning through attrition and superior card advantage."
