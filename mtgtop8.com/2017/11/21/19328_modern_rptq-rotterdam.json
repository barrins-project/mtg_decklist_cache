It aims to slow down the opponent's progress by countering their spells, removing their threats, and disrupting their mana base. The deck also focuses on card advantage, utilizing cards like Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage to ensure consistent draws. Additionally, the deck includes powerful win conditions in the form of planeswalkers and creature lands, such as Gideon Jura, Jace, Architect of Thought, and Celestial Colonnade, to close out the game after gaining control."
