            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game through countering opponent's spells, removal, and disruption while ramping into big threats like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn through cheat in effects like Through the Breach. The deck also aims to disrupt opponent's mana base with cards like Blood Moon and aim for tempo advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Cryptic Command. The deck has a strong late-game plan with powerful creatures and efficient removal spells, making it difficult for opponents to establish a strong board presence."
