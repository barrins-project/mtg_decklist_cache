            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly creating a wide board of tokens to overwhelm the opponent. Cards like Anointed Procession and Hidden Stockpile help to generate additional tokens, while cards like Fumigate and Settle the Wreckage can clear the opponent's board if necessary. Champion of Wits provides card advantage and utility, and Vraska, Relic Seeker serves as a finisher. The deck also includes some removal spells like Cast Out and Start / Finish to deal with threats. Overall, the strategy revolves around aggressive token generation and efficient creature removal."
