It also utilizes Blood Moon and Magus of the Moon to disrupt opponents' mana bases, while deploying aggressive threats like Goblin Rabblemaster and Quicksmith Rebel to close out games quickly. The goal is to establish early dominance on the board and prevent opponents from mounting a comeback, ultimately securing victory through sheer aggression and disruption."

The deck aims to disrupt opponents with counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce while digging for key combo pieces with cantrips like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain. Cunning Wish offers additional versatility by allowing access to sideboard cards, making the deck adaptable to different matchups. The goal is to overwhelm opponents with big creatures and win the game in just a few turns."
