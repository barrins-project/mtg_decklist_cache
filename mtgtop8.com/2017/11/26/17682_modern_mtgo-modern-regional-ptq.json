By utilizing cards such as Eldrazi Temple and Urza lands to ramp up mana production, along with tools like Chalice of the Void and Relic of Progenitus to disrupt the opponent's strategy, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence with creatures like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer to close out the game swiftly. The inclusion of removal spells like Dismember and All Is Dust provides additional support for keeping the opponent in check while the Eldrazi creatures deliver the finishing blows."
