The deck also includes disruption spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, along with removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember to control the board and protect its threats. The inclusion of Snapcaster Mage allows for extra value from spells in the graveyard, and the deck's mana base is designed to support the deck's heavy reliance on black mana."
