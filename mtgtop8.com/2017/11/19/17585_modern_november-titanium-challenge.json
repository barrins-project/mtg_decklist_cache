            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly ramp up mana and play Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle alongside several Mountains, and then use Scapeshift to search for more Mountains to deal a large amount of damage to the opponent's face or creatures in one turn. The deck includes cards like Primeval Titan to search for more lands and accelerate the combo, while also incorporating removal and disruption spells to control the board until the combo can be executed. It is a high-risk, high-reward strategy focused on assembling the combo pieces and winning in a single explosive turn."
