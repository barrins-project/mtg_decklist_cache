            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy using efficient, low-cost creatures with abilities that allow for mana ramp and card draw. By quickly developing a strong board presence with cards like Elvish Mystic and Quirion Ranger, the deck aims to quickly build up enough mana to cast Lead the Stampede and refill the hand with more creatures. The deck also utilizes pump spells like Vines of Vastwood to push through damage and close out the game quickly."
