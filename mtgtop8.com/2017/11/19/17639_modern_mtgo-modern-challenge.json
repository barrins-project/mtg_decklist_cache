            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly establishing a strong board presence with low-cost and efficient creatures like Young Pyromancer and Monastery Swiftspear, while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push. Lingering Souls and Bedlam Reveler provide late-game value and card advantage. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Terminate to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the deck's strategy is to apply pressure early and maintain control of the battlefield to overwhelm the opponent in a fast-paced matchup."
