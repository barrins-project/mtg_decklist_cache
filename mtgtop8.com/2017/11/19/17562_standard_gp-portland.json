Utilizing mana ramp cards like Attune with Aether and Servant of the Conduit, the deck aims to play threats early and overwhelm the opponent with creatures like Whirler Virtuoso, Longtusk Cub, and Glorybringer. The inclusion of cards like Confiscation Coup and Chandra, Torch of Defiance provide additional removal and card advantage to stay ahead in the game. The key is to maintain pressure and close out the game quickly with powerful creatures and removal spells."

The deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize, utilizing the direct damage potential of cards like Ramunap Ruins and fiery planeswalker Chandra, Torch of Defiance to secure victory. The inclusion of cards like Bomat Courier and Soul-Scar Mage provide additional utility and card advantage in this fast-paced, aggressive strategy."
