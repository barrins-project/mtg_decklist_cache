Tireless Tracker and Courser of Kruphix provide card advantage and Thragtusk, Obstinate Baloth, and Inferno Titan serve as resilient threats. Overall, the strategy is to control the game through disruption and powerful creatures."

Using cards like Remand, Cryptic Command, and Snapcaster Mage, the deck aims to control the board and tempo of the game. Through the Breach provides a quick way to bring out Emrakul and close out the game. Blood Moon is included to punish greedy mana bases and slow down the opponent's plays. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through careful resource management and powerful threats."
