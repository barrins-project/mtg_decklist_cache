            "notes": "The main focus of this Modern 1 vs 1 Aggro - Red Deck Wins archetype is to deal fast and consistent damage to the opponent. This is achieved through efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Rift Bolt, supported by creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide. Blood Moon is used to disrupt the opponent's mana base, while Shrine of Burning Rage helps to build up damage over time. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of direct damage and aggressive creatures, finishing them off quickly before they can stabilize."
