It also aims to disrupt the opponent's mana base with Spreading Seas and Field of Ruin. The win condition is through planeswalkers like Gideon and card advantage engines like Search for Azcanta and Sphinx's Revelation, while also utilizing passive threats like Celestial Colonnade. The deck utilizes a mix of permission spells, removal, card draw, and win conditions to outlast opponents and overpower them in the late game."
