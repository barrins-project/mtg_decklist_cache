The deck aims to slow down the opponent with cards like Blood Moon and Remand, while also being able to dig for key cards with Serum Visions and Opt. Through the Breach allows for a quick win by cheating in Emrakul, while Snapcaster Mage provides versatility by flashing back key spells. The deck also has some land disruption with Spreading Seas and can filter through cards with Desolate Lighthouse."

The inclusion of cards like Skullcrack and Lightning Helix also adds versatility and helps to close out games quickly.

By playing Primeval Titan, you can search for more Valakuts and mountains to deal massive damage to your opponent with cards like Scapeshift. The deck aims to win the game by comboing off and dealing lethal damage to your opponent in one explosive turn. Additionally, cards like Relic of Progenitus and Reclamation Sage provide support and disruption against opposing strategies."
