This deck also has card advantage through Snapcaster Mage and Serum Visions, as well as a threat in Celestial Colonnade. The mana base is built around fetching lands with Flooded Strand, Scalding Tarn, and Hallowed Fountain, allowing for flexibility in casting spells with different color requirements."
