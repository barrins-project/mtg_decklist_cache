By using cards like Atog and Fling, it can deal a large amount of damage in a short amount of time. The deck also utilizes cards like Galvanic Blast and Gearseeker Serpent to control the board and protect its aggressive strategy. With a mix of card draw and mana ramp, the deck aims to consistently generate advantage and apply pressure to the opponent."
