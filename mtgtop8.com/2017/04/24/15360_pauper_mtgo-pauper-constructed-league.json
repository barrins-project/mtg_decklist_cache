            "notes": "The main focus of this Boros Aggro deck is to quickly and aggressively build up a board presence and overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and burn spells. With a mix of artifact synergy and token generation, the deck aims to leverage its small but powerful creatures, along with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, to push through for lethal damage. The inclusion of card draw and mana fixing ensures consistency in executing the aggro game plan, while also providing some resilience against removal and disruption."

It has a mix of card draw and removal spells to keep the pressure on the opponent and maintain card advantage. With a combination of cheap artifact spells and efficient creatures, it aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle. The key strategy is to utilize synergy between artifact creatures and spells to create a powerful and resilient board presence."
