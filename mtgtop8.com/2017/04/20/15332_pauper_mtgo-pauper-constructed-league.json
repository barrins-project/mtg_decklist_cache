It aims to establish a quick board presence with cheap flyers like Spellstutter Sprite and Delver of Secrets, while also generating card advantage and tempo with cards like Ninja of the Deep Hours. By utilizing snow-covered lands for Skred, this deck can deal with threats efficiently while applying pressure with its creatures. The mix of aggressive creatures and control spells make this deck versatile and adaptable to various game situations."
