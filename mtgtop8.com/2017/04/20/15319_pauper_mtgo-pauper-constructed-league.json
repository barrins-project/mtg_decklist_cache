By utilizing cheap and efficient spells like Ponder and Preordain, the deck aims to maintain card advantage and tempo advantage throughout the game. The inclusion of cards like Faerie Miscreant and Spellstutter Sprite adds to the disruptive nature of the deck, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure while controlling the game, ultimately leading to victory."
