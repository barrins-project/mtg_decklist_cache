The deck includes various ways to find and protect the combo pieces, such as Serum Visions and Pact of Negation. It aims to win the game as fast as possible, before the opponent has a chance to establish their own game plan. The deck heavily relies on efficient mana sources like Lotus Bloom and Pentad Prism to fuel its powerful combo."
