The key strategy involves using cards like Manamorphose and Pyretic Ritual to generate additional mana, while using cards like Goblin Electromancer and Baral, Chief of Compliance to reduce spell costs. Gifts Ungiven is used to find key combo pieces, while Past in Flames allows for recycling spells from the graveyard to continue the storm."
