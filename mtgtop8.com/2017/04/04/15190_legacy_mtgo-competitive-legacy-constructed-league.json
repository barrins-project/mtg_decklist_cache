By utilizing cards like Natural Order and Green Sun's Zenith, the deck can fetch powerful finishers like Craterhoof Behemoth to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a massive army of Elves. It aims to win the game in the mid to late game by overwhelming the opponent with a massive board presence and a high amount of mana."

Additionally, Deathrite Shaman provides mana acceleration and graveyard hate. By slowing down the opponent's threats and answering them efficiently, the deck aims to take control of the game and ultimately win through attrition."

Chalice of the Void and Blood Moon are included to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big threats early in the game, taking advantage of the mono red color identity to consistently produce the necessary mana for these game-ending plays."
