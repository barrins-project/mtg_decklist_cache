The inclusion of artifacts like Ancient Den, Ichor Wellspring, and Prophetic Prism adds consistency and card advantage to the deck. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient aggro game plan."

The deck utilizes tempo plays such as bouncing opponent's creatures with Vapor Snag and protecting its own creatures with cards like Bonesplitter. By effectively managing resources and applying pressure, this deck seeks to close out games quickly in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
