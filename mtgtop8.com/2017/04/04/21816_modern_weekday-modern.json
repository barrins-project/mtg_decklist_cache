By utilizing cards like Leonin Arbiter and Ghost Quarter to disrupt their mana base, along with Thought-Knot Seer and Tidehollow Sculler to strip important cards from their hand, you can slow down their strategy. At the same time, utilizing efficient creatures like Toolcraft Exemplar and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, combined with the evasion provided by Flickerwisp and Eldrazi Displacer, allows you to close out the game quickly before your opponent can recover."
