It also includes disruption in the form of Thoughtseize, Duress, and Pithing Needle to prevent opponents from interfering with the combo. Additionally, cards like Not of This World and Sejiri Steppe help protect Marit Lage once it's on the battlefield."

The addition of disruptive creatures like Leovold, Emissary of Trest further enhances the deck's ability to disrupt the opponent's game plan."

            "notes": "The main idea behind this deck is to quickly assemble the resources needed to generate a large storm count and win the game in a single explosive turn. This is achieved through a combination of mana acceleration cards like Rite of Flame and Dark Ritual, card selection/filtering with Ponder and Brainstorm, and the ability to tutor for key combo pieces with Infernal Tutor and Burning Wish. Cabal Therapy and Duress help disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Lion's Eye Diamond and Lotus Petal provide additional mana sources to cast spells and generate storm."
