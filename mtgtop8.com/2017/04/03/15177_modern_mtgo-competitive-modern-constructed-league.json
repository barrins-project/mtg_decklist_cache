            "notes": "The main concept of this Modern 1 vs 1 deck is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and powerful Eldrazi creatures. The deck focuses on using ramp spells like Noble Hierarch and Ancient Stirrings to quickly play out high-impact threats such as Thought-Knot Seer, Reality Smasher, and Drowner of Hope. The deck also includes disruption in the form of cards like Path to Exile and Engineered Explosives to control the board. By efficiently deploying Eldrazi creatures and disrupting the opponent's game plan, this Aggro Eldrazi deck aims to quickly close out games with its powerful threats."
