It also utilizes recursion with cards like Archaeomancer to reuse powerful spells like Counterspell and Chainer's Edict. By maintaining control of the game and out-valuing the opponent, the Dimir Control deck aims to grind out victories in a long game."

The deck also includes multiple control spells and card draw to maintain board presence and draw into the necessary cards.
