By leveraging the affinity mechanic and cards like Myr Enforcer and Frogmite, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a swarm of aggressive creatures. Galvanic Blast provides a burst of direct damage while Atog and Fling offer finishers to close out the game. The deck is designed to be fast and efficient, utilizing the synergy between artifacts and affinity to create a powerful aggro strategy."
