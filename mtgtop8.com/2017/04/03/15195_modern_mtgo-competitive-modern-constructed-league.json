Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer help reduce spell costs and enable explosive turns, while Gifts Ungiven sets up powerful plays by tutoring key combo pieces."

The deck relies on a combination of hand disruption, artifact synergy, and control elements to lock down the game and secure a victory."
