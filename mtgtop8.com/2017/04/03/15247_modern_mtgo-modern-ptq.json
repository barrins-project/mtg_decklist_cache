            "notes": "This deck aims to quickly reduce its own life total in order to power up Death's Shadow, a powerful creature that grows in strength as its controller's life total decreases. By using cards like Street Wraith, Mishra's Bauble, and fetch lands, the deck can easily manipulate its life total to pump up Death's Shadow while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with discard spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize. With efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay, as well as strong win conditions like Tarmogoyf, the deck can quickly overwhelm opponents with its aggressive strategy."

The inclusion of cards like Abrupt Decay and Path to Exile provide removal options for problematic threats. The deck also utilizes card advantage and value through cards like Lingering Souls, Mishra's Bauble, and Traverse the Ulvenwald. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements and help fix the mana for the spells."
