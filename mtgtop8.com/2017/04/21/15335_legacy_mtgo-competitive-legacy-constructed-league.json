The key strategy is to cheat big creatures like Griselbrand and Tidespout Tyrant into play early on, overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats. The deck also includes disruptive cards like Unmask and Thoughtseize to control the opponent's hand and protect the combo. Ultimately, the goal is to win through a quick and explosive reanimation strategy."

The deck aims to control the game with spells like Abrupt Decay, Hymn to Tourach, and Liliana of the Veil while also using countermagic like Force of Will and Daze to protect its threats. The mana base is designed for consistency and mana denial with Wasteland, and the inclusion of Brainstorm and Ponder ensures card selection and manipulation. The deck combines disruption and aggression to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
