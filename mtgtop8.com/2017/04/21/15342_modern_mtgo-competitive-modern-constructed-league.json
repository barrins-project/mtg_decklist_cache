The synergy between cards like Prized Amalgam, Narcomoeba, and Bloodghast ensures a steady stream of creatures entering the battlefield, overwhelming the opponent with creatures. Conflagrate can also be used to deal direct damage to the opponent while also further fueling the graveyard. The goal is to create a powerful board presence and overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
