The inclusion of cards like Inferno Titan and Batterskull provide additional threats and flexibility in different matchups.

By using creatures with infect like Blighted Agent and Glistener Elf, along with pump spells like Berserk and Invigorate, the deck can deal lethal damage in just a few turns. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Daze and Force of Will to protect its creatures and ensure the combo goes off smoothly. Additionally, card draw spells like Brainstorm and Gitaxian Probe help to dig for key pieces of the combo and maintain card advantage."

It includes a mix of cantrips and counterspells to dig for combo pieces and protect against disruption. By resolving a Show and Tell or Sneak Attack, the deck can put a game-winning threat into play ahead of schedule, overwhelming opponents with massive creatures that can close out the game in just a couple of turns. The key is to get the combo pieces in place and execute the combo as efficiently as possible."
