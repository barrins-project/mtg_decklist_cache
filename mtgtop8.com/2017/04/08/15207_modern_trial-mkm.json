The inclusion of flashback spells like Lingering Souls provides additional value and resilience in the late game. The mana base is designed to support a smooth curve and allow for flexibility in casting spells of various colors."

The deck also utilizes disruption in the form of Engineered Explosives and Path to Exile to control the board while pushing damage through with aggressive threats. The inclusion of Eldrazi Displacer provides additional utility and synergy with the deck's creatures. This deck aims to overwhelm opponents with efficient creatures and disruptive spells to secure victories in a fast-paced Modern format."
