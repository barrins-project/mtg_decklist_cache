By using Urza's Mine, Power Plant, and Tower, the deck can generate a large amount of mana to cast devastating spells like Rolling Thunder, Capsize, and Ulamog's Crusher. The deck also features control elements such as counterspells, removal, and card advantage through cards like Mulldrifter and Prophetic Prism. With the ability to control the game early on and ramp into large threats, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its powerful late-game plays."
