The goal is to create a strong board presence early on with creatures like Bloodghast and then use Conflagrate to deal a large amount of damage to your opponent. The key strategy is to dredge through your deck quickly and overwhelm your opponent with powerful graveyard-based plays."

It utilizes a variety of counterspells such as Mana Leak, Negate, and Logic Knot, along with removal spells like Path to Exile and Fatal Push. The deck also includes card draw spells like Think Twice and Sphinx's Revelation to dig deeper into the deck. Ultimately, the goal is to control the game until the player can win through incremental advantage and potentially close out the game with a powerful finisher like Torrential Gearhulk or Celestial Colonnade."
