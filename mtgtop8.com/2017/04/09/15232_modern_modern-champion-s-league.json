The inclusion of colorless removal spells like Dismember and Spatial Contortion allows the deck to control the board, while cards like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger provide a powerful late-game finisher. This deck aims to apply constant pressure and disrupt opponents' strategies to secure a swift victory."
