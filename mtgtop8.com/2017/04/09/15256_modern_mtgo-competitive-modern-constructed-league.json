This allows the player to bring back creatures like Bloodghast and Narcomoeba, triggering effects like Prized Amalgam to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a powerful board presence. Conflagrate can be used to finish off the opponent, making this deck a fast and aggressive combo-based strategy focused on graveyard recursion."

The deck also utilizes card selection and draw spells like Serum Visions and Gifts Ungiven to help find key pieces of the combo."
