By utilizing a mix of counterspells, removal, and board wipes, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and secure victory through card advantage and superior board control."

By deploying threats like Tasigur, the Golden Fang, Geist of Saint Traft, and Gurmag Angler, while also using cards like Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Liliana of the Veil to disrupt the opponent's game plan, the deck aims to establish board control and grind out incremental advantages. The inclusion of cards like Lingering Souls and Smuggler's Copter provide additional value and versatility, allowing the deck to adapt to different situations and strategies."
