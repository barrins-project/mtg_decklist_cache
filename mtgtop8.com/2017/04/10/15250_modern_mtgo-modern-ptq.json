It utilizes cards like Baral and Electromancer to reduce the cost of spells, rituals to generate mana, and cantrips to dig for combo pieces. The key strategy is to set up your graveyard with Gifts Ungiven and Past in Flames to cast a lethal Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens. It is a fast-paced and intricate combo deck that rewards careful sequencing and timing."

By cycling through the deck with cards like Faithless Looting and Cathartic Reunion, players can consistently bring back these creatures from the graveyard and overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of undead minions. Conflagrate can be used as a powerful finisher, dealing damage based on the number of cards in the graveyard. The deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent before they can effectively respond."

The deck focuses on using artifacts like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to search for lands, while also running removal spells like Fatal Push and board wipes like Oblivion Stone to keep the opponent's board in check. The goal is to establish a strong board presence with threats like Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Relic of Progenitus."
