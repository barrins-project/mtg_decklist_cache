It utilizes card draw and recursion effects to maintain card advantage and control the game. With a mix of removal, counterspells, and efficient threats like Mulldrifter and Ulamog's Crusher, it aims to outvalue and outlast opponents in a longer game. The deck also includes utility lands like Swiftwater Cliffs and Expedition Map to help fix mana and provide additional flexibility in gameplay."
