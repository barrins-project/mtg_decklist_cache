By utilizing fast mana sources like Ancient Tomb and City of Traitors, as well as mana reducing effects like Eldrazi Temple and Eye of Ugin, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient threats like Reality Smasher and Endless One. The inclusion of cards like Thorn of Amethyst and Ghost Quarter adds additional disruption to the deck's strategy, making it a fast and resilient Aggro archetype in the Legacy format."
