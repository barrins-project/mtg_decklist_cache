By using cards like Collected Company and Chord of Calling, the deck can quickly find and deploy key pieces like Kitchen Finks, Melira, and Eternal Witness to create a resilient board state. The toolbox nature of the deck allows for adaptability and flexibility in responding to different situations, while the presence of powerful utility creatures like Selfless Spirit and Scavenging Ooze provide additional support and protection. Ultimately, the goal is to out-value and out-maneuver the opponent through efficient creature interactions and synergies."
