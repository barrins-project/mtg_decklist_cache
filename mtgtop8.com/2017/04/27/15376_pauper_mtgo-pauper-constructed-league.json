The deck aims to control the tempo of the game and gradually wear down the opponent's resources until it can establish a dominant position. Additionally, it relies on the synergy between cards like Ghostly Flicker and Archaeomancer to recur powerful effects and gain incremental advantage."

The deck also includes protection spells like Apostle's Blessing and Dispel to prevent opponents from interfering with the aggressive game plan. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a flurry of spells, efficient creatures, and strategic combat tricks to secure a fast victory in Pauper 1 vs 1 matches."
