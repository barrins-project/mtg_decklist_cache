The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a heavily enchanted creature that can deal a significant amount of damage each turn, while also gaining life to increase survivability. The deck leans heavily on hexproof creatures like Slippery Bogle and Silhana Ledgewalker to ensure that the auras cannot be easily removed, making it difficult for the opponent to stop the aggressive assault."
