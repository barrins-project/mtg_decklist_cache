By using Aether Vial and Spreading Seas to disrupt the opponent's mana base, along with buffing and protecting our Merfolk creatures with Lords like Master of the Pearl Trident and Lord of Atlantis, we aim to hit hard and fast. Additionally, cards like Vendilion Clique and Harbinger of the Tides provide additional disruption and tempo advantage. The deck is focused on establishing a strong board presence and leveraging the synergies within the Merfolk tribe to secure victory."
