Through a combination of cantrips like Ponder and Brainstorm, along with counter spells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its combo pieces. The inclusion of Lotus Petal allows for fast mana acceleration, while cards like Omniscience provide additional ways to cheat out big creatures onto the battlefield."
