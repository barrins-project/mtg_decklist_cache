Utilizing cheap and powerful creatures like Young Wolf and Skarrgan Pit-Skulk, along with pump spells like Groundswell and Hunger of the Howlpack, the deck aims to quickly build up a threatening board presence and finish the game before the opponent can stabilize. With a low mana curve and efficient creature interactions like Quirion Ranger and Nettle Sentinel, the deck is designed to be fast and relentless in its aggression."
