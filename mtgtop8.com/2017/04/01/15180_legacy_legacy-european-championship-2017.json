Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger provide additional utility and synergy with the deck's key combo pieces. The inclusion of disruption in the form of Leovold, Emissary of Trest and Reclamation Sage helps to protect the combo and disrupt opposing strategies."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly generating mana and card advantage through the elves' abilities. The key strategy involves using cards like Green Sun's Zenith, Glimpse of Nature, and Natural Order to chain together powerful combos and ramp into explosive plays with Craterhoof Behemoth. The deck also has removal and disruption options like Umezawa's Jitte and Reclamation Sage to handle threats from the opponent. The mana base is optimized for generating large amounts of mana with Gaea's Cradle and other key lands. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of elves and close out the game quickly."
