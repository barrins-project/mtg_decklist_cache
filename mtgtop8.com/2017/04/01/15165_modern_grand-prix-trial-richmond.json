The inclusion of planeswalkers like Chandra and Saheeli provide additional sources of card advantage and board control, while creatures like Snapcaster Mage and Spellskite offer versatile utility. The deck also includes a win condition in Blightsteel Colossus, which can quickly close out games if unanswered. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategies and outvalue them in the long game."
