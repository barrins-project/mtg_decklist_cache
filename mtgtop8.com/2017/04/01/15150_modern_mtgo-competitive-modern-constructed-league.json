Conflagrate can be used as a finisher to deal damage directly to the opponent. The deck seeks to utilize a balance of graveyard recursion and aggressive creatures to win the game."

            "notes": "This Abzan Aggro deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with hand disruption spells such as Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, while also presenting a threat with aggressive creatures like Tarmogoyf and Siege Rhino. The deck utilizes efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Path to Exile to control the board and keep the opponent on the back foot. Liliana of the Veil and Lingering Souls provide additional value and board presence, allowing the deck to grind out games in longer matchups. The deck's mana base is built to support its three-color requirements while also maximizing consistency."
