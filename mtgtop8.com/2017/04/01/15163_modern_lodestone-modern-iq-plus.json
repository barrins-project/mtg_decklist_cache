Cards like Cryptic Command, Path to Exile, and Supreme Verdict help you to deal with threats efficiently, while cards like Runed Halo and Detention Sphere allow you to neutralize problematic permanents. The deck also includes card advantage engines like Think Twice and Sphinx's Revelation to ensure you have the resources to outlast your opponent. Additionally, the inclusion of Snapcaster Mage provides flexibility and value by allowing you to reuse powerful spells from your graveyard."
