Lingering Souls provides additional value and resilience against removal, while hand disruption like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes a small graveyard hate package with Nihil Spellbomb to deal with graveyard strategies. Overall, the deck aims to be proactive and aggressive while disrupting the opponent's strategy."
