The deck also utilizes mana ramp with Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to get ahead on board early. Arcbound Ravager and Vault Skirge provide additional versatility and resilience. The inclusion of burn spells like Galvanic Blast adds some reach to finish off opponents. The deck aims to close out games quickly and aggressively before the opponent can stabilize."
