The deck also includes creatures with abilities that interact favorably with each other, such as Melira, Sylvok Outcast preventing -1/-1 counters from being placed on creatures and persist creatures like Kitchen Finks and Murderous Redcap repeatedly returning to the battlefield. The deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through its toolbox of creatures and combo potential."

It utilizes control elements like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Oblivion Stone to manage the game state and deal with threats. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Emrakul, the Promised End and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to close out games. The goal is to establish a dominant board presence and overwhelm the opponent with big threats and efficient removal spells."
