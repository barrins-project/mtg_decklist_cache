Ancestral Vision and Serum Visions help the pilot draw into key cards, while cards like Snapcaster Mage provide versatility. Additionally, the deck can disrupt the opponent's mana base with Spreading Seas and Ghost Quarter, while maintaining inevitability with recurring lands thanks to Crucible of Worlds."
