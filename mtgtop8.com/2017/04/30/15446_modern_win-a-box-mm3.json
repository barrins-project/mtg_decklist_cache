It also uses cards like Expedition Map, Ancient Stirrings, and Sylvan Scrying to help find UrzaTron lands quickly. The deck's main goal is to control the board with removal spells like Oblivion Stone and Kozilek's Return, while utilizing powerful Eldrazi creatures like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and World Breaker to close out the game."
