The deck also includes burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Fling to finish off the opponent. The mana base consists of artifact lands and efficient mana fixers like Chromatic Star and Prophetic Prism to ensure a smooth curve. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain card advantage through cards like Thoughtcast."
