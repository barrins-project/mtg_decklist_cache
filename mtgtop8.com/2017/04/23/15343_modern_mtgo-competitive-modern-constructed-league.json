It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering key spells with Cryptic Command and Negate, removing threats with Path to Exile and Supreme Verdict, and drawing cards with Serum Visions and Esper Charm. The deck also utilizes Snapcaster Mage to flash back important spells and can generate card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation and Think Twice. It aims to outvalue the opponent and win through attrition with powerful late-game cards like Celestial Colonnade and White Sun's Zenith."
