It contains a mix of cheap counterspells like Daze and Foil, along with powerful control cards like Undermine and Exclude. The win condition is to grind opponents out with card advantage from Accumulated Knowledge and Fact or Fiction, while using efficient removal like Vendetta and Rath's Edge to deal with threats. The small creature suite of Nether Spirit and Air Elemental provide some consistent threats to close out the game."
