By ramping up mana with Utopia Sprawl and Serra's Sanctum, the deck can quickly establish a lock with cards like Moat and Elephant Grass. Enchantress effects like Argothian Enchantress and Enchantress's Presence help draw into more resources, while cards like Sterling Grove and Replenish provide resilience against disruption. The deck can win through various means, such as using Sacred Mesa for an army of flying tokens or Words of War for a direct damage win condition."
