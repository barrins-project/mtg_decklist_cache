The deck also aims to generate value from recurring creatures with Grim Harvest and blinking them with cards like Riftwing Cloudskate and Venser, Shaper Savant. The inclusion of equipment like Loxodon Warhammer on resilient threats like Epochrasite and Phyrexian Ironfoot provides additional value and pressure. The deck can also close out games with finishers like Profane Command and Urza's Factory."
