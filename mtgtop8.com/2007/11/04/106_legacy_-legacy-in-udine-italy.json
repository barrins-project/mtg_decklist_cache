The deck also includes card advantage engines like Dark Confidant and Sensei's Divining Top to maintain a steady stream of threats and answers. By controlling the board and applying pressure early in the game, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory before they can stabilize."

Cabal Therapy helps to disrupt the opponent's plans while Bridge from Below provides additional value when creatures are put into the graveyard."

By using cards like Goblin Lackey to put powerful Goblins onto the battlefield quickly, combined with cards like Goblin Warchief to reduce their costs, the deck aims to swarm the opponent with a horde of Goblins. Cards like Goblin Piledriver and Goblin Ringleader provide additional power and card advantage, while utility cards like Gempalm Incinerator and Goblin Sharpshooter help deal with opposing threats. Overall, the deck's goal is to apply constant pressure and quickly defeat the opponent."
