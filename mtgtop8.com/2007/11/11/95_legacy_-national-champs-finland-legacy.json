The goal is to cast multiple spells in a single turn to build up a Storm count, before finishing off the opponent with a massive Tendrils of Agony or Empty the Warrens. The deck also runs disruption like Leyline of the Void and Orim's Chant to protect the combo. Brainstorm, Mystical Tutor, and Intuition are used for card selection and consistency."
