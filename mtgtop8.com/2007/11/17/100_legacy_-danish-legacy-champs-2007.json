The deck also aims to stall the game with Standstill and utilize Mishra's Factory as a threat. Crucible of Worlds and Wasteland provide additional resource denial tactics, while Fact or Fiction helps with card advantage. The mana base consists of dual lands and fetch lands for consistency and color fixing."
