It utilizes cards like Pernicious Deed and Cabal Therapy to disrupt opponents, while Survival of the Fittest allows for efficient creature tutoring. Academy Rector acts as a valuable resource, sacrificing itself to search for powerful enchantments. Wall of Roots and Sakura-Tribe Elder provide early game ramp and defense. The deck also includes cards like Eternal Witness and Recurring Nightmare for recursion. Overall, the deck aims to maintain control of the board state while assembling key combos for a win condition."
