            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly ramp up mana using cards like Seething Song, Lion's Eye Diamond, and Rite of Flame in order to cast spells like Goblin Charbelcher and Burning Wish to combo off and deal a large amount of damage in a single turn. Cards like Goblin Welder and Pyroblast are included to protect the combo while also providing some control over the opponent's plays. The deck also has the option to generate a large number of tokens with cards like Empty the Warrens if the Charbelcher combo isn't available."
