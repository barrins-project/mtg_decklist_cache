It aims to establish early board presence with creatures like Tarmogoyf and Mogg War Marshal, while also using burn spells like Rift Bolt and Char to finish off the opponent. The use of Greater Gargadon provides a powerful late-game threat that can quickly close out the game. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy by providing consistent access to both red and green mana sources."
