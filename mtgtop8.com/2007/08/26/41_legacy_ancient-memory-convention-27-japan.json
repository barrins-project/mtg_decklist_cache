The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by denying them resources with cards like Wasteland and Standstill, while also protecting its own game plan with counterspells and removal spells like Swords to Plowshares. The use of cards like Intuition and Enlightened Tutor allow for flexibility in finding key pieces of the deck, while Crucible of Worlds adds resilience by recurring lands that have been destroyed."
