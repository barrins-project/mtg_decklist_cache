The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with massive threats like Bogardan Hellkite and Akroma, Angel of Wrath, while disrupting their strategy with cards like Cabal Therapy and Brainstorm. The deck's versatility allows for different avenues to victory, whether it's through brute force or clever manipulation of the graveyard. The combination of speed, power, and disruption makes this deck a formidable force in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
