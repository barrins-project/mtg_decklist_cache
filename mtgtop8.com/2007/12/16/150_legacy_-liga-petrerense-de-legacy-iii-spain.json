Additionally, cards like Smokestack and Armageddon help disrupt the opponent's game plan by destroying lands and permanents. The deck also includes cards like Crucible of Worlds and Wasteland to further disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to establish a strong control over the game using artifacts as prison elements."
