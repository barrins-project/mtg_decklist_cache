The deck then takes advantage of the filled graveyard by using Dread Return to bring back powerful creatures like Bogardan Hellkite and Akroma, Angel of Wrath. It also utilizes Bridge from Below to generate tokens and control the board. Additionally, the deck includes various utility cards like Oona's Prowler and Shelldock Isle for added versatility."
