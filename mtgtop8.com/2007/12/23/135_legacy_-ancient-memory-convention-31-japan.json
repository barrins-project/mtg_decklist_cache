The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also maintaining card advantage and board control to secure a victory."

The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's plays with counterspells like Counterspell and Force of Will, while also using cards like Wasteland to disrupt their mana base. The deck also includes cards like Exalted Angel and Engineered Explosives for additional threats and answers to problematic permanents. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through careful resource management and control."
