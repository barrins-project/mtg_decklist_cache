The deck also includes control elements such as Pernicious Deed and Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck includes a sideboard card Burning Wish which allows for extra versatility and access to additional options during gameplay. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to control the game through graveyard manipulation and disruption while maintaining card advantage."

The deck also includes cards like Narcomoeba and Sutured Ghoul that benefit from cards being in the graveyard. Once enough cards are in the graveyard, the deck can then use Dread Return to bring back a powerful creature like Sutured Ghoul to the battlefield for a potentially game-winning play."

Burning Wish acts as a versatile tutor, allowing the player to search for specific answers or win conditions as needed."

            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to create a powerful combo using enchantments. The deck focuses on generating card advantage and preventing opponents from effectively interacting with your spells by using enchantress effects. This is achieved through cards like Enchantress's Presence and Argothian Enchantress, which allow you to draw cards whenever you cast an enchantment. The combo is completed by using Solitary Confinement and Replenish to create an impenetrable defense while replenishing your resources. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Sterling Grove and Oblivion Ring to offer flexibility and disruption."
