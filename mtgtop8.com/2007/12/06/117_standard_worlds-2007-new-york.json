The inclusion of cards like Thoughtseize and Garruk Wildspeaker allows the player to disrupt the opponent's hand and generate additional resources. The deck utilizes a combination of removal spells such as Shriekmaw, Eyeblight's Ending, and Nameless Inversion to deal with threats. Overall, the strategy is to establish board presence and utilize a mix of aggression and disruption to overwhelm the opponent."
