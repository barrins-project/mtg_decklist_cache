            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to generate a large amount of mana quickly through cards like Dark Ritual, Lion's Eye Diamond, and Rite of Flame, while also utilizing cards like Chrome Mox and Lotus Petal for additional acceleration. The deck aims to cast powerful spells like Infernal Tutor and Burning Wish to search for the key card, Tendrils of Agony, which is then used to deal a lethal amount of damage to the opponent. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Orim's Chant and Xantid Swarm to protect its combo and stall the opponent."
