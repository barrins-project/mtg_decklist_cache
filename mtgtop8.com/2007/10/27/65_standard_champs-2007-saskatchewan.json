By combining efficient creatures like Tarmogoyf and Mogg War Marshal with removal spells like Incinerate and Tarfire, the deck aims to overpower the opponent before they can set up their own strategy. The inclusion of Greater Gargadon as a powerful finisher adds another level of threat for the opponent to deal with. The mana base is streamlined to ensure consistent access to the required colors for spells and creatures."
