By constantly morphing creatures and using blink effects, you can constantly have threats on the battlefield while also disrupting your opponent's plans. Cards like Vesuvan Shapeshifter and Brine Elemental are key in this strategy, while spells like Damnation provide board wipes when needed. With efficient mana acceleration and fixing, you can smoothly transition between different threats and stay ahead of your opponent."
