By using cards like Cabal Therapy, Lotus Petal, and Ichorid, the player can quickly set up their graveyard with crucial pieces like Bridge from Below, Narcomoeba, and Golgari Grave-Troll. Once the graveyard is filled, the player can utilize cards like Dread Return and Cephalid Coliseum to bring back powerful creatures like Flame-Kin Zealot for a game-winning combo. This deck focuses on strategic graveyard manipulation and explosive plays to overwhelm the opponent."
