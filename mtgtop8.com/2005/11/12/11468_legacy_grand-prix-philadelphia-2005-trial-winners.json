Crucible of Worlds synergizes with Wasteland to keep opponents off their mana resources, while Nevinyrral's Disk provides a reset button if the board gets out of control. The deck also has a win condition with Faerie Conclave, Mishra's Factory, and Decree of Justice. Overall, the key strategy is to disrupt opponents' plays, generate card advantage, and close out the game efficiently."
