It employs cards like Golgari Grave-Troll, Life from the Loam, and Deep Analysis to fuel its graveyard strategy, while also running counterspells like Intuition and Duress to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to generate card advantage with Brainstorm and Swords to Plowshares, ultimately winning the game through powerful threats like Psychatog or utility creatures like Genesis and Wonder."
