Key cards like Umezawa's Jitte and Aether Vial help to control the board and push damage through, while creatures like Ravenous Rats and Chittering Rats disrupt the opponent's hand. The deck also includes efficient removal spells like Rend Flesh and Nekrataal to deal with threats. Overall, the strategy revolves around a fast-paced, creature-centric game plan with a focus on disruption and tempo advantage."
