By using low-cost creatures like Chittering Rats and Ravenous Rats, along with removal spells like Rend Flesh and Nekrataal, you can control the board while beating down your opponent's life total. Cards like Nezumi Shortfang and Pithing Needle provide additional disruption, while Umezawa's Jitte and Ink-Eyes, Servant of Oni serve as powerful finishers. The deck also includes various lands to provide mana fixing and utility, allowing for a consistent and aggressive Mono Black Aggro strategy."
