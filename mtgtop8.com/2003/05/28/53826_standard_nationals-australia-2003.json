By using a combination of removal spells, discard effects, and land destruction, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and prevent them from establishing a strong board presence. Once the opponent is weakened, Magnivore can come down as a big threat that can quickly close out the game. This deck thrives on disruption and patience to outlast the opponent's threats."
