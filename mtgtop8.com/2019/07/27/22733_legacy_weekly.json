It also aims to cheat out powerful equipment cards like Umezawa's Jitte and Batterskull using Stoneforge Mystic, and protect its threats with countermagic like Force of Will and Spell Pierce. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game tempo and out-valuing the opponent to secure victory."

The deck also utilizes cards like Chalice of the Void and All Is Dust to disrupt opponents' strategies. By playing aggressive creatures and disrupting the opponent's plans, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and close out the game quickly before they can effectively respond."
