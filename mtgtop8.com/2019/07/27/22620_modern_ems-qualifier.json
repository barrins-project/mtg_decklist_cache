It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering their spells, removing their creatures, and generating card advantage with planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Time Raveler. The deck also utilizes powerful control spells like Cryptic Command and Supreme Verdict to maintain board control. By controlling the game state and out-valuing the opponent, the deck seeks to establish dominance and eventually win the game through incremental advantage."
