Additional cards like Shifting Ceratops and Ripjaw Raptor provide versatility and card draw to maintain momentum. The deck also includes removal spells like Collision / Colossus and Lightning Strike for board control, along with a few utility spells like Commune with Dinosaurs and Thud for added flexibility."
