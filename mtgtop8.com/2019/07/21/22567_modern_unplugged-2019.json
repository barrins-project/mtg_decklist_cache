            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to use cards like Faithless Looting and Cathartic Reunion to quickly fill your graveyard with creatures like Bloodghast and Narcomoeba. By utilizing dredge mechanics with cards like Stinkweed Imp and Life from the Loam, you can constantly bring back creatures from your graveyard and overwhelm your opponent with a fast and powerful board presence. Cards like Creeping Chill and Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis also provide additional pressure and ways to finish off your opponent quickly. The key strategy is to constantly fill your graveyard and take advantage of the dredge mechanic to create a powerful combo deck."
