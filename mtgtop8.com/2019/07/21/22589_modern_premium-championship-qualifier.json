By playing low-cost artifact creatures and utilizing cards like Hangarback Walker, Walking Ballista, and Animation Module, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of powerful creatures. Additionally, the inclusion of Mox Opal and Ancient Stirrings helps to ramp up mana production and ensure consistent draws of key pieces for the deck's strategy."

The win condition is typically through incremental advantage generated by Monastery Mentor tokens, combined with Celestial Colonnade beats.

Once at seven lands, the goal is to play Scapeshift and sacrifice those seven lands to search for Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and six Mountains to deal 18 damage to the opponent's face. Primeval Titan can also help get Valakut and more Mountains into play, while Mwonvuli Acid-Moss can disrupt the opponent's mana base. Keeping the opponent's graveyard in check with Relic of Progenitus is also key."

Aria of Flame adds additional pressure while Thing in the Ice provides a potential board wipe. The deck also includes surgical extraction as disruption and card draw/filtering spells to help find key pieces. Overall, the deck aims to be explosive and aggressive, overwhelming the opponent with a flurry of spells and creatures."
