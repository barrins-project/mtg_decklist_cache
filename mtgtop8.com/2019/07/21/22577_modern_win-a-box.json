By disrupting the opponent's strategy and generating card advantage, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents in a longer game, ultimately winning through incremental advantage and powerful win conditions like Celestial Colonnade."

The centerpiece of the deck is the UrzaTron lands, which when assembled, provide a significant mana advantage. The deck also utilizes Gifts Ungiven to search for powerful spells like Unburial Rites or Supreme Verdict. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win conditions with powerful creatures and planeswalkers."
