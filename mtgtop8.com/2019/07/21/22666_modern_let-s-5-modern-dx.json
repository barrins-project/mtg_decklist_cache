The deck also takes advantage of tribal synergies, with cards like Drogskol Captain and Supreme Phantom boosting the power and resilience of the spirit creatures."

The key strategy is to stall the game until the late game where powerful planeswalkers like Teferi and Jace can take over. Narset limits opponent's draw power while Celestial Colonnade provides a win condition. The deck also includes disruption spells like Force of Negation and Cryptic Command to keep the opponent on the back foot. Overall, the deck aims to control the game's tempo and grind out a victory through attrition."
