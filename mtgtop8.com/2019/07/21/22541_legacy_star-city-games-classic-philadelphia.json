The deck aims to grind out the opponent by generating value with cards like Dark Confidant and Knight of the Reliquary, while also utilizing Wrenn and Six for additional land recursion. The deck also includes versatile removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and control the game until victory."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing artifacts to create a strong early game board presence and disrupt the opponent's strategies. By playing cards like Chalice of the Void and Karn, the Great Creator, the deck aims to control the battlefield and prevent the opponent from making key plays. Urza, Lord High Artificer provides mana acceleration and card advantage, while Trinket Mage searches for important artifacts. The deck also includes versatile cards like Walking Ballista for removal and Karn, Scion of Urza for additional card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with artifact synergy and disruption."
