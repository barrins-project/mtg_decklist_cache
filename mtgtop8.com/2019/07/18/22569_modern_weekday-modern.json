The key strategy is to assemble UrzaTron (Urza's Tower, Mine, and Power Plant) to generate a large amount of mana quickly, allowing for the casting of expensive spells like Emrakul or Ugin. Karn, the Great Creator can also shut down opponent's artifacts while providing additional threats. The deck aims to stall the game until it can play its win conditions or lock the opponent out of the game."
