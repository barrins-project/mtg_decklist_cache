The deck heavily relies on using counterspells like Force of Will and Dovin's Veto to protect its key threats such as Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Monastery Mentor. Card selection and manipulation is important in order to set up advantageous board states, which is why cards like Ponder and Brainstorm are included to help with this strategy."

The key strategy is to use cards like Stitcher's Supplier and Satyr Wayfinder to fill the graveyard with cards like Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis, which can be played for free. Cabal Therapy and Thoughtseize help disrupt the opponent's game plan while cards like Crop Rotation and Elvish Reclaimer help find key pieces like Dark Depths. The deck also includes various lands to support the combo and control aspects of the strategy."
