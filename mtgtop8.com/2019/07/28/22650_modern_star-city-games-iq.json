The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of cheap burn spells and aggressive creatures, while also generating card advantage through cards like Light Up the Stage and Faithless Looting. The deck is designed to be fast-paced and proactive, aiming to close out games quickly through a combination of direct damage and evasive threats."
