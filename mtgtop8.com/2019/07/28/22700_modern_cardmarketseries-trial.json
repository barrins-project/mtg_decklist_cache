The deck aims to be aggressive and efficient, with a mix of burn spells and disruptive cards like Surgical Extraction to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of Aria of Flame provides an alternate win condition and allows the deck to close out games quickly. The key strategy is to quickly fill the graveyard and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."

This mana is then used to play powerful threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Wurmcoil Engine, as well as powerful planeswalkers like Karn Liberated and Karn, the Great Creator. The deck also includes various tools like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus to control the game and disrupt the opponent's strategy.
