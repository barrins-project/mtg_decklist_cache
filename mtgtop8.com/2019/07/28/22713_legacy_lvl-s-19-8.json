By utilizing acceleration from Simian Spirit Guide and Chrome Mox, the deck aims to lock down the board with cards like Trinisphere and Ensnaring Bridge, ensuring victory through overwhelming pressure and resource denial. Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides additional card advantage and removal, while Ancient Tomb and City of Traitors help power out the deck's powerful threats ahead of schedule."
