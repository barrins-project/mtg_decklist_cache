The removal suite of Lightning Bolt, Fatal Push, Abrupt Decay, and Assassin's Trophy helps clear the way for the aggressive creatures to close out the game. The planeswalkers, Liliana of the Veil and Wrenn and Six, provide additional value and control elements to maintain board presence. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and control the game with its versatile removal and disruption spells."

The goal is to find Ad Nauseam, which allows the player to draw their entire deck, and then use Angel's Grace to prevent losing the game due to having no cards left in their library. This allows the player to win through alternate win conditions such as Jace, Wielder of Mysteries or Lightning Storm."

The key strategy involves discarding cards like Vengevine and Lightning Skelemental with Faithless Looting to trigger their abilities and quickly put together a threatening board presence. By leveraging cards like Thunderkin Awakener and Flamekin Harbinger to recur Elementals from the graveyard, the deck can maintain a steady stream of threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With efficient removal like Lightning Bolt and Ball Lightning, the deck aims to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures."
