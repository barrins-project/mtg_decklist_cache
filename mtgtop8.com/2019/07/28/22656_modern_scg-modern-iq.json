By using creatures like Ball Lightning, Hellspark Elemental, and Lightning Skelemental, along with the ability to dig for more threats with cards like Faithless Looting and Collected Company, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. Additionally, the mana base is built to ensure consistent and fast access to the necessary colors of mana for the aggressive game plan."
