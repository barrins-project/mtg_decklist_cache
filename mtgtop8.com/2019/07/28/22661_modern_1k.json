With aggressive creatures like Eldrazi Mimic, Reality Smasher, and Eldrazi Obligator, the deck aims to close out the game swiftly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The deck also includes flexible removal options and utility lands for additional disruption."

Arclight Phoenix is the main win condition that can be brought back from the graveyard by casting three spells in a turn. Light Up the Stage and Faithless Looting help to dig for more spells and keep the tempo high. Blood Moon is included to disrupt opponents' manabases. The deck is aggressive and aims to close out games quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
