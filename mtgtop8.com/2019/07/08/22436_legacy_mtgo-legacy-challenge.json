The deck also focuses on mana denial with cards like Wasteland and can grind out the game with card advantage provided by Brainstorm, Ponder, and the planeswalker Wrenn and Six. The deck aims to quickly close out games by efficiently utilizing its resources and overwhelming the opposition."

In addition to the combo pieces, the deck includes disruption in the form of Thoughtseize, Duress, and Abrupt Decay to protect the combo and disrupt opponents' game plans. The inclusion of Dark Confidant and Sylvan Library helps to maintain card advantage and consistency in executing the combo."

The deck also includes a suite of versatile removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Abrupt Decay to deal with opposing threats. Additionally, the inclusion of Wrenn and Six allows for recurring value and card advantage. This deck aims to establish board dominance early and maintain control throughout the game."
