Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Deputy of Detention and Reflector Mage provide additional removal options to maintain board control."

The inclusion of cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Rest in Peace helps to shut down opposing strategies that rely on card advantage or graveyard recursion. The deck's win condition often comes in the form of Celestial Colonnade or overwhelming the opponent with card advantage from planeswalkers."

By utilizing cards like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Atarka's Command, along with powerful creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The key strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent and end the game as quickly as possible before they have a chance to mount a defense."
