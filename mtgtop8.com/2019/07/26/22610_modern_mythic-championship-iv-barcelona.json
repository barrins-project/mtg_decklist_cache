The deck focuses on controlling the board with removal spells like Oblivion Stone and disruption with cards like Relic of Progenitus, while also utilizing card selection through Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying to ensure consistent and powerful plays. It aims to overwhelm opponents with its high mana efficiency and powerful threats."
