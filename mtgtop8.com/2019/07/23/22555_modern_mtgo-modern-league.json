By combining cards such as Hangarback Walker, Walking Ballista, and Arcbound Ravager with Hardened Scales, players can quickly build a powerful board presence and overwhelm opponents with a combination of modular creatures and direct damage. The deck also includes ways to protect its creatures, such as Welding Jar and Throne of Geth, while utilizing Mox Opal for ramp. The combination of synergy and aggression makes this deck a formidable force in 1 vs 1 matchups."
