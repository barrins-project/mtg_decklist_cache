The deck also includes ways to recur key spells and creatures with cards like Pulse of Murasa and Mnemonic Wall. The win condition is often achieved by stalling the opponent with cards like Moment's Peace and Stonehorn Dignitary, while setting up a massive advantage through card advantage with Mulldrifter and Forbidden Alchemy."
