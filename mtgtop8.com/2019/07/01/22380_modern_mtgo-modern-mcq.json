The inclusion of Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor allows for additional card advantage and flexibility in dealing with various threats. The deck aims to stall the game until it can secure a win condition, such as through creature beats with Celestial Colonnade or ultimate abilities from Teferi, Hero of Dominaria."

By playing powerful creatures like Champion of the Parish, Mantis Rider, and Thalia's Lieutenant, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence. Cards like Aether Vial and Noble Hierarch allow for mana acceleration and efficient creature deployment. Additionally, disruptive elements like Meddling Mage and Deputy of Detention help control the opponent's resources and game plan. The mana base of the deck supports the tribal synergy of Humans while providing flexibility for casting spells of different colors."
