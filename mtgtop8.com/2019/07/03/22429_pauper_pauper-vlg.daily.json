            "notes": "The core idea of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and pump spells in order to deal damage quickly and efficiently. By utilizing creatures with low mana costs and efficient combat abilities, this deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and maintain that pressure throughout. With a strong focus on creature synergy and combat tricks, this Mono Green Aggro deck seeks to outpace the opponent and secure a victory before they have a chance to stabilize."

The deck also focuses on card draw and recursion with cards like Mulldrifter, Mnemonic Wall, and Forbidden Alchemy. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through efficient mana usage and versatile spells."
