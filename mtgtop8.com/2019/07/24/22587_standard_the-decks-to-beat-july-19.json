By sacrificing lands like Field of the Dead, the deck can create a horde of zombie tokens to overwhelm the opponent. Control elements like Teferi, Time Raveler and Prison Realm help to control the board while Hydroid Krasis provides a strong finisher. The key strategy is to quickly ramp up mana, control the board, and overwhelm the opponent with zombie tokens and powerful creatures."
