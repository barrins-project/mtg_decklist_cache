By equipping these artifacts, players can draw cards and generate mana, allowing them to quickly deploy win conditions such as Grapeshot or Sigil of Distinction. The deck also includes cards like Repeal, Noxious Revival, and Retract to protect the combo pieces and ensure a smooth combo execution. The mana base includes fetch lands and shock lands to support the deck's color requirements."

It also utilizes cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Whir of Invention to search for key pieces and maintain card advantage. The inclusion of cards like Mox Opal and Inventors' Fair helps to ramp up mana and search for important artifacts. The deck is built around the idea of locking down the board and controlling the pace of the game to secure victory."
