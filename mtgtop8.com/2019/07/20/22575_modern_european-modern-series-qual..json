Cards like Ugin, the Ineffable and All Is Dust provide removal and additional value, while Karn, the Great Creator can lock down opponents' artifacts. This deck aims to be aggressive and disruptive, putting pressure on opponents from the early turns of the game."

By playing cards like Ethereal Armor, Rancor, and Daybreak Coronet, the creatures become difficult to deal with while also dealing significant damage. To protect themselves, the deck includes Leyline of Sanctity and Path to Exile. With the ability to quickly ramp up damage and protect against targeted spells, the deck aims to take control of the game early and maintain pressure until victory."
