By ramping up with Llanowar Elves and Leafkin Druid, the deck aims to drop impactful creatures like Cavalier of Thorns and Hydroid Krasis. Risen Reef provides additional card draw and helps with mana fixing. Tamiyo, Collector of Tales and Nissa, Who Shakes the World offer a way to manipulate the top of the deck and generate additional resources. Nexus of Fate serves as a win condition by taking extra turns to overwhelm the opponent."
