Utilize Teferi, Hero of Dominaria to generate card advantage and control the opponent's next turn, while Chandra, Awakened Inferno and Sarkhan the Masterless provide powerful win conditions. Saheeli, Sublime Artificer creates expendable blockers and generates value with token creatures. Use cleansing Nova to reset the board if necessary and protect your planeswalkers with counterspells like Spell Pierce. Overall, this deck aims to control the game and outvalue the opponent with powerful planeswalker synergies."
