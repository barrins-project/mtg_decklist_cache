By doing so, the player can then utilize cards like Prized Amalgam and Narcomoeba to swarm the board and bring back Bloodghast from the graveyard. Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis is a powerful finisher that can be cast relatively easily thanks to the graveyard manipulation provided by the deck. Life from the Loam helps to ensure a steady stream of land drops and fuel the combo engine."

This mana is used to play powerful threats like Karn Liberated, Karn, the Great Creator, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The deck also includes powerful control elements like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The goal is to control the game early on, assemble the UrzaTron lands, and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats in the mid to late game."
