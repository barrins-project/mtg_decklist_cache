It utilizes cards like Rite of Flame, Dark Ritual, and Lion's Eye Diamond to generate mana, while also including card draw and discard spells like Thoughtseize and Brainstorm to dig for combo pieces like Infernal Tutor and Ad Nauseam. The deck has access to sideboard cards through Burning Wish to help deal with specific situations and can win the game by either storming off for a lethal Tendrils of Agony or creating a large number of goblin tokens with Empty the Warrens."
