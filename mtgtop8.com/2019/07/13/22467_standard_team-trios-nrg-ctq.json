By ramping into powerful threats such as Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Hydroid Krasis, the deck aims to overwhelm the opposition with large creatures and card advantage. The inclusion of mass manipulation allows for board control and stealing key cards from the opponent. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game tempo and out-valuing the opponent through potent threats and manipulation spells."
