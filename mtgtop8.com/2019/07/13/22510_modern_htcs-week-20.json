Additionally, using cards like Faithless Looting and Light Up the Stage allows for card advantage and digging for more spells to keep the pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to deal damage swiftly and aggressively to win the game in a fast-paced manner."

The deck also aims to efficiently flip Thing in the Ice and use it as a win condition, with Snapcaster Mage providing extra value by allowing spells to be reused from the graveyard. Blood Moon and Magmatic Sinkhole provide additional disruption, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor offers powerful card selection and control over the game. Overall, the deck focuses on maintaining control and outmaneuvering the opponent to secure victory."

The deck aims to control the board through artifact manipulation and card advantage, creating a solid lock on the game while generating a large army of flying Thopter tokens to eventually overwhelm the opponent."
