It focuses on artifact synergy, card selection, and tutoring to create a lockout situation for the opponent while generating a steady stream of tokens and card advantage. The deck also utilizes various hate cards and removal options to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own win condition. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and enable efficient casting of spells."
