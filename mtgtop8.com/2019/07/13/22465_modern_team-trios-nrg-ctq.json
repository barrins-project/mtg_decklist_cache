Using cards like Light Up the Stage and Faithless Looting to draw additional cards and discard Phoenix to get it back in play. Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage provide early pressure on the opponent, while Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Lava Dart help finish them off. Bedlam Reveler provides late-game card advantage, and Fiery Islet and Sunbaked Canyon provide additional card draw options."
