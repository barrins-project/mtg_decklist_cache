By using cards like Noble Hierarch and Aether Vial, the deck aims to accelerate mana production and cheat out creatures faster than the opponent can respond. Cards like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Reflector Mage provide additional control elements. This deck leverages the synergy among Human tribal cards to overwhelm opponents with fast, efficient threats."

By leveraging cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Champion of the Parish to boost the power and toughness of creatures, paired with disruptive cards like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter to control the opponent's hand and options, the deck aims to aggro out and capitalize on the synergy within the Human tribe. Additionally, card advantage and mana efficiency is gained through Aether Vial and Ranger-Captain of Eos."
