The key strategy is to play multiple spells in a turn, triggering the Arclight Phoenix's ability to return to the battlefield from the graveyard. By combining aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with damage before they can stabilize. The deck also includes card draw and graveyard recursion to maintain its tempo and pressure."

The deck also includes disruption in the form of Path to Exile and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to slow down the opponent's game plan. Additionally, cards like Eternal Witness and Ancient Stirrings provide card advantage and consistency to ensure a steady stream of threats. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the Eldrazi creatures and allow for efficient plays."
