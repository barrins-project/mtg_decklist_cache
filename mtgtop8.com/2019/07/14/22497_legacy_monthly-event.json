The deck focuses on fast mana acceleration, protection through counterspells and pump effects, and evasion through creatures with infect. The key strategy is to protect your infect creatures while using pump spells and evasion to deal enough poison counters to win the game before the opponent can stabilize. The deck aims to win the game in a short amount of time by overwhelming the opponent with aggressive infect creatures."
