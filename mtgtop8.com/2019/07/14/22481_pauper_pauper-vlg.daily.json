By utilizing cards like Springleaf Drum and Prophetic Prism to generate mana and draw cards, the deck can efficiently deploy its threats while maintaining card advantage. With cards like Galvanic Blast and Fling providing reach and finishing power, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and relentless assault fueled by its affinity for artifacts."
