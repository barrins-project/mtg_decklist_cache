The deck utilizes powerful creatures such as Tarmogoyf, Grim Flayer, and Dark Confidant to put pressure on the opponent and close out the game quickly. Additionally, the deck has a toolbox approach with Traverse the Ulvenwald to find specific silver bullet cards when needed. The goal is to establish early board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan to secure a victory."
