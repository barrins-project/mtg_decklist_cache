By including cards like Ghitu Lavarunner and Thermo-Alchemist to enable fast damage output, along with Chain Lightning, Lava Spike, and Lightning Bolt for efficient burn spells, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. Searing Blaze also provides removal potential while Curse of the Pierced Heart offers a consistent source of damage over time. With a heavy emphasis on aggressive plays and direct damage, this deck seeks to win the game swiftly."
