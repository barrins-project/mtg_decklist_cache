By utilizing cards like Arcbound Ravager and Steel Overseer, you can quickly create an army of powerful creatures that can overwhelm your opponent. The deck also includes cards like Animation Module and Walking Ballista to further synergize with the +1/+1 counter strategy. With strong mana acceleration from Mox Opal and Ancient Stirrings, you can establish a dominant board presence and quickly close out games with your aggressive playstyle."

            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to abuse graveyard mechanics by constantly filling it with cards like Bloodghast, Gravecrawler, and Vengevine, allowing for powerful combos and constant recursion of creatures. The deck aims to quickly fill the graveyard using cards like Altar of Dementia and Faithless Looting, and then use creatures like Carrion Feeder and Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis to overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Bridge from Below and Stitcher's Supplier to further exploit the graveyard and gain advantage in the game."
