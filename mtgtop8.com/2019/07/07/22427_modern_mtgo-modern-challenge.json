The inclusion of Karn, the Great Creator allows for additional flexibility and disruption with cards like Chalice of the Void and Blast Zone. With the ability to disrupt opponent strategies while rapidly building a threatening board presence, this Aggro-Eldrazi deck aims to overwhelm opponents and close out games quickly."
