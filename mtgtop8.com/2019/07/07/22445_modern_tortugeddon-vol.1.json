It controls the game with counterspells like Remand and Condescend, while also having removal options like Dismember and Warping Wail. The deck's key strength lies in its ability to assemble UrzaTron lands quickly, enabling it to play its high-cost threats ahead of schedule and outvalue the opponent. Additionally, cards like Karn, Scion of Urza provide card advantage and board presence, making it a formidable control deck in Modern 1 vs 1 format."

With a plethora of burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Gut Shot, the deck aims to deal consistent damage to the opponent while maintaining card advantage through spells like Light Up the Stage. Finally, Bedlam Reveler and Finale of Promise provide late-game value and reach to close out the game."
