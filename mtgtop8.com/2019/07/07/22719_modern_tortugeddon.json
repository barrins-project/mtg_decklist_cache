Additionally, the deck includes disruption spells like Remand and Cyclonic Rift to control the opponent's board and Expedition Map to search for key lands. The deck's win condition revolves around overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats and control spells."

Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast, efficient threats and burn spells."
