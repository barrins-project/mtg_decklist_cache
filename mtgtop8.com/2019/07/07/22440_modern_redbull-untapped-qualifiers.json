The deck also includes cards like Surgical Extraction to disrupt opponents' strategies and Aria of Flame as an alternate win condition. With a focus on speed and graveyard synergy, this Aggro - Arclight Phoenix deck looks to overwhelm opponents and close out games quickly."

The key combo piece is Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis, which can be cast for free by delving creatures from the graveyard. Altar of Dementia serves as a sacrifice outlet to mill the opponent's deck and enable the Bridge from Below tokens for further advantage."

Snapcaster Mage and Vendilion Clique provide versatile threats, while cards like Cryptic Command, Force of Negation, and Mana Leak help control the board. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria for additional card advantage and disruption. The mana base is designed to provide consistency and flexibility, with utility lands like Field of Ruin to handle problematic nonbasic lands."
