By quickly deploying threats like Tarmogoyf, Bloodbraid Elf, and Lightning Skelemental, the deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent and close out games before they can stabilize. The mana base is built around fetching the necessary colors for Tribal Flames while also providing the flexibility to cast all spells in the deck. This aggressive strategy aims to overwhelm opponents and win through fast and powerful creature attacks."
