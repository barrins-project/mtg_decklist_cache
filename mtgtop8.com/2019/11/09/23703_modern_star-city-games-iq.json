The key strategy is to utilize cards like Arcbound Ravager and Cranial Plating to power up creatures and take advantage of synergies with cards like Steel Overseer and Mox Opal. By using efficient creatures like Ornithopter and Signal Pest in combination with powerful cards like Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and aggressive plays, ultimately leading to victory through swift and decisive attacks."

The key strategy is to ramp up mana quickly, find the necessary pieces with cards like Once Upon a Time and Ancient Stirrings, and then overwhelm the opponent with massive creatures like Primeval Titan while also having utility lands like Field of the Dead for additional value. The deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and win the game before the opponent can respond effectively."

By utilizing cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer, Oko, Thief of Crowns, and Engineered Explosives, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's plans while gradually building up a dominant board state. With the ability to generate value from cards like Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Mishra's Bauble, the deck seeks to outmaneuver the opponent and secure victory through resource management and strategic play."
