Using cards like Delver of Secrets, Tarmogoyf, and True-Name Nemesis, the deck aims to quickly deal damage and disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Stifle, Spell Pierce, and Wasteland. Wrenn and Six provide card advantage and recursion, while Force of Will and Daze help protect the game plan. The deck's tempo and ability to adapt to different matchups make it a strong contender in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."

The inclusion of planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Wrenn and Six provide additional value and flexibility. The mana base is fine-tuned to support the deck's aggressive playstyle, with a mix of fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistency and stability."

It aims to control the game with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze, while simultaneously dealing damage with Lightning Bolt and creatures like Delver of Secrets and Young Pyromancer. True-Name Nemesis provides a difficult-to-deal-with threat, and Dreadhorde Arcanist allows for recurring spells from the graveyard. The deck also includes fetch lands and Wasteland to maintain mana consistency and disrupt the opponent's resources. Overall, the strategy is to quickly overwhelm the opponent while maintaining control of the game."
