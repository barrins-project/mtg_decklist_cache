            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly ramp up mana through cards like Ancient Tomb and Show and Tell, allowing you to cheat out powerful creatures like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn for game-winning plays. Utilizing counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce, along with protection from Teferi, Time Raveler, the deck aims to disrupt your opponent's game plan while setting up your own win condition. Cunning Wish allows for flexibility in finding answers, while Drawn from Dreams provides card advantage. Overall, the strategy revolves around efficiently getting Omniscience into play and overwhelming your opponent with powerful creatures."
