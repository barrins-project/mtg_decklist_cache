By utilizing cards like Cryptic Command and Path to Exile, it aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and out-value them in the mid to late game. With efficient control tools and a strong late game plan of resolving threats like Entreat the Angels, the deck seeks to grind out victories through card advantage and powerful threats."
