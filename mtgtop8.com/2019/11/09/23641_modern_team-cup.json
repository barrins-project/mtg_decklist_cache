The key strategy involves ramping quickly using lands like Simic Growth Chamber and bouncing lands with bounce lands to generate massive amounts of mana. Once Primeval Titan hits the battlefield, it can search for utility lands such as Field of the Dead or Castle Garenbrig to further strengthen the board state. With the combination of ramp and powerful creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big threats while also having access to versatile cards like Karn, the Great Creator for additional utility."
