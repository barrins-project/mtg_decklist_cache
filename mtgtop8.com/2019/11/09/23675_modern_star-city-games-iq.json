Lingering Souls and Drogskol Captain provide additional threats and protection for our spirits. The deck aims to control the board and chip away at the opponent's life total, while maintaining a steady stream of creatures to overwhelm the opponent. It combines tempo play with aggressive strategies to close out the game swiftly."
