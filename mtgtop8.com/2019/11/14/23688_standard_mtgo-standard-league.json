By utilizing cards like Cauldron Familiar and Witch's Oven for recurring sacrifice triggers, along with Mayhem Devil for extra damage, the deck aims to out-value the opponent while disrupting their game plan with cards like Legion's End and Murderous Rider. With the ability to generate food tokens and draw cards with Trail of Crumbs, the deck can grind out incremental advantages until it can close out the game with powerful threats like Liliana, Dreadhorde General or Massacre Girl."
