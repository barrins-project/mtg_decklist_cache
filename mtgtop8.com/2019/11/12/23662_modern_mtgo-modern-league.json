By cycling through your deck with cards like Cathartic Reunion and Life from the Loam, you can trigger powerful graveyard effects like Creeping Chill and Conflagrate, overwhelming your opponent with a constant stream of creatures and burn damage. This deck focuses on utilizing the graveyard as a resource to generate strong combo plays and outvalue your opponent."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to utilize the powerful Eldrazi creatures to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays. By combining mana acceleration from cards like Noble Hierarch and Eldrazi Temple with efficient creatures like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher, the deck aims to apply early pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Drowner of Hope provide additional flexibility and control options, while cards like Path to Exile and Stubborn Denial help deal with threats and protect the Eldrazi attackers."
