By using low-cost and high-impact creatures like Fervent Champion and Bonecrusher Giant, along with damage-dealing spells like Shock and Slaying Fire, the goal is to constantly pressure the opponent and end the game swiftly. Cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Castle Embereth boost the damage output of the deck, while cards like Experimental Frenzy and Tibalt, Rakish Instigator provide additional card advantage and disruption. The deck aims to win as quickly as possible before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
