It includes cards like Crop Rotation and Sylvan Scrying to search for the combo pieces, along with disruption like Duress and Thoughtseize to protect the combo. Elvish Reclaimer and Vampire Hexmage provide additional ways to accelerate the combo. The deck also includes removal in Abrupt Decay and disruption in Hymn to Tourach. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the combo and provide utility lands like Karakas and Bojuka Bog."
