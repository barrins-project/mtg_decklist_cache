The deck also focuses on leveraging powerful creatures like Gray Merchant of Asphodel, Knight of the Ebon Legion, and Gifted Aetherborn to drain the opponent's life total quickly. Liliana, the Last Hope provides additional utility and recursion, while Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet and Murderous Rider offer additional threats and removal options. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and drain the opponent's life total efficiently."
