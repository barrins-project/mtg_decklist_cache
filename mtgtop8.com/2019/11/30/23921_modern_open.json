The deck also includes disruptive elements with cards like Merfolk Trickster, Harbinger of the Tides, and Brazen Borrower. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for instant speed creature deployment, while cards like Spreading Seas disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the key concept is to build up a strong board presence and apply constant pressure to the opponent."

The deck aims to draw through the deck quickly with cantrips like Opt and Serum Visions, while also utilizing cards like Goblin Electromancer to reduce the cost of spells. The goal is to create a storm count high enough to overwhelm the opponent and finish them off with a flurry of spells."
