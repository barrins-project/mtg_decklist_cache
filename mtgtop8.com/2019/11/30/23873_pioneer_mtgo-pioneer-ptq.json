The key strategy is to use green ramp cards to quickly get out multiple lands and trigger Field of the Dead, generating an army of zombie tokens to overwhelm the opponent. By disrupting their game plan with removal and hand disruption, this deck can stall the game until it can establish its own win condition through the zombie tokens."
