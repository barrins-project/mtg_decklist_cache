By deploying a steady stream of burn spells and efficient creatures like Thermo-Alchemist and Ghitu Lavarunner, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize. The deck also includes cards like Curse of the Pierced Heart to provide consistent damage every turn. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with relentless aggression and finish them off before they can mount a defense."
