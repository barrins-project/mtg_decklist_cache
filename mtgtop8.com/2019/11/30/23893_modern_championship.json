By strategically manipulating your life total, you can create powerful early game threats that can quickly overwhelm your opponent. This deck also utilizes cards like Snapcaster Mage and Serum Visions to maintain card advantage and consistently apply pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Temur Battle Rage can provide surprise burst damage to close out games quickly."

By playing aggressively and consistently casting high-impact spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, alongside creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Kiln Fiend, the goal is to maintain pressure and force the opponent to react defensively. With cards like Bedlam Reveler and Light Up the Stage providing card advantage and refill resources, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
