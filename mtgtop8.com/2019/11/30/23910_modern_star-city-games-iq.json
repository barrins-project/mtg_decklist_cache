By utilizing cards like Stitcher's Supplier and Glimpse the Unthinkable to mill your own deck, you can trigger abilities like Vengevine and Prized Amalgam to come back from the graveyard for additional attacks. Additionally, the deck focuses on dealing direct damage to your opponent's life total with cards like Creeping Chill. Overall, the deck aims to set up explosive turns and quickly close out games."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively control the board and disrupt your opponent's game plan while putting pressure on them with efficient threats. The deck utilizes strong value creatures like Tarmogoyf and Bloodbraid Elf, along with disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Assassin's Trophy. The combination of removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt, along with planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Oko, Thief of Crowns, allows the deck to control the game and dictate the pace of play. The mana base is carefully constructed to enable consistent access to the deck's powerful cards."
