With powerful burn spells like Rift Bolt and Lava Spike, along with versatile cards like Boros Charm and Lightning Helix, the deck can quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

The deck also has interaction and disruption with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek, Fatal Push, and Crypt Incursion. The deck aims to control the game through milling, disrupting the opponent's strategy, and eventually winning the game by milling their entire deck. Oboro, Palace in the Clouds and Watery Grave provide additional mana fixing and utility for the deck."
