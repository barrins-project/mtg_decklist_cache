The inclusion of cards like Knight of the Ebon Legion and Rankle, Master of Pranks allows for flexibility in dealing with various threats, while Smuggler's Copter provides additional card filtering and evasion for the creatures. The deck's consistency is further enhanced by the inclusion of Mutavault and Castle Locthwain."
