Aether Vial and Ancient Ziggurat ensure efficient mana usage, while Cavern of Souls protects against counterspells. The deck's strength lies in its ability to quickly build a threatening board state and apply constant pressure on the opponent."

The end goal is to play Scapeshift to search for Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and a bunch of Mountains, dealing a massive amount of damage to the opponent in one turn. Primeval Titan can also help search for Valakut or other utility lands to further enhance the combo. The deck aims to win quickly and decisively through a powerful Valakut combo."
