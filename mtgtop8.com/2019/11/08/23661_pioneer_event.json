The deck also includes card draw and selection to find combo pieces, counterspells for protection, and a win condition with Torrential Gearhulk. The land base is designed to support the deck's needs for both mana fixing and utility lands. The goal is to control the game and out-value the opponent through card advantage and extra turns."
