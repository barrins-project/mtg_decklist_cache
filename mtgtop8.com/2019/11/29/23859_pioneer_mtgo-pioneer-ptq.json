The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with creatures like Elder Deep-Fiend and Brazen Borrower, while also applying pressure with strong threats like Rekindling Phoenix and Bonecrusher Giant. The mana base allows for smooth color fixing and consistent ramping to support the aggro strategy."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on controlling the game with removal spells and counter magic while ramping up mana to play powerful threats like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Hydroid Krasis. The strategy is to survive the early game with board wipes and disruption, then overwhelm the opponent with massive creatures and card advantage from cards like Sphinx's Revelation. The key is to efficiently ramp up mana with cards like Growth Spiral and Hour of Promise to quickly establish a dominating board presence with lands like Field of the Dead."
