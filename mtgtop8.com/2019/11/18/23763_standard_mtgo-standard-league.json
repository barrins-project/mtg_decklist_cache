The deck also includes win conditions like Teferi, Time Raveler and Finale of Glory to close out the game. The mana base includes utility lands like Castle Ardenvale and Castle Vantress to provide additional options and card filtering."

Chandra, Acolyte of Flame provides additional value and card advantage, while cards like Claim the Firstborn and Rankle, Master of Pranks disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggression and control."
