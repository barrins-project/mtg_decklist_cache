This allows the deck to cast expensive colorless threats such as Wurmcoil Engine, Ulamog, and Karn Liberated. The deck also features powerful control elements such as Oblivion Stone and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to clear the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck is designed to efficiently ramp into powerful threats while disrupting the opponent's strategy."

The deck also includes cantrips like Mishra's Bauble and Thought Scour to dig through the deck for more threats and answers.

The deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on with cards like Champion of the Parish and Thalia's Lieutenant, supported by disruptive creatures like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter. Aether Vial is used to cheat creatures into play while cards like Reflector Mage provide additional tempo advantage. The mana base is optimized for casting Humans efficiently and consistently."
