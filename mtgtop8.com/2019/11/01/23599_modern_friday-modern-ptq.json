The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze adds additional damage and disruption to slow down the opponent's game plan. The deck's mana base is streamlined to support casting these spells quickly and consistently."

By using cards like Chalice of the Void, Thalia, Guarding of Thraben, and Leonin Arbiter to tax your opponent's spells and mana, you can slow down their game plan while developing your own board presence with creatures like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher. The deck also utilizes Eldrazi Temple and Gemstone Caverns to power out threats early and maintain pressure throughout the game."
