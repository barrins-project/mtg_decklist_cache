Shock, Lightning Axe, and Fiery Temper provide removal and reach, while Izzet Charm offers versatility. Strategic Planning and Merchant of the Vale help with card selection and provide additional value. The deck's goal is to apply pressure and overwhelm the opponent with powerful, evasive threats."

The deck also includes some support cards like Sram, Senior Edificer and Once Upon a Time to provide card advantage and card selection."
