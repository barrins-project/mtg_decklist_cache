By combining white creatures with red burn spells, the deck aims to apply pressure to the opponent's life total while also controlling the board with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast. The inclusion of artifacts like Prophetic Prism and Alchemist's Vial also helps to ensure consistent mana production and card draw."
