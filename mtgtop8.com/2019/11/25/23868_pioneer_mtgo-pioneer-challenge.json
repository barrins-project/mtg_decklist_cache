At the same time, the deck aims to ramp up its mana quickly with cards like Elvish Rejuvenator and Hour of Promise to eventually overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of Zombie tokens generated by Field of the Dead. The deck also includes a variety of utility lands to ensure a consistent mana base and options for different situations."

By efficiently playing cards like Once Upon a Time and Hour of Promise, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Tireless Tracker and Elvish Rejuvenator. The key strategy is to outvalue the opponent with a combination of ramping and control elements to establish board dominance and ultimately win the game."
