It utilizes cards like Expedition Map, Sylvan Scrying, and Ancient Stirrings to find the Tron lands efficiently. Once the Tron lands are assembled, the deck aims to play powerful threats like Karn Liberated, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, and Wurmcoil Engine to control the game and win through attrition. The deck also includes utility cards like Oblivion Stone and Karn, the Great Creator to deal with various threats and lock opponents out of the game."
