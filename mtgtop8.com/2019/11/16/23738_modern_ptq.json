By casting multiple spells in a single turn and generating a high storm count, the deck aims to finish off the opponent with a massive Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens. Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer play a key role in reducing the cost of spells, allowing for explosive turns and overwhelming the opponent before they have a chance to react."

It focuses on generating mana quickly with cards like Gilded Goose and Mox Opal, while also utilizing cards like Engineered Explosives and Cryptic Command to control the board. Urza, Lord High Artificer is a key card that can provide additional mana and card advantage. Mishra's Bauble and Thoughtseize help with card selection and disruption. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns to further control the game and pressure the opponent."
