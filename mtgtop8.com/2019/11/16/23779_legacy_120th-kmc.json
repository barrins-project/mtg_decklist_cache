The deck's card selection options, such as Sylvan Library and Dark Confidant, help improve consistency and provide card advantage in the long game."

By combining aggressive creature plays with artifact synergies, the deck aims to outpace and outvalue the opponent in order to secure victory. Key components include Urza, Lord High Artificer and The Antiquities War to generate mana and card advantage, as well as the Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek combo for recurring threats."
