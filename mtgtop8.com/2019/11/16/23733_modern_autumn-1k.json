Thragtusk and Wurmcoil Engine provide additional threats and lifegain, while cards like Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying help search for key pieces. The deck also includes artifact hate with cards like Relic of Progenitus and Karn, the Great Creator, allowing for flexibility and disruption against opponents. Ultimately, the goal is to establish a dominant board presence and overwhelm the opponent with big threats and powerful spells."

Oko, Thief of Crowns provides additional disruption and removal options. The deck aims to establish early board dominance and maintain pressure on the opponent to quickly close out the game."
