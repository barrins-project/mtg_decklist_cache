The burn spells like Chain Lightning, Lava Spike, and Lightning Bolt serve as direct damage sources to close out the game, while Price of Progress can punish opponents for playing non-basic lands. Overall, this deck aims to win through a combination of creature attacks and direct damage spells."

With the ability to sacrifice creatures for value with Cabal Therapy and potentially bring out an early Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis, this deck aims to overwhelm and outvalue opponents in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."

The main goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of goblin creatures and deal damage quickly before the opponent can establish their game plan. Key cards like Goblin Chieftain and Goblin Warchief provide buffs to all goblins, while others like Grenzo, Dungeon Warden and Goblin Ringleader help maintain card advantage and board presence. The deck also includes removal like Goblin Cratermaker and Grenzo to deal with threats from the opponent."
