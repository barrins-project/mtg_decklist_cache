Cards like Chandra's Spitfire and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell increase damage output, while Cavalcade of Calamity and Chandra, Acolyte of Flame provide additional damage sources. Castle Embereth enhances the power of our creatures, making them even more threatening. With an emphasis on speed and efficiency, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
