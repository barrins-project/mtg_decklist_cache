By using cards like Mortify, Kaya's Wrath, Doom Foretold, and Teferi, Time Raveler, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and limit their resources while generating advantage with cards like Guild Globe and Golden Egg. With a mix of removal, card draw, and powerful threats like Dance of the Manse and Cavalier of Dawn, the deck aims to outlast opponents and eventually overwhelm them with its versatile control strategy."
