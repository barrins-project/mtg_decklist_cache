The deck utilizes cards like Street Wraith, Mishra's Bauble, and Thought Scour to dig through the deck and enable these threats. Additionally, the deck includes disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Stubborn Denial to control the opponent's game plan. This deck aims to be aggressive and proactive, putting pressure on the opponent while also disrupting their strategy."
