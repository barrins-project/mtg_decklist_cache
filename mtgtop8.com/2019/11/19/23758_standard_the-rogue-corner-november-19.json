By leveraging the card advantage provided by Edgewall Innkeeper and the utility of cards like Brazen Borrower and Merfolk Secretkeeper, the deck aims to control the board while pressuring the opponent's life total. The inclusion of strong finishers like The Great Henge and Jace, Wielder of Mysteries allows the deck to close out games decisively, making it a formidable force in the Aggro archetype."
