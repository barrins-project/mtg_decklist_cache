Elvish Reclaimer and Crop Rotation help find the combo pieces efficiently. The deck also runs a small number of creatures like Dark Confidant and Vampire Hexmage for additional utility. The mana base is finely tuned to support the combo while still being able to cast its spells effectively."

It uses powerful card selection spells like Ponder and Brainstorm to find key combo pieces, while disrupting the opponent's hand with cards like Duress and Thoughtseize. The main goal is to cast a high storm count spell like Tendrils of Agony or Ad Nauseam to win the game in a single explosive turn. The deck aims to be fast and efficient in executing its game plan."
