With a mix of counterspells, removal, and card draw, the deck aims to control the pace of the game until it can close out with a finisher like Fireball or Lightning Bolt. The mana base includes lands that provide color fixing and recurring value with Mystic Sanctuary. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and grind out a win through careful resource management."
