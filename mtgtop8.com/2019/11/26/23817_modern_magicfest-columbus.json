Cards like Creeping Chill and Gravecrawler provide additional value and synergy with the graveyard strategy. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and graveyard recursion, quickly establishing a strong board presence and pressuring the opponent in a fast-paced Modern 1 vs 1 game."
