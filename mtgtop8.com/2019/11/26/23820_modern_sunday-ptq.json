By consistently milling cards with cards like Stinkweed Imp and Shriekhorn, the deck can trigger these creatures' abilities and overwhelm the opponent with an army of creatures. Cards like Creeping Chill and Conflagrate provide additional reach and damage to close out the game. Life from the Loam helps to ensure a steady stream of lands and fuel for future dredges. The deck aims to win quickly and decisively through explosive graveyard synergies."

Oath of Nissa and Once Upon a Time help with consistency and finding key pieces, while Devoted Druid can further ramp up mana. The deck focuses on mono green creatures, with a mix of card draw and mana acceleration to create a strong aggro strategy."

By playing efficient creatures like Champion of the Parish and Thalia's Lieutenant, the deck looks to quickly build a wide board presence. Cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Meddling Mage disrupt opponents' game plans while cards like Aether Vial and Noble Hierarch help accelerate the deck. Reflector Mage and Deputy of Detention provide tempo plays, allowing the deck to maintain pressure on the opponent while maintaining control of the battlefield."
