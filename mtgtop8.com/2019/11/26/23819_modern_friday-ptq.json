By leveraging cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer, Karn, the Great Creator, and Oko, Thief of Crowns, the deck aims to generate value and card advantage while slowing down the opponent's game plan. Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Mishra's Bauble provide additional card advantage and fuel for the deck's synergies. With a focus on control elements like Cryptic Command and Metallic Rebuke, the deck seeks to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a longer game."
