            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game through powerful planeswalkers and board wipes, while utilizing Fires of Invention to cast spells for free. The goal is to stall the game with cards like Deafening Clarion and Narset, Parter of Veils, until you can overwhelm your opponent with big threats like Sarkhan the Masterless and Kenrith, the Returned King. The deck includes a toolbox of cards in the sideboard to access with Fae of Wishes, allowing for flexibility in answering different threats or situations."

With cards like Bonecrusher Giant, Fervent Champion, and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient assault. Using burn spells like Shock and Skewer the Critics, along with the advantage from Light Up the Stage, the deck looks to maintain pressure and finish the game before the opponent can stabilize."
