Urza, Lord High Artificer is the centerpiece of the deck, allowing for explosive mana generation and the ability to combo off with Sword of the Meek and Thopter Foundry. The deck also includes ways to tutor for specific artifacts and shut down opposing threats using cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Pithing Needle. Overall, the key concept is to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through efficient artifact synergy and control elements."

It utilizes cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer, Oko, Thief of Crowns, and Engineered Explosives to generate advantage while disrupting the opponent's game plan. Emry, Lurker of the Loch provides recursion for key artifacts, while Cryptic Command and Metallic Rebuke offer counterplay and protection. By combining efficient threats with versatile answers, the deck aims to maintain control of the game and grind out victories through card advantage and board control."
