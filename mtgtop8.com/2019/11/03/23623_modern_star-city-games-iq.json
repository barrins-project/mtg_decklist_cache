The deck aims to control the game with board wipes like Oblivion Stone and All Is Dust, while also utilizing planeswalkers like Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to further establish dominance on the battlefield. The deck's key strategy is to overwhelm opponents with high-cost threats and powerful planeswalker abilities."

The deck also includes utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Bojuka Bog to disrupt the opponent's game plan."

The deck also includes interactive spells like Cryptic Command and Path to Exile to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Teferi, Time Raveler provides additional control and protection for the combo. The mana base includes snow-covered lands to support Ice-Fang Coatl and Astrolabe for card advantage and flexibility."
