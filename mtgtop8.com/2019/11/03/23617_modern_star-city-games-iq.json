Once Primeval Titan is in play, the deck aims to tutor for strong lands like Field of the Dead or utility lands like Bojuka Bog to either overwhelm the opponent with zombie tokens or disrupt their strategy. The deck also includes a toolbox of lands that can be tutored for with Tolaria West to handle different situations efficiently."

The deck includes pump spells to make the creatures larger and harder to block, as well as protection spells to keep them safe from removal. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy, with a mix of green and blue sources for casting spells efficiently. The key strategy is to attack with infect creatures and pump them up to deal lethal damage before the opponent can stabilize."
