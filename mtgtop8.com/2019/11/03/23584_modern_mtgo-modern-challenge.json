By utilizing cards like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear alongside spells like Lava Spike and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to apply consistent pressure to the opponent and close out the game quickly. The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan and prevent them from gaining life or stabilizing. Overall, the deck prioritizes aggression and direct damage to overwhelm the opponent and secure victories."
