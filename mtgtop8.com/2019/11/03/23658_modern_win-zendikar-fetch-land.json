Additionally, cards like Visions of Beyond and Mission Briefing help maintain card advantage and find crucial pieces of the combo.

It aims to outvalue the opponent in the mid to late game and eventually win with powerful threats like Geist of Saint Traft and equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Fire and Ice. The mana base is designed to consistently cast spells of all colors while also providing utility with cards like Field of Ruin. The deck's flexibility allows it to adapt to various matchups and strategies."
