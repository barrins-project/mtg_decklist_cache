The key strategy is to efficiently use cards like Kor Skyfisher and Glint Hawk to repeatedly return artifacts for value, while also utilizing removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Journey to Nowhere to control the board. The deck also includes cards like Palace Sentinels to maintain card advantage, ensuring a steady stream of threats to keep the pressure on the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to quickly finish off the opponent before they can stabilize."
