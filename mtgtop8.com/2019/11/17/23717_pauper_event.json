The inclusion of Faeries and Ninjas allows for additional card advantage and tempo plays, while also providing evasion to bypass opposing blockers. Utilizing a mix of burn spells and counterspells, the deck looks to disrupt the opponent's game plan while steadily chipping away at their life total."
