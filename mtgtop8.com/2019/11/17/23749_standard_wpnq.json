The deck also has flexibility with cards like Once Upon a Time to find key pieces and Fabled Passage for mana fixing. It combines ramp, control, and potent threats to dominate the game."

The inclusion of Wilderness Reclamation allows for extra mana generation and the ability to cast multiple spells in a turn. It also has the ability to sideboard in specific counterspells like Mystical Dispute and Aether Gust depending on the matchup."
