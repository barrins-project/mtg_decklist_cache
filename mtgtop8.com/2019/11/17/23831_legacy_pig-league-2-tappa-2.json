Utilizing cards like Force of Will and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan while deploying threats like Tarmogoyf and Snapcaster Mage to close out the game. The deck also utilizes efficient mana fixing with cards like Arcum's Astrolabe and Wrenn and Six to ensure it can cast its spells consistently. By controlling the game and gradually gaining advantage, this deck aims to outvalue the opponent and secure victory."
