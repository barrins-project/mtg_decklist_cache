The deck also includes Prismatic Strands and Rally the Peasants for protection and extra damage. Palace Sentinels and Guardian of the Guildpact provide card advantage and resilience. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain tempo to overwhelm the opponent in a Pauper 1 vs 1 matchup."
