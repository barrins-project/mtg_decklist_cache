            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the game by utilizing cards that allow for resource management, removal of threats, and generation of value through sacrificing and recurring creatures. The key strategy involves setting up a board state with Cauldron Familiar, Witch's Oven, and Mayhem Devil to create a loop of sacrificing and dealing damage to opponents. This loop is further supported by cards like Trail of Crumbs and Korvold, Fae-Cursed King to draw cards and gain advantage. The deck seeks to outvalue opponents and control the board until it can win through attrition."
