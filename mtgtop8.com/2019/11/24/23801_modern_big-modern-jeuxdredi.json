It does this by utilizing various disruptive creatures like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, Leonin Arbiter, and Thought-Knot Seer, which increase the cost and effectiveness of the opponent's spells. Additionally, the deck has flicker effects like Flickerwisp and Eldrazi Displacer, which can further disrupt the opponent's board and provide value by re-triggering ETB effects. The deck also has a combo finisher in Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker, which can generate a lot of value by copying powerful creatures like Blade Splicer or Restoration Angel."

By searching for land cards such as Tolaria West, Simic Growth Chamber, and Boros Garrison, this deck can quickly assemble the lands needed to generate lethal combat damage with Primeval Titan. The inclusion of utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Castle Garenbrig provide additional versatility in dealing with opponent's threats and accelerating the combo. The deck also includes reactive cards like Pact of Negation and Reclamation Sage to protect the combo and disrupt opponent's strategies."
