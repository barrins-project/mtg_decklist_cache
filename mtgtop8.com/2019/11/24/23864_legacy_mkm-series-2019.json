By utilizing cards like Force of Will, Swords to Plowshares, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, the deck aims to disrupt opponents' strategies while generating incremental advantages over time. The inclusion of cards like Arcum's Astrolabe and Teferi, Time Raveler help to ensure that the deck has the resources and flexibility needed to outmaneuver opposing decks and emerge victorious in the long game."
