By including cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel, Goblin Guide, and Monastery Swiftspear along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Skewer the Critics, the deck aims to apply pressure early in the game and finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. The deck also features some versatility with cards like Boros Charm and Lightning Helix to close out games or deal with problematic permanents."
