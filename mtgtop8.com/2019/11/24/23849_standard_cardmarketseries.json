By playing creatures at the end of the opponent's turn and countering key spells, the deck aims to maintain tempo and disrupt the opponent's game plan while building a strong board presence. The inclusion of Nightpack Ambusher adds an additional threat and clock for the opponent to deal with, making it difficult for them to stabilize and turn the game in their favor."
