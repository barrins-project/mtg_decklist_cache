The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Wrenn and Six to generate incremental advantage. Additionally, mana denial with cards like Wasteland helps to keep the opponent off balance and disrupt their game plan."

The goal is to cast a flurry of cheap cantrips like Ponder and Preordain to find the necessary combo pieces like Dark Ritual and Infernal Tutor to then cast Tendrils of Agony or Ad Nauseam for a game-ending storm count. Thoughtseize and Duress disrupt the opponent's game plan while Dark Petition and Past in Flames provide additional utility and recursion. The deck aims to win the game in a single explosive turn."
