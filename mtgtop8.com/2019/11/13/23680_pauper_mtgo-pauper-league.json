By using cards like Rancor, Ethereal Armor, and Armadillo Cloak, the deck aims to quickly pump up its creatures and overwhelm the opponent with damage. The deck also includes cards like Utopia Sprawl and Abundant Growth to help fix mana and draw through the deck. Overall, the key strategy is to aggressively push for damage with buffed-up creatures and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
