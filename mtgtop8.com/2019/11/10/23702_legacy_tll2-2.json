The deck also utilizes the disruptive lands Wasteland and Rishadan Port to further hamper the opponent's resources and keep them on the back foot."

Cabal Therapy is used for disruption while Careful Study helps with card selection. The lands are mainly focused on providing the necessary color fixing for the deck."

It aims to generate value through card draw and mana ramp with cards like Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Mox Opal, while also maintaining board presence with cards like Baleful Strix and Urza, Lord High Artificer. The inclusion of blue cards like Force of Will and Brainstorm provide additional control and versatility in combat. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive artifact creatures and disruptive spells."
