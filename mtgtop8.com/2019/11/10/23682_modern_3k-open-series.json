By using cards like Eldrazi Temple and Urza's lands to accelerate mana, the deck can cast big threats like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer ahead of schedule. The inclusion of Chalice of the Void and All Is Dust further disrupts the opponent's game plan, while cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, the Ineffable provide additional utility and removal options. The objective is to establish a dominant board presence and close out the game swiftly."

Collected Company helps to refill the board quickly, while cards like Unsettled Mariner provide protection for your creatures.

By using cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer and Oko, Thief of Crowns, the deck aims to generate advantage through card draw, mana ramp, and powerful artifacts. With a mix of counterspells, removal, and efficient threats, the deck aims to outvalue and out-tempo the opponent while establishing a strong board presence. The inclusion of key combo pieces like Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek provides additional win conditions and utility in various matchups."
