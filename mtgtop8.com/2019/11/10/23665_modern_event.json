It aims to use cards like Snapcaster Mage and Mystic Sanctuary to recycle spells for multiple uses, while also relying on cards like Terminus and Cryptic Command to reset the board state in its favor. The deck aims to buy time and generate card advantage until it can establish a win condition, such as resolving Teferi, Hero of Dominaria or Jace, the Mind Sculptor to close out the game."
