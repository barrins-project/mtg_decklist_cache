The deck also utilizes Aether Vial to cheat creatures onto the battlefield and gain tempo advantages. With a strong curve of efficient creatures and disruptive spells, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly and close out the game before they can stabilize. By maximizing synergy between human creatures and tribal support, the deck is able to present a cohesive and powerful strategy in the Modern format."
