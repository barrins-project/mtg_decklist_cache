Once you have the mana advantage, you can start casting powerful spells like Expansion / Explosion and Niv-Mizzet, Parun to take over the game. Brazen Borrower provides flexibility and tempo plays, while cards like Aether Gust and Flame Sweep help you deal with threats efficiently. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver your opponent to secure victory."
