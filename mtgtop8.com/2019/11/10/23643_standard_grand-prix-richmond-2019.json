The deck also focuses on generating card advantage and recursion with cards like Trail of Crumbs and Liliana, Dreadhorde General. Massacre Girl and Murderous Rider provide additional removal options, while Cauldron Familiar and Wicked Wolf provide a strong creature base. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's three-color requirements and ensure consistent access to the necessary colors."
