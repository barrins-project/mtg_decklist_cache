The key strategy is to consistently cycle through the deck, find key combo pieces like Nexus of Fate and dig through cards with Dig Through Time to ensure a steady stream of extra turns. By leveraging cards like Growth Spiral and Opt for card advantage and ramp, the deck aims to quickly set up a winning scenario by chaining together multiple turns and overwhelming opponents with powerful plays."
