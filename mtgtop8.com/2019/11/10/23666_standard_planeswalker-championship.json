The deck also includes spells like Shock and Cavalcade of Calamity to deal direct damage to the opponent. With a focus on aggression and fast-paced gameplay, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of Chandra, Acolyte of Flame and Tibalt, Rakish Instigator provides additional support and utility to keep the pressure on the opponent."
