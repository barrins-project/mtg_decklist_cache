By playing powerful one-drops like Knight of the Ebon Legion and Bloodsoaked Champion, combined with disruption from Thoughtseize and removal spells like Fatal Push, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and maintain board control. The inclusion of cards like Smuggler's Copter also helps to filter through the deck and provide additional reach. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats and disruption."
