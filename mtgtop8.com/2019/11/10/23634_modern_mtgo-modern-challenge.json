As Foretold and Electrodominance provide a way to cast Living End for free or at instant speed, while control elements like Cryptic Command and Force of Negation help protect the combo. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a sudden influx of powerful creatures and maintain control of the game until the combo can be executed."
