The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan through tempo plays like Stifle and spell-based removal, while also generating card advantage with cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder. By establishing a strong board presence and controlling the game tempo, the deck can close out the game quickly before the opponent can recover."
