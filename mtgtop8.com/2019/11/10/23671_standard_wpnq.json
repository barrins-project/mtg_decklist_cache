Angrath's Rampage and Claim the Firstborn provide removal and disruption, while cards like Chandra, Acolyte of Flame and Theater of Horrors give the deck additional card advantage and late-game reach. The deck's overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and resource advantage."
