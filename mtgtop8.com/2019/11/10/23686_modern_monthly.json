The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering key spells, removing threats, and generating card advantage with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The inclusion of snow lands and Arcum's Astrolabe allows for fixing mana and drawing cards, while cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns provide versatile answers to various threats. The deck also utilizes creature cards like Snapcaster Mage and Ice-Fang Coatl for additional value and to maintain board presence."
