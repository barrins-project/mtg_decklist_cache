By effectively utilizing creatures like Valley Dasher, Mudbrawler Cohort, and Goblin Bushwhacker, along with spells such as Lightning Bolt and Goblin Grenade, the deck aims to deal damage swiftly and efficiently. This aggressive strategy, combined with a low mana curve and consistent creature presence, allows the deck to apply pressure from the early turns and maintain relentless aggression throughout the game."
