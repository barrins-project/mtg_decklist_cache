By utilizing powerful creatures like Gruul Spellbreaker, Pelt Collector, and Questing Beast, combined with direct damage spells like Domri's Ambush and Collision / Colossus, the strategy is to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of Embercleave and Skarrgan Hellkite adds additional threat and finishing potential. Domri, Anarch of Bolas provides additional support and card advantage. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive early game with a mix of forests, mountains, and dual lands."
