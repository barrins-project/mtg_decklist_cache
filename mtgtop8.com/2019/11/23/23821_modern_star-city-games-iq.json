By utilizing cards like Azusa, Lost but Seeking and Sakura-Tribe Scout, the deck aims to ramp up mana production and cheat big threats into play ahead of schedule. With the synergy between land bounce lands, Gemstone Mine, and the namesake Amulet of Vigor, the deck can generate immense value and overwhelm opponents with its powerful threats and efficient combo potential."

It aims to use Scapeshift to search for lands and trigger Valakut's ability to deal damage to the opponent. The deck includes cards like Prismatic Omen to ensure all lands are Mountains for Valakut's ability. The goal is to quickly ramp up to win through overwhelming damage with Valakut triggers. The deck includes additional ramp and land destruction spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building towards its combo."
