By utilizing creatures like Blighted Agent and Glistener Elf along with pump spells like Might of Old Krosa and Scale Up, the goal is to get to 10 poison counters as fast as possible. Protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense help to keep your creatures safe while you race to victory. The deck also includes some card draw and disruption to maintain its tempo and consistency."
