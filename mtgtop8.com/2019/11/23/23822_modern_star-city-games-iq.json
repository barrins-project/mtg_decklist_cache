This allows the deck to play multiple threats quickly or set up a lethal attack out of nowhere.

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Cryptic Command and Force of Negation, while also having removal like Path to Exile and Terminus to deal with threats. The deck also focuses on card advantage through cards like Snapcaster Mage and Mystic Sanctuary, allowing the player to outvalue their opponent and grind out a win."
