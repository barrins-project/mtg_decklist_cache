The deck includes cards like Imperial Recruiter, Enlightened Tutor, and Goblin Engineer to search for and tutor the combo pieces. Other cards like Smuggler's Copter and Karn, the Great Creator provide additional utility and disruption. The deck also includes interaction and protection cards like Red Elemental Blast, Pyroblast, and Ensnaring Bridge to control the game and protect the combo. The goal is to assemble the combo quickly and disrupt the opponent's game plan effectively."
