The deck utilizes cards like Aether Gust to disrupt the opponent's plans, while also having access to powerful planeswalkers like Nissa, Who Shakes the World. The deck also employs creatures like Risen Reef and Cavalier of Thorns to generate card advantage and ramp. Additionally, the deck features the flexibility to clone important creatures with Quasiduplicate and Finale of Devastation, providing additional value and threats. The goal is to establish a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and card advantage."

By combining the aggressive nature of Rakdos colors with cards like Knight of the Ebon Legion and Embercleave, this deck aims to take control of the game early and close it out quickly. Utilizing cards like Blacklance Paragon and Stormfist Crusader for removal and card advantage further enhances the deck's strategy of overwhelming the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
