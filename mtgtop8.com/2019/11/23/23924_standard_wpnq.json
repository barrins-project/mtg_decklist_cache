Gadwick, the Wizened provides card draw and tempo advantage, while Ral's Outburst offers a win condition. The mana base is designed to consistently cast spells and activate Castle Vantress for additional card selection. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt opponent's game plan and outvalue them in the late game."
