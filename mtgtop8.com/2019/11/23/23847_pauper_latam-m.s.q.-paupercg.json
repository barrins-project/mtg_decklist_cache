The key strategy is to flood the board with Elf creatures while using cards like Lead the Stampede and Distant Melody to draw more cards and maintain momentum. The deck also utilizes cards like Timberwatch Elf and Wildheart Invoker to pump up Elves and deliver lethal blows to the opponent. Additionally, cards like Wellwisher and Essence Warden help to gain life and stabilize against aggressive opponents. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of Elves and finish them off quickly."
