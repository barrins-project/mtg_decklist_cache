It utilizes cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Deafening Clarion to slow down the opponent's strategy, while also running powerful creatures like Cavalier of Gales and Kenrith, the Returned King to finish the game. With a mix of removal, card draw, and threats, this deck aims to maintain board control and outvalue the opponent in the late game."
