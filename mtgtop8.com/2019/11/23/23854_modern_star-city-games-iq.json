By generating mana with cards like Gilded Goose and Mox Opal, as well as leveraging the abilities of Urza, Lord High Artificer, the deck can quickly deploy threats and answer opposing threats with cards like Engineered Explosives and Cryptic Command. The synergy between cards like Sword of the Meek and Thopter Foundry allows for incremental advantage, while powerful planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns provide additional disruption and win conditions. The deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents through efficient use of its resources."
