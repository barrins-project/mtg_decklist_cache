The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by using cards like Meddling Mage and Reflector Mage, while also benefiting from tribal synergies with Thalia's Lieutenant and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben. Aether Vial allows for quick creature deployment, while mana fixing is provided by Ancient Ziggurat, Cavern of Souls, and Unclaimed Territory. The deck's efficient creature base combined with disruption and mana acceleration makes it a strong contender in the Modern format."

The deck also includes some control elements with cards like Metallic Rebuke and Oko, Thief of Crowns to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The snow-covered lands and Astrolabe provide additional deck thinning and fixing. Overall, the deck aims to create a powerful board presence while maintaining control over the game."
