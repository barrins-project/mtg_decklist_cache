The deck focuses on early disruption with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push, while also providing card advantage through Smuggler's Copter. The deck's creatures, including Knight of the Ebon Legion and Murderous Rider, are efficient and aggressive, with the ability to grow or provide additional utility. With a solid mana base and a mix of evasive and resilient threats, the deck aims to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total and secure victory through consistent aggression."
