By leveraging cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer and Thopter Foundry, the deck can generate a steady stream of tokens and incremental advantage. The inclusion of cards like Whir of Invention and Goblin Engineer provide flexibility and the ability to tutor for crucial pieces. The deck aims to control the game through a combination of artifact synergy, card advantage, and disruption, ultimately leading to victory through attrition and board dominance."
