The main focus is on explosive starts and efficient land sequencing to outpace opponents and establish a dominant board presence."

Through cards like Cathartic Reunion and Life from the Loam, the deck aims to dredge and return these creatures to the battlefield repeatedly, overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of creatures. Creeping Chill provides additional reach and finishing power, while Conflagrate offers a way to deal direct damage and clear opponent's threats. The deck is built around graveyard synergy and efficient creature recursion to out-value and out-tempo the opponent."
