With powerful planeswalkers like Teferi and Jace, as well as equipment like Swords and Batterskull, the deck aims to stabilize the board and generate card advantage over time. The inclusion of Stoneforge Mystic gives the deck additional options and flexibility in its threats, allowing it to adapt to different matchups and situations. Overall, the deck is designed to grind out wins through incremental advantage and efficient plays."
