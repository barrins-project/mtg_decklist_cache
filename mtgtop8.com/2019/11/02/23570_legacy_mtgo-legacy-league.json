The goal is to assemble the necessary cards for a big storm turn, where the player can cast multiple spells in a single turn and ultimately finish the game with a Tendrils of Agony or Ad Nauseam. The deck also includes disruption in the form of discard spells like Duress and Thoughtseize to protect the combo."

The deck also utilizes cantrips like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain for card selection and digging through the deck. The key win condition is to cast Ad Nauseam to draw a large portion of the deck, then use Infernal Tutor to find the combo piece or Burning Wish to grab the win condition from the sideboard."
