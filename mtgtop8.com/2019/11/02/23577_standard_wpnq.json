The deck's mana base enables consistently casting threats and holding up counterspells. Lochmere Serpent provides a late-game threat, while Once Upon a Time helps find key creatures and lands. Overall, the deck aims to quickly establish a board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
