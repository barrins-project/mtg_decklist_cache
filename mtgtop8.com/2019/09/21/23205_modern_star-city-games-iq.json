By utilizing the Dredge mechanic effectively, the deck can quickly overwhelm opponents with a stream of powerful creatures without relying on traditional methods of drawing cards. Additionally, cards like Creeping Chill provide additional reach and life gain, ensuring that the deck can outlast opponents in longer games."

It leverages the ability to tutor for key artifacts with Whir of Invention and Goblin Engineer. The deck also utilizes the Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek combo to create a constant stream of blockers and life gain. Urza, Lord High Artificer provides ramp and card advantage, while cards like Mox Opal and Mishra's Bauble help to generate mana and draw cards. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and outvalue them in the late game."
