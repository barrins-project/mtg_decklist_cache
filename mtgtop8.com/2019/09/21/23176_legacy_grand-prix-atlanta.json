This mana is then used to cast spells like Tendrils of Agony and Ad Nauseam to create a storm count, which is increased by casting multiple spells in a single turn. The deck also includes cards like Thoughtseize, Duress, and Infernal Tutor to disrupt the opponent's game plan and ensure the combo goes off successfully. The main win condition is to generate a high storm count and cast Tendrils of Agony for lethal damage."

The deck also takes advantage of the opponent's nonbasic lands with Price of Progress. Additionally, Fireblast allows for a burst of damage, and Eidolon of the Great Revel punishes the opponent for casting spells."
