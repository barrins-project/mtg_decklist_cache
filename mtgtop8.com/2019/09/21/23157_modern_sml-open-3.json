Once Valakut is online with enough Mountains in play, players can use Scapeshift to deal massive damage to their opponent by sacrificing their lands and fetching more Mountains. The deck also utilizes Hour of Promise to search for specific lands like Field of the Dead for additional threats and blockers. The goal is to assemble the combo pieces quickly and overwhelm the opponent with massive burst damage."

Aether Vial is also used to cheat creatures into play at instant speed, giving you the advantage in combat and keeping your opponent on their toes. This deck aims to apply pressure early and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
