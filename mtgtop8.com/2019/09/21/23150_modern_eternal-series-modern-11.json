The deck focuses on card advantage and versatility, with cards like Cryptic Command and Snapcaster Mage. It also utilizes the snow-covered land mechanic to take advantage of cards like Ice-Fang Coatl and Arcum's Astrolabe. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's plans, remove threats, and outvalue the opponent in the long game."

The inclusion of disruptive cards like Path to Exile and Mangara of Corondor help control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan, while mana dorks like Birds of Paradise and Noble Hierarch help ramp into bigger threats. The deck also utilizes card advantage with Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Fauna Shaman to help maintain its aggressive tempo."
