The inclusion of cards like Defense Grid and Chalice of the Void helps to protect the combo and disrupt opponent's plans. Overall, this deck aims to quickly set up a game-winning combo and control the outcome of the match."

Using cards like Hymn to Tourach, Inquisition of Kozilek, Thoughtseize, and Kolaghan's Command, the deck aims to strip the opponent of resources while also generating card advantage with cards like Baleful Strix and Snapcaster Mage. Along with countermagic like Force of Will, the deck can answer threats efficiently with removal spells like Fatal Push, Lightning Bolt, and Liliana's Triumph, ultimately aiming to outvalue and outplay the opponent in a long game."
