By utilizing low-cost spells and creatures with abilities that pump them up when casting spells, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The deck focuses on efficiency and maximizing damage output each turn to pressure the opponent and secure a swift victory. The inclusion of card draw and land that can be cycled for more cards ensures consistent and potent aggression throughout the game."
