It combines efficient creatures with powerful planeswalkers to disrupt the opponent's strategy and eventually win the game through incremental advantage. By using the synergy between Stoneforge Mystic and equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine, this deck establishes a strong board presence while providing ways to survive and outvalue the opponent in the late game. The mana base is well-built to support the control elements and ensure consistency in casting spells."

Thassa, God of the Sea provides additional card selection and evasion, while powerful finishers like Master of Waves can rapidly flood the battlefield with elemental tokens. Overall, the key strategy revolves around fast, aggressive plays and tribal synergy."

The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with Overgrowth, Utopia Sprawl, and Arbor Elf to generate a large amount of mana for big plays. The ultimate goal is to cast Tooth and Nail to search the library for powerful creatures like Primeval Titan, Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, and Elderscale Wurm to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory. The deck also includes cards like Birds of Paradise and Garruk Wildspeaker to provide additional mana acceleration and card advantage."
