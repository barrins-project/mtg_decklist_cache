The goal is to set up explosive turns where multiple creatures are brought back from the graveyard and swung for lethal damage in a single combat phase."

The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with cards like Farseek and Primeval Titan, while also controlling the board with removal spells like Lightning Bolt. The goal is to accelerate into enough lands to trigger Valakut's ability multiple times and overwhelm the opponent with direct damage from the mountains entering the battlefield."
