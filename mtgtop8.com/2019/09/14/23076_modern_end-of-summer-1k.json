By fetching Mountains to trigger Valakut's ability, the deck aims to deal lethal damage to the opponent in one turn. Cards like Search for Tomorrow and Sakura-Tribe Elder help accelerate the mana base, while Anger of the Gods and Lightning Bolt provide removal and control options. The inclusion of Prismatic Omen ensures all lands count as Mountains, maximizing the effectiveness of Valakut's ability. Overall, the deck prioritizes assembling the combo pieces to win the game efficiently."
