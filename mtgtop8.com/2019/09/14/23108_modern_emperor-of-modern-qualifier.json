It also utilizes control elements such as counterspells and bounce spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of artifacts like Expedition Map and Chalice of the Void allows for additional flexibility and disruption. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and outvalue the opponent through its powerful late-game threats and versatile answers."
