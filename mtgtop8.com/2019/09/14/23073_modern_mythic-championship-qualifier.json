It utilizes efficient creatures like Snapcaster Mage and Stoneforge Mystic to apply pressure while also providing utility. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor adds another dimension to the control strategy. The deck's mana base allows for flexibility in casting spells of different colors. Overall, the deck aims to out-value the opponent by efficiently managing resources and controlling the flow of the game."
