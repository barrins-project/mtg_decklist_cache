The deck also includes cards like Oblivion Stone and Walking Ballista for removal and disruption.

By constantly flickering creatures with cards like Soulherder and Ephemerate, the deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Path to Exile while also drawing cards and disrupting the opponent's game plan. The Bant color combination ensures access to powerful cards like Coiling Oracle, Ice-Fang Coatl, and Deputy of Detention, while also providing access to versatile counterspells like Force of Negation. The deck's goal is to overwhelm the opponent with its efficient creatures and disruption spells."
