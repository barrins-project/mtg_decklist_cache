The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while also generating card advantage through cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Narset, Parter of Veils. Monastery Mentor provides a win condition by creating tokens, and cards like Back to Basics and Council's Judgment help to lock down the opponent's resources. The deck also utilizes cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder to filter through the deck and find key cards to control the game."
