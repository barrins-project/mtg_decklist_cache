By utilizing cards like Curious Obsession to draw more cards and protect key creatures with Dive Down and Siren Stormtamer, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan with counterspells like Wizard's Retort and Spell Pierce. Tempest Djinn and Pteramander serve as strong finishers to close out games quickly. Lookout's Dispersal and Merfolk Trickster add additional flexibility and control options to the deck."
