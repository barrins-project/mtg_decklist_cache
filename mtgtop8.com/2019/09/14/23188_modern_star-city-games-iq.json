The deck utilizes a combination of disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, removal spells like Fatal Push and Assassin's Trophy, and efficient creatures like Tarmogoyf and Snapcaster Mage. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Liliana, the Last Hope provides additional value and disruption. The deck aims to end the game quickly through a combination of creature aggression and disruption, giving the opponent little opportunity to stabilize."
