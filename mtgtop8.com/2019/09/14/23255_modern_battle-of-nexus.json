It also includes various artifact tutors and utility cards to manage threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent through card advantage and incremental advantage generated by its synergistic pieces. The control elements present in the deck help to stall the game and set up the combo win condition efficiently."
