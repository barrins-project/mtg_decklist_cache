The inclusion of colorless lands like Wastes and utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Blast Zone further enhance the deck's ability to adapt to different matchups and disrupt opponents' strategies."

It aims to generate endless Thopter tokens with Sword of the Meek and Thopter Foundry while controlling the board with cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Pithing Needle. Urza, Lord High Artificer serves as the deck's centerpiece, providing mana acceleration and card advantage. The deck can also tutor for key artifacts with Whir of Invention and maintain card draw consistency with Mishra's Bauble and Ichor Wellspring. Overall, the deck aims to control the game through efficient artifact interactions and powerful creature generation."
