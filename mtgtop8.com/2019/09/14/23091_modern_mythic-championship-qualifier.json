The key concept revolves around using cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer, Thopter Foundry, and Sword of the Meek to generate a steady stream of tokens while keeping the opponent's resources in check with cards like Thoughtseize and Ensnaring Bridge. The deck also includes various utility artifacts like Grafdigger's Cage and Pithing Needle to handle opponent's strategies. The deck excels at outlasting opponents and slowly building up a dominant board presence."

It utilizes cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer, Goblin Engineer, and Whir of Invention to search for key pieces and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also includes various artifacts to draw cards, produce mana, and protect key pieces. Overall, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and establish a strong board presence while disrupting their game plan."
