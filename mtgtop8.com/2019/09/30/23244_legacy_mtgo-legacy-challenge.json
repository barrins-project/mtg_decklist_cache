This strategy aims to overwhelm opponents with an army of creatures from the graveyard, utilizing cards like Cabal Therapy to disrupt opponent's game plan while fueling its own engine. The deck's goal is to win through combos and overwhelming board presence created from the graveyard."

The deck also includes card advantage engines like Narset, Parter of Veils and Snapcaster Mage, as well as win conditions like Monastery Mentor. The mana base is optimized with snow-covered lands and fetch lands to ensure consistent access to all colors of mana. The deck aims to out-value and out-control the opponent until it can secure a win."
