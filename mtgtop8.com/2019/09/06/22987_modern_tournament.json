By protecting its creatures from targeted removal and buffing them with aura cards like Rancor and Ethereal Armor, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast, aggressive plays. Supporting cards like Satyr Enchanter provide card draw to maintain momentum. The strategy revolves around creating a board state that is difficult to deal with, pressuring opponents and closing out games quickly."
