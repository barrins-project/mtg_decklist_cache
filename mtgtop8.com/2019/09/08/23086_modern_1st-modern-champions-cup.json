It looks to establish card advantage with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Time Raveler while applying pressure with efficient threats like Stoneforge Mystic and Restoration Angel. The mana base is designed for consistency and flexibility, with utility lands like Field of Ruin to disrupt opponent's lands. The overall strategy is to outvalue the opponent and grind them out in a longer game."
