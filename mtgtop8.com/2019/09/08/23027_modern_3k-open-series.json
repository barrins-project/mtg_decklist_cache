The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Spell Snare and Mana Leak, while also generating card advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Cryptic Command. By efficiently controlling the game and then deploying threats like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine, this deck seeks to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent."

The deck also utilizes cards like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to dig for key combo pieces."

Utilizing a combination of counterspells like Force of Negation, Mana Leak, and Cryptic Command, along with removal spells like Path to Exile and Fatal Push, the deck aims to maintain control of the game until it can deploy powerful threats like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. The deck also includes card draw and selection spells like Opt and Esper Charm to ensure consistency and provide answers to a variety of situations."
