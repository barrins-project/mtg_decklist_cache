The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating incremental advantage through efficient card draw, planeswalkers, and equipment. By controlling the board and dictating the pace of the game, this deck aims to outvalue the opponent and secure victory through a combination of inevitability and powerful threats. The combination of removal, countermagic, and card advantage engines allows the pilot to navigate various matchups and emerge victorious in the end."
