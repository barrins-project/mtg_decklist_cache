By controlling the board and slowing down the opponent's progress, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent, eventually winning the game through attrition. The inclusion of bounce lands and cards like Mystical Teachings allow for versatility and flexibility in dealing with various threats. The deck also has access to lifegain and graveyard hate to further disrupt the opponent's strategy."
