The deck aims to quickly reduce its own life total to make Death's Shadow a formidable threat, while using efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to maintain board control. The inclusion of Mishra's Bauble and Street Wraith helps to fuel delve cards and trigger Death's Shadow's ability."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck revolves around assembling the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Tower, Urza's Power Plant, Urza's Mine) to generate large amounts of mana and cast powerful threats like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, and Wurmcoil Engine. The deck also includes various ways to search for and tutor for the Tron lands, disrupt the opponent's graveyard with cards like Relic of Progenitus, and sweep the board with cards like Oblivion Stone and All Is Dust. The goal is to control the game, ramp up quickly, and overwhelm the opponent with big threats."
