By using cards like Empyrean Eagle, Sephara, Sky's Blade, and Favorable Winds, the creatures become stronger and harder to block. Siren Stormtamer and Spell Pierce help protect your creatures from removal spells or counters. The deck aims to curve out with low-cost creatures like Faerie Miscreant and Healer's Hawk, then finish the game with a powerful attack from the air. The synergy between flying creatures and anthem effects creates a fast-paced and aggressive strategy."
