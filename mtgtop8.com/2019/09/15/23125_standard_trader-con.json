By playing aggressively and utilizing cards like Curious Obsession to draw cards and Rally of Wings to pump up our creatures, we can overwhelm our opponent with flying damage. Hanged Executioner and Dungeon Geists provide disruption against opposing threats, while Remorseful Cleric can disrupt graveyard strategies. The Azorius colors also provide access to counterspells like Unsummon to protect our creatures and maintain tempo."
