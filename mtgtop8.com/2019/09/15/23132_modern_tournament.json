By combining fast creatures like Lightning Skelemental and Ball Lightning with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Terminate, the goal is to put pressure on the opponent while also disrupting their hand and board state with cards like Davriel, Rogue Shadowmage and Wrench Mind. The inclusion of cards like The Rack and Dead of Winter adds additional ways to deal damage and control the opponent's resources, making this deck a versatile and formidable force in a Modern 1 vs 1 setting."
