The deck aims to disrupt opponents with Chalice of the Void and Thought-Knot Seer while using cards like Walking Ballista and Reality Smasher to apply pressure and quickly close out the game. Additionally, the deck includes cards like All Is Dust for board control and Expedition Map for consistency in finding necessary lands. Overall, the strategy revolves around synergy between Eldrazi creatures, mana acceleration, and disruption tools."
