By using cards like Spell Snare, Path to Exile, Cryptic Command, and Force of Negation, the deck aims to control the pace of the game and outvalue the opponent. The planeswalkers Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Teferi, Time Raveler, and Narset, Parter of Veils provide additional control and card advantage. The deck also includes some board wipes like Supreme Verdict for added control over the battlefield."
