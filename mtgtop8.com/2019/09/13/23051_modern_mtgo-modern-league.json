By utilizing the Dredge mechanic with cards like Stinkweed Imp and Life from the Loam, this deck can create a powerful engine that allows for repeated graveyard recursion and explosive turns. The combination of graveyard interaction and synergy between cards is what makes this deck a deadly threat in Modern 1 vs 1 matchups."
