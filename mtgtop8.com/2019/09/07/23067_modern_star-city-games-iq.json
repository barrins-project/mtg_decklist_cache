Aether Vial helps cheat creatures into play, while lands like Cavern of Souls ensure the spells can't be countered. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and maintain pressure throughout the game."

Snapcaster Mage provides added versatility by allowing the player to cast instants and sorceries from their graveyard. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent with card advantage from Jace, the Mind Sculptor and disruption from Teferi, Time Raveler. The mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility in color requirements."
