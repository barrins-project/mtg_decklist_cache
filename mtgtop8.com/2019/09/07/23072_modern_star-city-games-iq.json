The inclusion of cards like Boros Charm and Lightning Helix adds versatility and reach, allowing for different lines of play depending on the situation. The overall strategy is to be relentless and aggressive, aiming to win the game as quickly as possible."

By combining creatures like Devoted Druid and Vizier of Remedies with cards like Finale of Devastation and Eladamri's Call, the deck can quickly search for and play key pieces like Walking Ballista or Knight of Autumn. The inclusion of equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine gives the deck additional flexibility and potential win conditions. The deck's mana base is carefully constructed to support its creature-based strategy."
