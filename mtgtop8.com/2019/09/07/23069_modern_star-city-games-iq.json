The deck also includes cards like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to help find the UrzaTron lands quickly. The win conditions include powerful threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Wurmcoil Engine to close out the game. The deck's strength lies in its ability to quickly ramp up mana and overwhelm opponents with its powerful threats."
