It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while gradually gaining advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage, Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and Narset, Parter of Veils. The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Teferi, Time Raveler to further control the board and draw cards. With a strong mana base and a mix of removal and counter spells, UW Control seeks to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a long game."
