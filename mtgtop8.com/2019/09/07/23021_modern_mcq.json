            "notes": "The deck aims to quickly ramp up mana with cards like Farseek and Search for Tomorrow, allowing the player to cast Scapeshift and fetch Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle along with multiple mountains. By sacrificing lands and triggering Valakut's ability, the player can deal massive damage to the opponent, often winning the game in a single turn. Primeval Titan also helps accelerate the process by fetching additional lands. The deck heavily relies on assembling the Valakut combo as quickly as possible to overwhelm the opponent with direct damage."
