The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, protect its own threats, and eventually win through efficient card advantage and impactful threats like Teferi, Time Raveler, Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and Stoneforge Mystic fetching powerful equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine. The deck's win condition is to outvalue the opponent and grind out a victory through efficient plays and resource management."
