This allows for explosive early game plays with cards like Reckless Bushwhacker and Goblin Bushwhacker to overwhelm the opponent quickly. Additional support from cards like Goblin Chieftain and Goblin Grenade provide both buffs to the board and direct damage to close out games. Overall, the deck focuses on aggressive creature-based strategies to win the game as fast as possible."
