It also includes control elements like Ensnaring Bridge to limit the opponent's ability to attack. The deck also features strong threats like Karn, the Great Creator and Chandra, Torch of Defiance to quickly close out the game. By using cards like Gemstone Caverns and Simian Spirit Guide, the deck can ramp up its mana production early on to cast its powerful spells ahead of schedule."
