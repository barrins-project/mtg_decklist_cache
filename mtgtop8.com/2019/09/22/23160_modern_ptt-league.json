Thoughtseize and Mishra's Bauble provide disruption and card advantage, while cards like Temur Battle Rage and Mutagenic Growth help push through damage. The goal is to apply early pressure, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and finish the game quickly before they can stabilize. The deck relies on a balance of aggression and careful resource management to close out games efficiently."

By using cards like Retract and Grapeshot, the player can then bounce and/or deal damage to their opponent's creatures or directly to their opponent, ultimately leading to a win condition. Additionally, the deck includes some creature search and graveyard recursion for additional versatility."

The deck also includes protection spells like Spell Pierce and Apostle's Blessing to ensure your creatures can connect with your opponent. Teferi, Time Raveler is included to disrupt opponents' interaction, while Noble Hierarch helps accelerate your game plan. Overall, this deck aims to win the game through infect damage before the opponent can establish their board presence."
