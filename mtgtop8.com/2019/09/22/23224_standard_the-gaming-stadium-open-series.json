By playing efficient and cheap creatures like Brineborn Cutthroat, Merfolk Trickster, Pteramander, Siren Stormtamer, Spectral Sailor, and Tempest Djinn, the deck aims to apply pressure early on. To protect these creatures and ensure their effectiveness, the deck includes spells like Dive Down, Lookout's Dispersal, Opt, and Spell Pierce. Additionally, Curious Obsession allows for card draw and further boosts the strength of the creatures. Overall, this deck aims to establish early board presence and maintain tempo throughout the game."
