It also includes disruptive elements like Thought Erasure and Assassin's Trophy to control the opponent's resources. Yarok, the Desecrated enhances the effects of enter-the-battlefield triggers, while Jace, Wielder of Mysteries provides an alternative win condition. The mana base is designed to support the deck's diverse color requirements and maximize the potential of Field of the Dead to flood the board with zombie tokens. It aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent in a long game."
