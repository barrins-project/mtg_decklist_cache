            "notes": "This deck aims to control the game through a combination of disruption, removal, and powerful planeswalkers. By using counterspells, hand disruption, and removal spells, the deck can stop the opponent's threats while establishing its own board presence with creatures like Spellstutter Sprite and Bitterblossom. The deck also includes equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Fire and Ice to provide additional threats and card advantage. With powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Time Raveler, the deck can outvalue the opponent and grind out a win."
