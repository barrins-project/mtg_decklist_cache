By using cheap and direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, as well as efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and deplete the opponent's life total as fast as possible. This aggressive strategy is further supported by cards like Boros Charm and Lightning Helix, providing reach and versatility in finishing off the opponent."

The key strategy is to quickly get a hexproof creature on the battlefield and start stacking auras on it to create a massive threat that is difficult for the opponent to deal with effectively. The deck combines protection, evasion, and aggressive enchantments to quickly close out games."
