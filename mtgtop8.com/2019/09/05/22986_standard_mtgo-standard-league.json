Utilizing cards like Feather, the Redeemed and Tenth District Legionnaire to trigger multiple spells in a turn, this deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent and win the game as fast as possible. Reckless Rage and Shock provide removal options to clear the way for attacks, while Gird for Battle boosts the creatures' power for lethal damage."
