It aims to stabilize the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Batterskull while generating card advantage with Snapcaster Mage and Cryptic Command. The inclusion of Stoneforge Mystic allows for the efficient tutoring of equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine for additional value. The mana base supports the deck's control strategy by providing access to all necessary colors and utility lands like Celestial Colonnade and Field of Ruin."
