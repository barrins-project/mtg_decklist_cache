            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to utilize cheap removal and efficient creatures in order to control the board while applying pressure. By combining blue card draw and counterspells with red removal spells and white creatures, the deck aims to maintain card advantage and tempo advantage. The inclusion of artifact lands and Astrolabe allows for easy fixing of mana while providing additional value. The deck also has options for recursion and graveyard hate, adding versatility to its strategy. Ultimately, the deck seeks to out-value and out-tempo opponents to secure victory."
