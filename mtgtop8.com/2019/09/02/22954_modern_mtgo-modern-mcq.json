Prized Amalgam and Bloodghast provide additional value by returning to the battlefield from the graveyard. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of graveyard recursion and direct damage, creating a fast-paced and aggressive playstyle. The deck focuses on utilizing the graveyard as a resource and using it to win the game efficiently."
