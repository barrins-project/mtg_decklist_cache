The deck runs a variety of powerful control tools, such as Thought Erasure, Kaya's Wrath, and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, to maintain card advantage and stability. Additionally, Basilica Bell-Haunt and Oath of Kaya provide lifegain to stabilize against aggressive decks, while the inclusion of Bolas's Citadel offers a potential win condition through card advantage and life drain. Overall, the deck aims to outlast opponents and win through attrition."
