The deck also focuses on generating card advantage and value through cards like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Hydroid Krasis. Additionally, the deck includes Quasiduplicate for additional recursion and value, as well as Karn, the Great Creator for utility and shutting down artifact-based strategies. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outcontrol the opponent to secure victory."

By using cards like Marauding Raptor and Otepec Huntmaster to reduce the cost of dinosaurs, the deck can play multiple threats in a single turn. Cards like Rampaging Ferocidon and Shifting Ceratops provide additional value by disrupting the opponent's game plan and being difficult to deal with. The end goal is to close out the game quickly by attacking with big creatures like Charging Monstrosaur, Regisaur Alpha, and Ghalta, Primal Hunger while using removal spells like Lava Coil and Savage Stomp to clear a path."
