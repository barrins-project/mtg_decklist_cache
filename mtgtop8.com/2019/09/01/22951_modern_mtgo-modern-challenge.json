            "notes": "This deck focuses on using counterspells, removal, and card advantage to control the game and prevent the opponent from executing their game plan. It includes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, along with versatile creatures like Snapcaster Mage and Stoneforge Mystic. The deck aims to maintain board control with cards like Supreme Verdict and Path to Exile, while also generating card advantage with draw spells like Opt. The win condition is typically through incremental advantage and using equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine to close out the game."

By utilizing Eldrazi Temple and the Urza lands for mana acceleration, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with threats like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher. With the ability to tutor for specific artifacts using Expedition Map and Karn, the Great Creator, the deck is versatile and adaptable to different matchups, while also having access to powerful board wipes like All Is Dust to clear the way for its creatures to dominate the battlefield."

By using cards like Shriekhorn and Cathartic Reunion to quickly dredge through the deck, the goal is to bring back multiple creatures like Bloodghast and Narcomoeba from the graveyard to overwhelm the opponent. Conflagrate serves as a finisher by dealing damage equal to the number of cards in hand and can be discarded easily using Dredge cards. The deck aims to be fast and aggressive, putting pressure on the opponent early on."
