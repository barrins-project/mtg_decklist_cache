The deck also focuses on controlling the board with removal spells such as Fatal Push and Assassin's Trophy. Additionally, the deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to grind out incremental advantage. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive strategy while also providing utility with cards like Field of Ruin and Nurturing Peatland."
