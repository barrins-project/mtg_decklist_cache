The deck also has disruption elements like Pithing Needle and Nihil Spellbomb to handle opposing threats. Overall, the deck aims to slow down the game and grind out value through artifact synergies and control elements."

By combining direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Rift Bolt with fast creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, the deck can quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. The deck also includes cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel to punish opponents for casting spells, further increasing the pressure on them."

Gifts Ungiven is a powerful tool for finding the necessary cards to set up the combo, making the deck a formidable force in the Modern format."

Lingering Souls and Bloodghast provide recurring threats while Stoneforge Mystic fetches equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Fire and Ice for additional pressure. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar offers a versatile win condition. The deck aims to control the board and outvalue opponents while maintaining card advantage and resilience through recurring threats and life gain."
