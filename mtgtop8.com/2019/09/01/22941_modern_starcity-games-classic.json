With Mwonvuli Acid-Moss and Hour of Promise, you can disrupt your opponent's mana base and create additional threats with Field of the Dead.

            "notes": "The deck revolves around assembling the combo of Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle with Primeval Titan and Scapeshift to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent. By searching for lands and ramping up mana quickly, the deck aims to reach the critical mass of Mountains needed to trigger Valakut's ability multiple times in a single turn. Additionally, cards like Explore and Mwonvuli Acid-Moss help to accelerate the mana base and ensure the combo can be executed efficiently. The deck is designed to overwhelm the opponent with a sudden burst of damage from landfall triggers."
