The goal is to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react defensively, ultimately leading to a quick victory through aggressive and consistent burn damage."

With a mix of creature beats and control elements, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a steady and resilient onslaught of threats and disruption."
