            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to flood the board with cheap artifacts quickly, enabling aggressive plays with cards like Cranial Plating and Galvanic Blast to rapidly lower the opponent's life total. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures combined with burn spells, while also utilizing Throne of the God-Pharaoh for additional damage. The inclusion of Lupine Prototype provides a powerful beatstick that can be easily cast in this low-cost artifact-heavy deck. This deck thrives on speed, aggression, and efficient use of artifacts to dominate the battlefield."
