It aims to maintain a fast pace and pressure the opponent with aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage. The card draw and spell recursion provided by cards like Light Up the Stage and Finale of Promise help maintain momentum and keep the pressure on the opponent. This deck aims to win quickly and decisively through a combination of burn spells and recurring threats."
