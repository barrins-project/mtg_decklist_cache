The aim is to stall the opponent's advances while ramping up mana and eventually overwhelming them with an army of zombie tokens from Field of the Dead. Teferi, Time Raveler is used to disrupt the opponent's plays and protect key cards, while Hydroid Krasis provides a big threat that can gain life and draw cards. Overall, the strategy is to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
