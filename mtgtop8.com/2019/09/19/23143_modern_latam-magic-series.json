By using cards like Cryptic Command, Remand, and Spell Snare to disrupt the opponent's game plan, coupled with powerful threats like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Thing in the Ice, and Snapcaster Mage, this deck aims to maintain board control and out-value the opponent. Blood Moon can also serve as a disruptive element against multicolor decks. The deck's consistency is supported by card filtering effects like Serum Visions and Opt, allowing the player to find the right answers at the right time."
