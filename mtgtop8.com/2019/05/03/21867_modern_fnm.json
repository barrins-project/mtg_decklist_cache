It also includes disruption spells like Condescend and Remand to counter opponent's spells, along with removal like Path to Exile and Repeal. The deck also has ways to recur key artifacts with cards like Academy Ruins and Karn, the Great Creator, while also being able to lock down the opponent's board with cards like Mindslaver and Oblivion Stone."
