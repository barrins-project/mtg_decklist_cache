The strategy is to play aggressive creatures like Skymarcher Aspirant and Venerated Loxodon, and support them with cards like Benalish Marshal and History of Benalia to boost their power. Cards like Baffling End and Conclave Tribunal help control the opponent's board, while Ajani, Adversary of Tyrants provides additional creature support. The goal is to maintain pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The deck aims to control the board and prevent the opponent from executing their game plan by countering threats and removing key creatures. It also looks to generate card advantage through draw spells and planeswalker abilities. The win condition typically involves using powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria to generate card advantage and ultimately outvalue the opponent."
