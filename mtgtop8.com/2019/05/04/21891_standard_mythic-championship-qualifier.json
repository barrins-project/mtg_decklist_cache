This involves playing Wilderness Reclamation to untap all lands during the end step, allowing the player to have more mana available. Combining this with Nexus of Fate, the player can take additional turns, prolonging the game and gaining advantage. The deck also includes card draw and search tools like Chemister's Insight, Opt, and Search for Azcanta to ensure consistency. Tamiyo, Collector of Tales can help with card selection and recursion. Overall, the deck focuses on generating mana, taking extra turns, and controlling the game."

Additionally, cards like Skewer the Critics, Lightning Strike, and Wizard's Lightning provide reach to close out the game if the opponent manages to stabilize. Experimental Frenzy and Light Up the Stage help with card advantage and keeping the pressure on the opponent."
