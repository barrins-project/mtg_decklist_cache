The use of delve creatures like Gurmag Angler and Tasigur, the Golden Fang, along with cantrips like Thought Scour and Mishra's Bauble, allows for efficient resource management. The deck also includes some counter magic in Stubborn Denial to protect its threats. Overall, the deck aims to control the game early on and then close it out with a powerful Death's Shadow."

It also utilizes Karn, the Great Creator to lock opponents out of the game by shutting down key cards or combo pieces. The deck is designed to disrupt the opponent's game plan and win through incremental advantage and chip damage with flying tokens. It also has access to various sideboard options to further control the game and answer specific threats."
