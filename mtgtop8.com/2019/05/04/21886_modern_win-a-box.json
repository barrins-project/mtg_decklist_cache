Cards like Primeval Titan and Chandra, Torch of Defiance provide additional ways to ramp up mana and control the board, while cards like Lightning Bolt and Relic of Progenitus help to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck focuses on efficiently assembling the combo pieces and executing the win condition."
