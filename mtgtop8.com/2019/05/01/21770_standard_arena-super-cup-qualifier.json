The deck also utilizes card draw spells like Opt and Notion Rain to maintain card advantage and find key pieces of the deck. The goal is to outvalue the opponent and control the game until a win condition can be established."

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures such as Ghalta, Primal Hunger and Rekindling Phoenix, supported by ramp cards like Paradise Druid. Ilharg, the Raze-Boar allows for explosive plays by cheating out high-cost creatures, while God-Eternal Rhonas provides additional power and trample. The deck focuses on aggression and big creature plays to quickly close out games."
