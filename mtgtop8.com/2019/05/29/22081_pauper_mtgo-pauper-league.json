The deck focuses on efficiently answering threats and maintaining card advantage to outlast the opponent in a long game. It also utilizes flicker effects to reuse enter-the-battlefield abilities and generate additional value from creatures like Sea Gate Oracle. The mana base is built around ensuring consistent access to both blue and red mana sources."
