This mana is used to cast powerful colorless threats like Wurmcoil Engine, Walking Ballista, and Karn Liberated. The deck also includes control elements like Oblivion Stone and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to deal with opposing threats. The goal is to control the game by ramping up quickly and overpowering the opponent with big threats while disrupting their game plan."

By cycling through your deck with cards like Cathartic Reunion and Faithless Looting, you can trigger powerful effects like Creeping Chill and Life from the Loam. The deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with creatures and burn spells, while also controlling the board with cards like Darkblast and Blast Zone."
