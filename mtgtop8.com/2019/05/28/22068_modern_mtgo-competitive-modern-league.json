The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures equipped with powerful artifacts, such as Vault Skirge and Signal Pest. By utilizing cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum for ramp, and Experimental Frenzy for card advantage, this strategy aims to deal fast and consistent damage to the opponent in order to win the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
