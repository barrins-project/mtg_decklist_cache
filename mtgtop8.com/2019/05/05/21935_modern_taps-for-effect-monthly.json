Combining ramp creatures like Azusa, Lost but Seeking and Sakura-Tribe Scout with land searching cards like Ancient Stirrings and Tolaria West, the deck aims to assemble the necessary pieces for explosive turns. In addition, the deck includes utility lands and creatures like Trinket Mage to find specific answers or threats when needed. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with big threats and efficient mana usage."
