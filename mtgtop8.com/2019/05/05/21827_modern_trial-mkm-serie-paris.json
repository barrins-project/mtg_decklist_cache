Pyromancer Ascension helps to double up on spell effects, while Thing in the Ice provides a board presence that can potentially flip and clear the opponent's side of the field. Noxious Revival can be used to bring back key cards from the graveyard, ensuring a steady stream of threats and disruption for the opponent. This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of speed and resilience."
