It utilizes low-cost, efficient spells like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, Lava Spike, and Rift Bolt, along with creatures such as Eidolon of the Great Revel, Goblin Guide, and Monastery Swiftspear to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. The inclusion of cards like Searing Blaze, Skullcrack, and Lightning Helix help to control the board and prevent the opponent from gaining too much life. The key strategy is to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

By playing aggressive creatures like Glistener Elf and Blighted Agent, and using pump spells like Vines of Vastwood and Mutagenic Growth, the deck aims to deal 10 poison counters to the opponent as quickly as possible. The deck also includes cards like Street Wraith and Noble Hierarch to provide additional support and speed to the infect strategy, ensuring a swift and deadly victory."
