It also utilizes cards like Tamiyo, Collector of Tales and Search for Azcanta to help find key pieces of the combo and protect the player from disruption. The deck aims to stall the game with Root Snare and control cards like Negate until it can consistently take extra turns and overwhelm the opponent."
