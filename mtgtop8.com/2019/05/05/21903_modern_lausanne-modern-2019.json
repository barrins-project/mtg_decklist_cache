Spell Queller and Mausoleum Wanderer provide disruption for the opponent's spells, allowing the spirits to get in for damage. The deck also includes some utility creatures like Reflector Mage and Knight of Autumn to deal with problematic cards or situations."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing the graveyard as a resource to continuously bring back powerful creatures like Bloodghast, Stinkweed Imp, Narcomoeba, and Prized Amalgam. By dredging cards into the graveyard with cards like Faithless Looting and Life from the Loam, players can trigger powerful synergy effects like Creeping Chill. The goal is to quickly fill the graveyard, bring back multiple creatures at once, and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and resilience. The deck also includes various means of self-milling and generating advantage from the graveyard."

The deck also focuses on graveyard interaction with cards like Scavenging Ooze and Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet. Removal spells like Fatal Push and Assassin's Trophy help to clear the way for your creatures to attack, while planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil provide additional value and disruption. The deck aims to grind out wins through attrition and card advantage."
