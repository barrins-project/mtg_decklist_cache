Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Teferi, Time Raveler provide additional utility and disruption, while the inclusion of cards like Liliana, Dreadhorde General and Ugin, the Ineffable offer powerful late-game options. Overall, the deck seeks to maintain a proactive and versatile strategy that can adapt to different matchups."
