Cards like Rite of Consumption provide a direct way to deal damage to the opponent while Tragic Slip can help control the opponent's board. Lead the Stampede helps refill the hand with creatures to keep up the pressure. The Golgari Rot Farm and Ash Barrens provide mana fixing for the deck's dual-color requirements."
