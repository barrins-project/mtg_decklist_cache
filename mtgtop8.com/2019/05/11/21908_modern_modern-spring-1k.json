Additional control elements like Surgical Extraction and counterspells ensure the opponent can't disrupt the strategy. The deck also includes burn spells like Lightning Bolt for additional reach, making it a fast-paced and aggressive deck that can overwhelm opponents with a flurry of spells and creatures."

The inclusion of Aether Vial and utility lands like Mutavault and Oboro, Palace in the Clouds provide additional flexibility and resilience to the deck's game plan."

Cards like Reflector Mage and Deputy of Detention provide disruption to control the opponent's board, while Thalia, Guardian of Thraben slows down noncreature spells. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful army of human creatures, using synergies between various creatures like Thalia's Lieutenant and Champion of the Parish to create a strong and cohesive strategy."
