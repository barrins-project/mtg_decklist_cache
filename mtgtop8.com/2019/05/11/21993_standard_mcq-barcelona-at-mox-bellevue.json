By utilizing cards like Llanowar Elves and Growth-Chamber Guardian for ramp and card advantage, along with counterspells such as Frilled Mystic and Teferi, Time Raveler, the deck aims to control the board and maintain a strong presence. Key finishers like Hydroid Krasis and God-Eternal Oketra can quickly close out the game, while cards like Deputy of Detention provide additional removal options. Ultimately, the deck seeks to establish dominance and win through aggressive plays and strategic decision-making."
