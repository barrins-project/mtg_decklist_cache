By utilizing cards like Aether Vial and Noble Hierarch to quickly deploy creatures, along with disruptive cards like Meddling Mage and Reflector Mage to control the opponent's game plan, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Thalia's Lieutenant provide additional buffs to the creatures, making them even more threatening. The combination of speed, disruption, and synergy among the human creatures is key to the deck's success in the Modern format."

Cards like Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer help reduce the cost of spells, while Past in Flames allows for crucial spells to be recast from the graveyard. Gifts Ungiven is used to search for key combo pieces, creating a highly efficient and deadly storm combo."
