This is achieved through cards like Saproling Migration, Legion's Landing, and March of the Multitudes, which generate multiple tokens. The deck also utilizes powerful creatures and planeswalkers like Ajani, the Greathearted, Huatli's Raptor, and Trostani Discordant to further strengthen the board. Additionally, the deck includes control elements like Conclave Tribunal and Tithe Taker to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The goal is to apply constant pressure and maintain a strong presence on the battlefield."
