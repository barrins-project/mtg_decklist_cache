By playing aggressively and dealing damage early on, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent and finish the game quickly. The synergy between cheap creatures and powerful burn spells allows for a fast-paced and explosive playstyle. The inclusion of card draw and creature pump effects helps to maintain momentum and push for a decisive victory. The strategy revolves around efficient use of resources and strategic decision-making to maximize damage output and close out games swiftly."
