The deck aims to stall the game until it can play powerful finishers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Crackling Drake. Card advantage and card selection are key components of the deck, allowing the player to outvalue the opponent over time. The combination of counter spells, removal, and powerful planeswalkers makes it difficult for the opponent to establish a strong board presence."
