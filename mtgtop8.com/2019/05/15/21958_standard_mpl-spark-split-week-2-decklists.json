By quickly building up a board presence with cards like Legion's Landing and Venerated Loxodon, the deck aims to apply pressure early in the game and maintain control with cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Gideon Blackblade. The inclusion of removal spells like Conclave Tribunal ensures that the opponent's threats are dealt with efficiently, allowing the weenie white creatures to keep attacking and chip away at the opponent's life total."
