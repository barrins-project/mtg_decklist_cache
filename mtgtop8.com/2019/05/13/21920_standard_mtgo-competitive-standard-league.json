With cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Saheeli, Sublime Artificer providing card advantage and creating tokens, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent. The inclusion of Crackling Drake and God-Eternal Kefnet as win conditions ensures that the deck has multiple ways to close out the game. By maintaining board control and disrupting the opponent's game plan, this deck aims to grind out victories through careful planning and resource management."
