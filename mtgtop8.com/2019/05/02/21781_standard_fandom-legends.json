Tamiyo, Collector of Tales helps with card selection and recursion, while Search for Azcanta and Chemister's Insight provide card advantage. Root Snare and Blast Zone help with stalling the game until the combo can be set up, and Memorial to Genius provides additional card draw. Overall, the key concept revolves around chaining extra turns and overwhelming the opponent with card advantage and tempo."

The deck focuses on playing powerful creatures quickly and efficiently, taking advantage of cards like Rhythm of the Wild and Domri, Anarch of Bolas to boost their abilities. With a mix of ramp, haste, and card draw, the deck aims to pressure the opponent early on and finish them off with big threats like End-Raze Forerunners and Ilharg, the Raze-Boar. The goal is to maintain tempo and put the opponent on the defensive, ultimately securing victory through overwhelming force."

The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by playing a long game and eventually overwhelming them with powerful planeswalkers like Liliana, Dreadhorde General. The inclusion of counter spells and additional removal options provides a way to deal with threats that slip through the initial disruption plan. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game and grinding out a win through attrition."
