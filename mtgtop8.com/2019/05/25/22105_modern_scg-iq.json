Saheeli, Sublime Artificer provides additional value by creating tokens with each noncreature spell cast. The deck focuses on speed, consistency, and utilizing the graveyard as a resource for multiple win conditions."

By using removal spells such as Fatal Push and Path to Exile, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while utilizing card advantage with Snapcaster Mage and efficient mana fixing with fetch lands. This deck excels at creating a powerful late-game board state and outvaluing the opponent through card advantage and control elements."

It includes a mix of cantrips, cheap removal, and Pyromancer Ascension to double up on spells and create powerful board states. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain a high level of aggression throughout the game using efficient spells and creatures. Additionally, it utilizes Snapcaster Mage to recur important spells and maintain card advantage."
