            "notes": "The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly using cards like Farseek and Sakura-Tribe Elder to cast Primeval Titan and Scapeshift to search for Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and mountains. The main goal is to get enough lands in play to activate Valakut's ability when mountains enter the battlefield, dealing direct damage to the opponent. Cards like Mwonvuli Acid-Moss and Cinder Glade help accelerate this process, while Summoner's Pact can search for Primeval Titan for additional land ramp. The deck aims to win swiftly by dealing massive amounts of damage in a single turn with Valakut triggers."
