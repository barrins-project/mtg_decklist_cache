By maximizing the number of early-game creatures like Adanto Vanguard and Skymarcher Aspirant, along with buffs from cards such as Benalish Marshal and Venerated Loxodon, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and continue applying pressure throughout the game. With the addition of powerful support cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and History of Benalia, this deck is designed to establish control early and dictate the pace of the match."
