The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and maintain a fast pace to finish the game quickly. By using a combination of burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Boros Charm, along with aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck looks to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. Additionally, cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish the opponent for playing spells, further adding to the aggressive strategy."

The deck also includes removal spells like Oblivion Stone and Walking Ballista to control the board. The goal is to outvalue the opponent and win through incremental advantage generated by the powerful cards in the deck."
