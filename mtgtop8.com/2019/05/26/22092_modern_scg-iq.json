The use of cards like Faithless Looting and Finale of Promise help facilitate this strategy by filling the graveyard and enabling the recurring presence of Arclight Phoenix. It's all about speed, aggression, and maximizing the value of spell-casting."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly assemble an Infect win condition by playing creatures with infect, such as Glistener Elf and Blighted Agent, and boosting them with pump spells like Mutagenic Growth and Might of Old Krosa. The deck also includes protection spells like Blossoming Defense and Apostle's Blessing to ensure the infect creatures can deal damage uncontested. The use of lands like Inkmoth Nexus and Noble Hierarch further enhance the deck's ability to quickly attack with infect creatures and win the game before the opponent can mount a defense."
