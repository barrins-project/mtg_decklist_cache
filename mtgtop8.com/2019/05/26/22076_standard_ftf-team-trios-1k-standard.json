Goblin Electromancer helps reduce the cost of spells, allowing for faster plays. Saheeli, Sublime Artificer adds tokens to the field, providing additional aggression. The deck aims to apply pressure early, utilizing cheap removal spells like Shock and Lava Coil to clear the path for its creatures to attack and win the game swiftly."
