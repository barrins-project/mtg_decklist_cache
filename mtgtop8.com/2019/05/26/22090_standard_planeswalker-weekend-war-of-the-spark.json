The inclusion of disruptive spells like Spell Pierce and The Elderspell adds control elements to protect your threats and further disrupt your opponent's game plan. With a mix of efficient removal, card advantage engines like Kasmina, Enigmatic Mentor, and a solid mana base, this deck aims to apply pressure and close out games quickly."
