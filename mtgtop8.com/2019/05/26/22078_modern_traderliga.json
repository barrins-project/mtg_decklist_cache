The deck also includes disruptive cards like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter to disrupt the opponent's game plan. With Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play and creatures with evasion like Mantis Rider, this deck aims to quickly apply pressure to the opponent and overwhelm them before they can stabilize. The mana base is set up to support the Human tribal theme, allowing for consistent and explosive plays."
