It aims to stall the game with board wipes like Kaya's Wrath and Cry of the Carnarium, while slowly building up card advantage with Teferi, Planeswalkers, and Search for Azcanta. The combination of removal spells, counterspells, and powerful planeswalkers allows the deck to dictate the pace of the game and outvalue opponents in the long run. It excels at controlling the board and disrupting opponent's plans while maintaining a stable mana base for consistency."

With strong ramp cards like Paradise Druid and Incubation Druid, you can quickly generate the mana needed to cast your high-cost spells. This deck focuses on controlling the game until you can establish dominance and secure the win."
