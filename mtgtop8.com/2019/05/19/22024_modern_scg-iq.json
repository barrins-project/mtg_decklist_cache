The deck aims to deal damage early and often, utilizing cards like Lava Spike, Rift Bolt, and Searing Blaze to finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. The deck also includes ways to refill its hand and maintain pressure with cards like Light Up the Stage. The key to success with this deck is to maintain a relentless onslaught of damage and aggression."

The inclusion of Snapcaster Mage and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy allows for recursion of key spells, while Mishra's Bauble and Though Scour aid in digging for more threats and answers.

The deck also focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Archive Trap and Ashiok, Dream Render, while controlling the board with cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Fatal Push. By efficiently milling the opponent and disrupting their strategies, this deck aims to win the game through deck depletion rather than traditional combat damage."
