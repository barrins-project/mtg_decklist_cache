It focuses on getting Arclight Phoenix into play by casting multiple spells in a turn, while also utilizing Thing in the Ice and Crackling Drake as additional threats. The deck's strategy is to apply early pressure with cheap spells and creatures, using burn spells as removal and finishing the game with powerful flying threats. The key concept is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and value from graveyard recursion."

With disruptive elements like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter, the deck can disrupt the opponent's game plan while continuing to apply pressure. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy by providing consistent access to colored sources for the tribal creatures."

By assembling a board full of creatures and using cards like Throne of Geth and Walking Ballista, the deck can quickly overwhelm opponents with a large number of powerful creatures. The deck also includes cards like Mox Opal and Ancient Stirrings to help ramp up and find key pieces of the combo. Overall, the key concept of the deck is to flood the board with counters and win through aggressive creature attacks."
