It uses cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, Wielder of Mysteries for card advantage, along with counterspells like Remand and Cryptic Command to disrupt the opponent's plays. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Abrade to deal with threats, as well as a toolbox of versatile cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Mirror of Fate. Additionally, cards like Blood Moon and Field of Ruin help to disrupt the opponent's mana base."
