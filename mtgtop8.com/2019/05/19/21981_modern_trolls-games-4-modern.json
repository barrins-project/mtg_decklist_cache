The deck's win condition comes from powerful threats like Hazoret the Fervent and aggressive token generators like Goblin Rabblemaster. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with its big red spells and creatures."

It aims to control the board state and tempo with cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Cryptic Command while also providing alternate win conditions with Celestial Colonnade. The deck also includes a variety of utility lands like Field of Ruin and Blast Zone to deal with problematic permanents from the opponent."
