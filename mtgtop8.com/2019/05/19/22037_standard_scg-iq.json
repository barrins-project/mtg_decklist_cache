Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Wildgrowth Walker and Sorin, Vengeful Bloodlord provide lifegain and board presence to outlast aggressive strategies. The mana base is designed to support the multicolored cards and ensure consistent access to the necessary colors for the deck to function effectively."
