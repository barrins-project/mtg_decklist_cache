It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, maintain board control, and eventually win the game by using powerful spells like Terminus and Cryptic Command. The deck also includes cards like Relic of Progenitus to disrupt graveyard strategies and Settle the Wreckage as a board wipe. The win condition is typically achieved through combat damage with creatures like Celestial Colonnade or by accumulating card advantage with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor."
