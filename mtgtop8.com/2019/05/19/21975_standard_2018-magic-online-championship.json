The deck also includes removal options like Conclave Tribunal to deal with threats from the opponent.

By playing cheap creatures like Viashino Pyromancer and Ghitu Lavarunner, along with powerful burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Experimental Frenzy and Chandra, Fire Artisan provide additional card advantage and late-game support to keep up the pressure. Overall, the deck aims to win the game as fast as possible through a combination of creature attacks and direct damage spells."
