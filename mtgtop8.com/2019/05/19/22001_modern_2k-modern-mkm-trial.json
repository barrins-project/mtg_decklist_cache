The inclusion of cards like Animation Module and Throne of Geth provide additional ways to generate value from the +1/+1 counters, creating a potent Aggro strategy that can quickly snowball out of control."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on playing a fast-paced game by curving out with aggressive Human creatures like Champion of the Parish, Thalia's Lieutenant, and Mantis Rider. The deck also disrupts the opponent's game plan with cards like Meddling Mage and Reflector Mage. The mana base is designed to support the Human tribal theme with cards like Cavern of Souls and Unclaimed Territory. The goal is to establish a board presence quickly and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
