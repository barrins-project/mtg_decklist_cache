It includes cards like Crop Rotation and Sylvan Scrying to search for the combo pieces, along with disruption tools like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach to control the opponent's hand. Additionally, there are utility cards like Abrupt Decay and Sylvan Safekeeper for protection. The deck aims to win through the powerful combo while disrupting the opponent's game plan with discard and removal spells."

True-Name Nemesis provides a difficult-to-answer threat, while cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor offer card advantage and flexibility. The mana base is optimized for consistency with dual lands and fetchlands, and Back to Basics can help shut down opposing decks reliant on nonbasic lands. The overall strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while establishing a strong board presence."
