This mana is then used to cast powerful spells such as Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Emrakul, the Promised End. The deck aims to control the game by removing threats with cards like Oblivion Stone and countering opposing spells with counter magic while setting up game-winning threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and World Breaker. The deck also includes ways to tutor for key pieces and filter through the deck for consistency."

It utilizes various means of control, like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Oblivion Stone, to dominate the board and disrupt opponents' strategies. The deck also includes powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to close out the game. Lastly, it includes cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to consistently find and tutor for the Tron lands needed for its strategy."
