            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing powerful planeswalkers and control spells to dominate the game. By utilizing cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Narset, Parter of Veils, the deck aims to control the opponent's resources and limit their options. The inclusion of board wipes like Kaya's Wrath and powerful removal spells like Tyrant's Scorn helps to maintain board control. Additionally, cards like The Elderspell can help to quickly build up powerful planeswalkers while Yawgmoth's Vile Offering allows for strong recursion and value generation. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue opponents and control the game state."
