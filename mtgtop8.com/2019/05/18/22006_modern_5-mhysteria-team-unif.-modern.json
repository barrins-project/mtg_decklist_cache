By utilizing cards like Shriekhorn and Life from the Loam, the player can constantly dredge cards back from the graveyard and put pressure on the opponent with a steady stream of creatures. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and consistent graveyard-based combo, while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Conflagrate and Creeping Chill."
