Primeval Titan and Sakura-Tribe Elder help accelerate the mana ramping process, while Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides additional value and removal. The deck also includes some control elements like Lightning Bolt and Sweltering Suns to help survive until the combo can be assembled. Overall, the goal is to win the game through a powerful combo finish."
