By quickly establishing a wide board presence and utilizing cards like Benalish Marshal and Venerated Loxodon, the deck aims to apply pressure and force the opponent to react before they have a chance to stabilize. This strategy relies on efficient creature drops and synergies within the white weenie archetype to secure victories through fast, aggressive gameplay."

It also utilizes card advantage engines like Narset, Parter of Veils and Search for Azcanta to consistently draw into more answers. The win condition is typically through grinding out the opponent's resources and eventually overwhelming them with powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. Overall, the deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a dominant position and secure victory through attrition."
