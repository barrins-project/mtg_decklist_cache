With a mostly creature-focused strategy, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with early damage and finish them off with burn spells. Key cards like Viashino Pyromancer, Goblin Chainwhirler, and Chandra, Fire Artisan provide additional damage and card advantage to maintain pressure on the opponent. Lightning Strike and Shock offer direct damage spells to help control the board and push through the opponent's defenses."
