Mox Opal, Springleaf Drum, and Spire of Industry help ramp out additional artifacts for increased aggression. Steel Overseer and Karn, Scion of Urza provide additional support by buffing creatures and generating card advantage. The synergy between artifacts and creatures allows for explosive turns and overwhelming board presence, making it a formidable Aggro - Affinity deck in the Modern format."
