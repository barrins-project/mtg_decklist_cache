Additionally, the deck has some card advantage and value engines with cards like Liliana of the Veil and Bloodbraid Elf."

The deck also includes protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense to protect their creatures and secure the victory. The land base is streamlined to ensure the deck can consistently hit its creature and spell drops on curve."
