The strategy revolves around playing small, efficient creatures like Adanto Vanguard, Snubhorn Sentry, and Skymarcher Aspirant, while also utilizing cards like Legion's Landing and Venerated Loxodon to generate value and buff the team. The inclusion of cards like Conclave Tribunal and Benalish Marshal provide removal and additional anthem effects to enhance the board presence. Overall, this deck aims to establish dominance early on and maintain pressure throughout the game."

Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Ugin, the Ineffable provide additional card advantage and removal options. The deck also includes lifegain and value-generating creatures like Basilica Bell-Haunt and Elite Guardmage to stay ahead on the board. The goal is to pressure the opponent early and maintain control of the game with a mix of creatures and spells."
