By utilizing cards like Street Wraith and Mishra's Bauble to lower your own life total, you can make Death's Shadow a massive creature early in the game. The deck also includes aggressive creatures like Dreadhorde Arcanist and Monastery Swiftspear to apply pressure to the opponent, while spells like Lightning Bolt and Temur Battle Rage provide additional reach and damage. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with fast, powerful threats and efficient removal spells."

The goal is to effectively reanimate these creatures and overwhelm the opponent with their sheer power and abilities.

The deck includes multiple ways to generate card advantage and refill the board, ensuring a consistent flow of threats. By utilizing cards like Collected Company and Lead the Stampede, the deck can quickly rebuild after a board wipe or disruption, keeping the pressure on the opponent. The addition of Cavern of Souls and diverse land base enhances the deck's consistency and resiliency."
