The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Cabal Therapy and Unmask while assembling the combo pieces needed to win the game quickly."

The deck aims to control the board early on with cheap interaction, then close out the game quickly with threats like Delver of Secrets and Gurmag Angler. Reanimate is included as a surprise finisher, while cards like Brainstorm and Preordain provide card selection to keep the deck running smoothly."
