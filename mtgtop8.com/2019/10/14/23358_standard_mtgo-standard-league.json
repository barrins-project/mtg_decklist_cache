By utilizing cards like Improbable Alliance, Dreadhorde Arcanist, and Irencrag Pyromancer, the deck aims to apply pressure early in the game and maintain a steady stream of threats. The inclusion of cards like Kasmina, Enigmatic Mentor and The Royal Scions provides additional utility and card filtering to keep the aggression going. Overall, the deck is designed to overwhelm the opponent with a fast-paced, aggressive strategy."
