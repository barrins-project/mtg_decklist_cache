The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Vivien, Arkbow Ranger to further enhance its board presence. Additionally, cards like The Great Henge and Find / Finality provide card advantage and resilience to removal spells. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of fast aggression and card advantage, making it a potent threat in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
