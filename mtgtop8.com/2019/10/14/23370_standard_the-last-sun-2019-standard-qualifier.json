The deck also incorporates planeswalkers like The Royal Scions and Domri, Anarch of Bolas to provide additional versatility and threats. With a mix of creature ramp, removal spells, and card advantage engines, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of speed and power while maintaining a strong board presence."
