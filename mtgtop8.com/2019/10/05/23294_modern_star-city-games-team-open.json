Cards like Azusa, Lost but Seeking and Sakura-Tribe Scout help accelerate the process by allowing multiple land drops per turn. With access to lands like Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion and Slayers' Stronghold, the deck can easily close out games with a hasty Primeval Titan. The deck's consistency is further enhanced by multiple tutors and card draw spells."

The combination of Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum allows for explosive starts and the ability to cast multiple spells in a turn. Steel Overseer provides a way to pump up the team of artifact creatures, while Arcbound Ravager and Etched Champion offer versatility and protection.

By utilizing cards like Scapeshift and Primeval Titan to fetch Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and mountains, the player can trigger Valakut's ability multiple times in a single turn, dealing lethal damage to their opponent. The deck also includes land destruction spells like Mwonvuli Acid-Moss to disrupt the opponent's mana base and keep them from being able to mount a defense."
