The synergy between creatures with flash, counterspells, and card advantage from cards like Once Upon a Time allows the deck to adapt to different situations and disrupt the opponent's game plan while building a strong board presence."

The deck also utilizes Fae of Wishes and Drawn from Dreams to search for specific answers or threats when needed.
