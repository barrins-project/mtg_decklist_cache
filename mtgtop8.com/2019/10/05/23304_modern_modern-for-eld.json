By using cards like Rancor, Ethereal Armor, and Daybreak Coronet, the deck can quickly pump up its creatures to deal large amounts of damage. Additionally, Leyline of Sanctity provides protection from targeted removal spells, while Heroic Intervention can save creatures from board wipes. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with large, hexproof creatures before they have a chance to respond effectively."
