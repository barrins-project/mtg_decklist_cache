This mana is then used to cast powerful colorless threats like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Emrakul, the Promised End. The deck also includes various ways to find and tutor for the UrzaTron pieces such as Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying. Additionally, it has removal like Oblivion Stone and Walking Ballista to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
