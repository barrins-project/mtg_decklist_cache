The creatures in the deck, such as Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, are swift and aggressive, putting pressure on the opponent early in the game. The goal is to keep the opponent on the back foot by constantly dealing damage and preventing them from stabilizing. The deck aims to win the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
