The deck also features a strong counter package with cards like Force of Will and Daze to protect its threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. By combining a mix of creatures, counterspells, and burn spells, the deck aims to close out the game quickly and efficiently before the opponent can stabilize or establish their own game plan."
