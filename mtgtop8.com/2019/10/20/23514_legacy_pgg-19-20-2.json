By efficiently managing threats with cards like Swords to Plowshares and Force of Will, the deck aims to maintain a stable board state until it can win through cards like Monastery Mentor or burn spells like Lightning Bolt. The deck leverages its flexibility and power to outlast opponents and secure victory through superior card advantage and control."
