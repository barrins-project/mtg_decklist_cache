It aims to protect key threats and maintain card advantage through efficient card draw and recursion with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Snapcaster Mage. The land base includes utility lands like Field of Ruin and Celestial Colonnade to deal with problematic lands, while also providing consistent mana for the spells. This deck excels at managing the board state, out-valuing the opponent, and ultimately grinding out wins through superior card advantage and control."
