It includes a mix of utility lands and ramp spells to enable the combo, with a backup plan of utilizing lands like Field of the Dead for additional value. The main win condition is through the Titan attacking multiple times in a turn, often fetching utility lands like Slayers' Stronghold or Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion to deal lethal damage swiftly. The deck prioritizes setting up the combo while controlling the board and ensuring consistency through card selection spells."
