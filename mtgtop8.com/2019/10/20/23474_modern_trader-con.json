The inclusion of cards like Skullcrack and Boros Charm helps to bypass opponent's defensive strategies, while cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish opponents for playing spells, giving the deck a strong advantage in a fast-paced matchup."

With the help of pump spells like Scale Up, Might of Old Krosa, and Mutagenic Growth, as well as protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense, you aim to overwhelm your opponent with lethal poison damage before they can mount an effective defense. The deck also includes some disruption in the form of Spell Pierce and Dismember to help protect your combo pieces and clear the way for victory."
