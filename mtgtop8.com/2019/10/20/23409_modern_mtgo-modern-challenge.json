The inclusion of cards like Boros Charm and Lightning Helix adds flexibility and reach to finish off opponents. The mana base is streamlined to ensure consistent access to the necessary colors for spells."

It also includes powerful finishers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to close out the game once it has established control."

The deck also includes draw spells like Visions of Beyond to keep the hand full for additional mill power. The goal is to quickly mill the opponent's deck, activating Archive Trap for massive mill effects and ultimately winning the game through deck out."
