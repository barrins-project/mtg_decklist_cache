The key concept is to set up a powerful combo by combining bounce lands with Amulet of Vigor, allowing for explosive turns where you can put multiple lands into play and search for key land cards like Field of the Dead or utility lands using Primeval Titan. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a large board presence and powerful interactions while utilizing the deck's unique land mechanics to gain an advantage."
