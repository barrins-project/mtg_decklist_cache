By utilizing cards like Ethereal Armor, Ancestral Mask, and Armadillo Cloak, the deck aims to create powerful creatures that can deal a significant amount of damage to the opponent quickly. The goal is to establish an aggressive board presence early in the game and maintain pressure on the opponent, using cards like Slippery Bogle and Gladecover Scout to protect key creatures and ensure they can continue to attack effectively."
