Cards like Vampire Hexmage and Elvish Reclaimer can help search for the combo pieces or speed up the process. The deck also includes disruption like Thoughtseize, Duress, and Abrupt Decay to protect the combo and interact with the opponent's game plan. Additionally, lands like Wasteland and Karakas can disrupt the opponent's mana base or key threats. The deck aims to win by executing the combo while controlling the game with disruption."
