Karn, the Great Creator serves as a versatile toolbox and disruption piece while cards like Pact of Negation provide protection. The goal is to assemble the pieces needed for the combo quickly and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to respond."

The deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total before they have a chance to establish a strong board presence or stabilize. By combining powerful creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide with a plethora of burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, the deck can deal a consistent stream of damage and apply pressure throughout the game. The inclusion of powerful cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Boros Charm further enhances the deck's ability to close out games quickly."
