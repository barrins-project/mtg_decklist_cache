The deck includes cards like Chalice of the Void and Karn, the Great Creator to disrupt opponent's strategies, while Eldrazi creatures such as Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher put pressure on the opponent. Additionally, cards like Ugin, the Ineffable and All Is Dust provide board control and removal options. The deck aims to establish board dominance early and maintain pressure throughout the game."

By utilizing powerful cards like Liliana, the Last Hope and Gravecrawler, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan with cards like Tidehollow Sculler and Fatal Push. The inclusion of various lords like Death Baron and Lord of the Accursed further enhances the strength of the creature base, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize and turn the game in their favor. Overall, the deck's strategy revolves around aggressive plays and efficient removal to secure victory."
