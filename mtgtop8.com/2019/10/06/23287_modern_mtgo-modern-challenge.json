The deck aims to control the board with cards like Searing Blaze and Eidolon of the Great Revel, and maintain pressure with efficient creatures and direct damage spells. The mana base is designed to support this aggressive strategy with a mix of fetch lands and shock lands for consistent casting of spells."
