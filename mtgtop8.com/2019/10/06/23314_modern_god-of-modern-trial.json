By using cards like Devoted Druid and Vizier of Remedies, the deck can generate infinite mana to then search for and play cards like Walking Ballista for a game-winning combo. Cards like Collected Company and Chord of Calling help to find the necessary pieces quickly, while cards like Giver of Runes and Knight of Autumn provide protection and disruption. The deck aims to efficiently assemble its combo while also maintaining a solid board presence with various utility creatures."
