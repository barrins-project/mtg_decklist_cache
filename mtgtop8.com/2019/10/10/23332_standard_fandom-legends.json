The addition of Agent of Treachery and Kenrith, the Returned King provide additional ways to control the game."

It utilizes cards like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Oko, Thief of Crowns to control the board while applying pressure with aggressive creatures like Questing Beast and Voracious Hydra. The Great Henge provides card draw and a boost to creatures, while Mass Manipulation can swing the game in your favor by stealing opponent's creatures. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient threats and powerful spells."
