The key strategy is to efficiently play creatures with powerful effects from Adventure cards like Beanstalk Giant and Rimrock Knight, while also maintaining card advantage through the Edgewall Innkeeper. This allows the deck to overwhelm opponents with a mix of aggressive creatures and removal spells like Murderous Rider and Bonecrusher Giant, ultimately aiming to close out the game quickly with a strong board presence."

It aims to control the game with cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Time Wipe while using Once Upon a Time to find key pieces. The deck also utilizes Field of the Dead to generate an army of Zombie tokens. By establishing control of the game early and overwhelming the opponent with powerful creatures, this deck seeks to outlast and outvalue its opponents in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
