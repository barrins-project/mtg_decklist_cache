The inclusion of Snapcaster Mage and Torrential Gearhulk allows for additional value and flexibility in casting spells from the graveyard. Additionally, the deck's mana base is carefully constructed to support its color requirements and maximize utility lands like Mystic Sanctuary and Field of the Dead."

The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Spell Queller, while also efficiently dealing with threats using Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile. Geist of Saint Traft and Stoneforge Mystic provide strong threats that can quickly end the game if left unchecked. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by generating card advantage with Snapcaster Mage and Opt, while also having access to powerful finishers like Batterskull and Sword of Fire and Ice. This deck excels at controlling the board and maintaining a strong presence to secure a victory."

The deck utilizes creatures like Birds of Paradise and Noble Hierarch to ramp into its combo pieces while also providing protection with Giver of Runes. Collected Company and Chord of Calling help search for key creatures, creating a versatile toolbox strategy. Eternal Witness and Shalai, Voice of Plenty offer recursion and protection respectively, making this deck a resilient and adaptable combo force."
