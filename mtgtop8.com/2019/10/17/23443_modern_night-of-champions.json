The main strategy is to ramp up your mana quickly using cards like Farseek and Sakura-Tribe Elder, and then use cards like Scapeshift to search for and put multiple Valakuts onto the battlefield at once. Primeval Titan is a key card to search for more Mountains and Valakuts, while Mwonvuli Acid-Moss can disrupt your opponent's mana base. The deck aims to win quickly by overwhelming the opponent with direct damage from Valakut triggers."

Key cards like Street Wraith, Mishra's Bauble, and Thought Scour help to enable this strategy by allowing the player to cycle through their deck quickly. With plenty of disruption tools like Thoughtseize and Stubborn Denial, as well as removal in Fatal Push and Dismember, this deck aims to be fast and aggressive while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
