The deck also includes control elements like Fatal Push and Drown in the Loch to disrupt the opponent's strategy while protecting the combo pieces. The inclusion of Visions of Beyond allows for card draw once the opponent's library starts to dwindle. Overall, the deck aims to mill the opponent out as quickly and efficiently as possible while controlling the game state."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to disrupt your opponent's resources while deploying powerful threats quickly. By using cards like Leonin Arbiter and Ghost Quarter to disrupt your opponent's mana base, Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to increase the cost of their spells, and Chalice of the Void to lock them out of certain mana costs, you can control the game and protect your own game plan. Meanwhile, Eldrazi creatures like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher provide powerful beatdown potential to close out the game quickly. This deck focuses on aggressive plays and efficient disruption to overwhelm opponents."
