The deck also maximizes its mana base with a mix of fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistency and flexibility in casting its spells."

Ensnaring Bridge and Trinisphere help to stall the opponent's game plan while cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Karn, the Great Creator provide additional value and utility. The deck aims to quickly lock down the game and overwhelm the opponent with its disruptive elements and efficient threats."
