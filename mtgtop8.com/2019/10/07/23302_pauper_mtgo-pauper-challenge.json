By incorporating snow lands and artifacts like Arcum's Astrolabe, the deck aims to consistently hit its mana requirements and generate card advantage. Additionally, the deck includes recursion through Archaeomancer and Ephemerate to maximize the value of key spells and creatures. The Jeskai color combination allows for flexibility in dealing with various threats while maintaining a proactive game plan."
