This allows the player to repeatedly exile and return permanents to the battlefield, generating values and potentially overwhelming the opponent with a powerful board presence. The deck also includes supporting cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Teferi, Time Raveler to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect the combo pieces. The inclusion of ramp creatures and card draw spells help to ensure the combo can be assembled quickly and efficiently."
