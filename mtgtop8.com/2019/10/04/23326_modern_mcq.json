By utilizing cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage to deal damage early on, alongside powerful spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Bedlam Reveler and Light Up the Stage helps to maintain card advantage, ensuring a steady stream of threats to keep the pressure on the opponent."

By utilizing cards like Cryptic Command, Snapcaster Mage, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, you can control the pace of the game and outvalue your opponent in the long run. With a mix of versatile threats like Tasigur, the Golden Fang and Brazen Borrower, you can also apply pressure when needed. The mana base is built to support the deck's three-color identity while also providing flexibility with land destruction options like Field of Ruin."

This allows the player to play powerful colorless threats like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, Karn Liberated, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The deck also includes control elements like Oblivion Stone and Karn, the Great Creator to deal with opponents' threats. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Thragtusk and Wurmcoil Engine for stabilization and life gain against aggressive strategies."
