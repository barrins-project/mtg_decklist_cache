By constantly disrupting the opponent with counterspells like Daze, Force of Will, and Spell Pierce, while also removing threats with Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to take advantage of its opponent's misplays. Cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Wrenn and Six provide additional value and versatility, allowing the deck to adapt to various situations. The mana base is streamlined to support the deck's aggressive tempo game plan."
