By combining direct damage spells with creatures that can ping the opponent for damage each turn, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react quickly or risk losing the game. The deck's strategy is to build up a quick board presence and maintain a steady stream of damage to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
