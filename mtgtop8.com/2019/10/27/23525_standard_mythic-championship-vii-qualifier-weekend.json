The adventure creatures provide additional utility and the Lovestruck Beast can create a 1/1 token to go wide. The deck can also generate large amounts of tokens with March of the Multitudes and can disrupt opponents' game plan with Conclave Tribunal. Overall, the deck seeks to overwhelm opponents with a fast and aggressive strategy while maintaining a level of versatility and control."
