By utilizing cards like Faeries Miscreant and Ninja of the Deep Hours, the deck aims to maintain card advantage and tempo advantage throughout the game. The inclusion of cheap counterspells like Counterspell and Force Spike allows the deck to protect its threats and prevent the opponent from developing their board. Mystic Sanctuary serves as a late-game value engine by allowing the player to recur key spells from the graveyard."
