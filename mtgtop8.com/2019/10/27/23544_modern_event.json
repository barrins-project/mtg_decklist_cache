The deck includes protection pieces like Giver of Runes and Shalai, Voice of Plenty to ensure the combo can safely go off, while also including value creatures and land cards to provide additional utility and flexibility."

The deck also aims to fill the opponent's graveyard with cards like Thought Scour in order to power up graveyard-dependent spells like Drown in the Loch and Tarmogoyf. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's color requirements and enable efficient fetching with Polluted Delta and Misty Rainforest."

By utilizing cards like Cryptic Command, Path to Exile, and Force of Negation, along with powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and out-value them in the long run. The deck also includes a Stoneforge Mystic package to search for equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine to provide additional threats and value."
