With a mix of disruptive elements and aggressive threats, this deck seeks to overwhelm opponents before they can stabilize and mount a defense."

The deck also includes protection spells such as Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense, as well as additional ways to ensure your combo goes off smoothly like Once Upon a Time and Pendelhaven. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with poison counters before they can effectively respond."
