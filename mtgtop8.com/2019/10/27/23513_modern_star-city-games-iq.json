Snapcaster Mage is used to recast key spells from the graveyard, while cards like Mishra's Bauble and Thought Scour help to set up the graveyard for delve spells. The deck aims to control the board early on with removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember, and close out the game quickly with powerful finishers like Temur Battle Rage. The Royal Scions provide additional card selection and pump up the team for a final assault."
