By utilizing cards like Eldritch Evolution, Finale of Devastation, and Postmortem Lunge, the deck can search for specific creatures needed for its combo while also being able to bring them back from the graveyard. This allows the deck to consistently combo off with cards like Devoted Druid and Vizier of Remedies, creating a strong board presence in a short amount of time. The toolbox aspect of the deck helps adapt to various situations and opponents."
