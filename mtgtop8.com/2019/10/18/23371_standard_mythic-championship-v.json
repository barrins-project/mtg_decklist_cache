The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by generating card advantage and consistently hitting land drops to power out its threats."

The synergy between Cauldron Familiar, Witch's Oven, and Mayhem Devil allows for repeated damage and card advantage. Cards like Claim the Firstborn and Angrath's Rampage help to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining pressure. The deck aims to curve out efficiently and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of early aggression and disruptive plays, ultimately leading to victory through a combination of creature damage and burn spells."
