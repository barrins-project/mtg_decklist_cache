The deck aims to pressure the opponent early on with aggressive creatures like Brineborn Cutthroat and Wildborn Preserver, backed up by powerful tempo plays like Brazen Borrower. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Mu Yanling, Sky Dancer provides additional threats and utility, contributing to the overall aggressive strategy of the deck. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
