            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly filling the graveyard with powerful creatures such as Griselbrand, Elesh Norn, and Ashen Rider using cards like Entomb and Faithless Looting. It then uses reanimation spells like Animate Dead and Reanimate to bring these creatures back into play for a game-winning combo. Cards like Lotus Petal and Dark Ritual help to mana ramp and accelerate the reanimation process. The inclusion of Chancellor of the Annex and Cabal Therapy provides disruption and protection against opposing strategies. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with massive creatures before they can establish a defense."
