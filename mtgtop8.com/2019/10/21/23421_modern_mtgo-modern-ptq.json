The combo potential is high, utilizing Greater Gargadon as a finisher and utilizing cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Finale of Promise to ramp up and create explosive plays. The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a mix of powerful spells and efficient mana usage, maintaining a delicate balance between combo pieces and control elements."

The deck aims to protect its threats while controlling the board and tempo of the game. Cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Cryptic Command, and Snapcaster Mage provide powerful card advantage and flexibility in dealing with threats. With a mix of counterspells, removal, and card draw, the deck looks to outvalue the opponent while maintaining control of the game. The inclusion of Blood Moon also provides additional disruption against multicolored decks."
