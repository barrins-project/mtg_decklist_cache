By aggressively attacking the opponent with creatures like Skarrgan Pit-Skulk and River Boa, and enhancing them with spells like Rancor and Elephant Guide, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Quirion Ranger and Nettle Sentinel allow for extra flexibility and mana efficiency, while cards like Savage Swipe and Vines of Vastwood provide removal and protection for key creatures."
