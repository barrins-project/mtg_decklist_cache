The win condition is typically through attacking with powerful equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine and Batterskull."

It aims to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react defensively, while also being able to deal direct damage to the opponent's life total. The combination of burn spells, creatures with haste and aggressive combat tricks makes it difficult for the opponent to stabilize and turn the game around. The deck prioritizes speed and consistency to close out games before the opponent can establish a strong board presence."
