The deck also includes disruptive elements like Chalice of the Void and Karn, the Great Creator to control the board. The mana acceleration provided by Mox Opal and Lotus Petal helps to set up the combo quickly, while cards like Mystic Forge provide additional card selection and synergy with artifacts. The deck aims to outpace and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful combos and disruption."

Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Price of Progress punish opponents for playing non-basic lands, while Fireblast provides a powerful finisher. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with damage before they can establish their own game plan."
