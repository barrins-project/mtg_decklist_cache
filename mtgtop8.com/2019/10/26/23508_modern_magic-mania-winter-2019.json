The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for flexible creature deployment and helps maintain pressure on the opponent. Overall, the deck emphasizes consistency and synergy among its human creature cards."

It utilizes cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer, Thopter Foundry, and Sword of the Meek to generate tokens and create a strong board presence. The deck also includes cards like Ensnaring Bridge, Damping Sphere, and Pithing Needle to slow down the opponent and prevent them from executing their game plan effectively. With cards like Whir of Invention and Goblin Engineer, the deck can tutor for important artifacts and maintain board control to ultimately outvalue the opponent."
