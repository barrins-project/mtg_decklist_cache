It uses powerful planeswalkers like Karn Liberated and Karn, the Great Creator to control the game and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also includes big threats like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to close out the game. With access to powerful colorless spells and creatures, this deck aims to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with its late-game threats."
