The deck utilizes cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer and Engineered Explosives to control the board, while cards like Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Oko, Thief of Crowns provide additional ways to generate value. The inclusion of cards like Gilded Goose and Mishra's Bauble help accelerate the mana base and provide additional card draw.
