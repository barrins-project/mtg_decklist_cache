By using cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Hidden Herbalists to generate additional mana, and powerful creatures like Goblin Guide and Hexdrinker, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent from the early turns. Cards like Reckless Bushwhacker and Atarka's Command provide additional reach and damage to finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. The deck's mana base is optimized to support its aggressive game plan."

The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Path to Exile to deal with opposing threats. Additionally, it utilizes value cards like Liliana of the Veil and Lingering Souls to generate card advantage and control the board. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color combination while still being able to cast its spells effectively."
