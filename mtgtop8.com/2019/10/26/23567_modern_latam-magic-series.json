By enchanting creatures like Gladecover Scout and Slippery Bogle with powerful auras like Daybreak Coronet and Ethereal Armor, the deck aims to quickly build up a strong, evasive threat. The inclusion of Leyline of Sanctity provides protection against targeted spells and abilities, making it difficult for opponents to disrupt the strategy of the deck. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a highly resilient and aggressive creature."

By quickly ramping up the board presence and dealing direct damage to the opponent, the deck aims to finish the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Atarka's Command and Reckless Bushwhacker further enhances the aggro strategy by providing additional reach and tempo advantage."
