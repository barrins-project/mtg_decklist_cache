The rest of the deck consists of mana ramp and fixing to support the combo pieces and ensure a consistent and powerful board presence. The key strategy is to rapidly execute the combo while disrupting the opponent's game plan."

Using a mix of countermagic, card filtering, and tempo plays, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and protect its own threats. The inclusion of cards like Counterbalance and Brazen Borrower adds versatility and disruption, while the mana base of fetch lands and Wasteland provides consistency and disruption. Overall, the deck seeks to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining a strong offensive presence."

The deck also utilizes cards like Reanimate and Street Wraith to efficiently lower its own life total to maximize the power of Death's Shadow. With a combination of disruption and fast threats, the deck aims to apply pressure and win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
