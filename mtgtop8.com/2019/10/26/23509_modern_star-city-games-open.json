It utilizes cards like Street Wraith and Mishra's Bauble to help cycle through the deck and enable Death's Shadow to enter the battlefield as a powerful creature. The deck also includes disruption in the form of hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Stubborn Denial, along with removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember. The goal is to apply pressure early and finish off opponents with big swings from Death's Shadow and other threats."
