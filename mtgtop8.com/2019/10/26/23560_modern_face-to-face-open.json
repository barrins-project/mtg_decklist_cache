The deck focuses on controlling the board and limiting the opponent's options through disruption and card advantage. By utilizing cards like Narset, Parter of Veils to prevent card draw and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to manipulate the opponent's deck, the deck aims to maintain dominance and ultimately win through attrition and efficient control. The mana base is designed to support the control elements and ensure consistent access to the necessary resources."
