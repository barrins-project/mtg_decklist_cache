Overall, the key concept of this deck is to deal lethal poison counters as quickly as possible before the opponent can respond."

The deck can also disrupt opponents with cards like Chalice of the Void and Walking Ballista while utilizing colorless spells like All Is Dust and Ugin, the Ineffable to control the board. Karn, the Great Creator provides additional utility and flexibility, making this deck a formidable Aggro deck that combines fast mana ramp and disruptive control elements."

It aims to stall the game, draw cards, and eventually win through card advantage and incremental advantage. The deck is designed to out-value the opponent in the late game by efficiently answering threats and generating card advantage through powerful card draw engines like Narset, Parter of Veils and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. Mystic Sanctuary is used to recur important spells and ensure the control player maintains control over the game."
