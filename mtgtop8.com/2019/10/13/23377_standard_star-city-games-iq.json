The deck aims to ramp up mana quickly with cards like Growth Spiral and Circuitous Route to eventually play big threats like Golos, Tireless Pilgrim and Hydroid Krasis. The inclusion of Fae of Wishes allows for flexibility in finding specific answers from the sideboard. The deck also utilizes Field of the Dead to generate a large army of zombie tokens, overwhelming the opponent with value and inevitability."
