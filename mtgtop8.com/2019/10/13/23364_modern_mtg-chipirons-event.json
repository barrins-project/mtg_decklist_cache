By consistently dredging cards into the graveyard, the deck aims to create a powerful board presence and overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures. Additionally, cards like Creeping Chill provide added reach and burn potential to close out games quickly. The deck thrives on synergy between its cards and the graveyard, creating a fast and aggressive playstyle."

By ramping up with Eldrazi Temple and other mana-producing lands, the deck can quickly cast threats like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer. Karn, the Great Creator provides utility and disruption, while cards like Chalice of the Void and All Is Dust help control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain board dominance to secure a victory before the opponent can stabilize."
