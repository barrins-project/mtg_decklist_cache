Using cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer and Thopter Foundry/Sword of the Meek combo, the deck generates value and can create an army of Thopter tokens. With various utility artifacts like Wishclaw Talisman and Damping Sphere, the deck can disrupt the opponent's game plan while advancing its own win conditions. Overall, the strategy revolves around using artifacts to control the board and outvalue the opponent in the long run."
