By ramping quickly with cards like Growth Spiral and Circuitous Route, the deck can quickly get to its powerful late game threats like Golos, Tireless Pilgrim and Hydroid Krasis. Teferi, Time Raveler provides disruption and Kenrith, the Returned King adds versatility and a finisher. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent with its powerful threats and control elements, ultimately overwhelming them with its late game power."

The key strategy is to establish a strong board presence with cards like Field of the Dead while also having access to versatile removal options like Realm-Cloaked Giant and Time Wipe. The deck also includes a toolbox sideboard with Fae of Wishes to search for specific answers or threats when needed. This allows for adaptability and resilience against a variety of opposing strategies."
