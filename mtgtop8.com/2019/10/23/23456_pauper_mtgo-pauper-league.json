By efficiently casting spells and utilizing artifacts, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive threats like Atog and Gearseeker Serpent. The key strategy involves generating card advantage with cards like Thoughtcast while also using artifacts like Prophetic Prism and Chromatic Star for mana fixing. The inclusion of cards like Fling and Temur Battle Rage provide additional reach and potential for lethal attacks. Additionally, Relic of Progenitus helps disrupt graveyard strategies while Navigator's Compass provides vital life gain in aggro matchups."
