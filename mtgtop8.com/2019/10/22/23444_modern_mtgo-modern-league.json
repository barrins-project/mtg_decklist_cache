The goal is to pump up these creatures with instant spells such as Scale Up and Might of Old Krosa to hit the opponent for lethal poison damage in just a few turns. Additionally, the deck includes disruption spells like Spell Pierce and Dismember to control the opponent's game plan and ensure a swift victory through infect damage."
