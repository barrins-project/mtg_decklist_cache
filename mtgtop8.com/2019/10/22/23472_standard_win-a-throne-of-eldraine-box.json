Deafening Clarion and Time Wipe provide board wipes to handle threats on the battlefield, while Fae of Wishes can search for crucial sideboard cards. The deck focuses on progressive card advantage and removal to maintain dominance and outlast opponents in a 1 vs 1 format."

With a mix of creatures, planeswalkers, and powerful spells, this Temur Aggro deck aims to quickly establish dominance on the battlefield and disrupt your opponent's game plan."
