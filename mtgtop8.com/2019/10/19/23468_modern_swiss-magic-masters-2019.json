The deck also utilizes Aether Vial and Cavern of Souls to help cast its creatures more efficiently, leading to a fast clock and putting pressure on the opponent to find answers."

By playing cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer, Emry, Lurker of the Loch, and Saheeli, Sublime Artificer, the deck can efficiently untap permanents, draw cards, and create a token swarm. Paradoxical Outcome and Mirrodin Besieged provide additional ways to generate value and trigger the combo. With the mana acceleration from Mox Opal and Mox Amber, the deck aims to quickly assemble the necessary pieces to create a formidable board state and overwhelm the opponent."
