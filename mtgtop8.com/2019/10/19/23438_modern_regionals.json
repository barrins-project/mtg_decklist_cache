The goal is to have enough mountains in play to deal lethal damage to the opponent by triggering Valakut's ability when playing lands like Cinder Glade and Stomping Ground. Additionally, cards like Summoner's Pact and Explore help to maintain card advantage and ensure the combo can be executed efficiently."
