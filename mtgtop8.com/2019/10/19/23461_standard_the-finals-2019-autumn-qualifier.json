With cards like Embercleave and Skarrgan Hellkite to enhance their creatures' combat abilities, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of Domri, Anarch of Bolas and Domri's Ambush provides additional removal and combat tricks to maintain board control. The deck also benefits from mana acceleration through Paradise Druid and efficient card draw with Once Upon a Time."
