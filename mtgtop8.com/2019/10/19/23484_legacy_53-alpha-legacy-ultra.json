Cards like True-Name Nemesis and Lord of Atlantis provide powerful threats that can quickly close out the game, while cards like Force of Will provide protection and disruption against opposing strategies. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and control, leveraging the synergies between Merfolk creatures and various support cards to secure victory."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Blood Moon and Chalice of the Void, while locking down the board with Ensnaring Bridge. Additionally, the deck utilizes aggressive creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Legion Warboss to apply pressure and end the game quickly, taking advantage of the opponent's inability to effectively respond."
