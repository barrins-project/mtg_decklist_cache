The deck includes strong creatures like Tarmogoyf and Bloodbraid Elf, along with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to control the board. It also includes planeswalkers like Wrenn and Six and Liliana of the Veil to provide additional value and disruption. The mana base is designed to support a fast and consistent mana curve. Overall, the deck aims to establish an early advantage and maintain pressure on the opponent throughout the game."
