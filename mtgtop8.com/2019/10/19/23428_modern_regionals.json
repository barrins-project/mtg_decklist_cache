The deck also includes removal spells like Dismember and Oblivion Stone for control, and planeswalkers like Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon for additional win conditions. The overall strategy is to control the game until assembling Tron and overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats."

It utilizes ramp spells like Farseek and Explore to quickly search for and play lands, while also using Primeval Titan to search for Valakut and more mountains. Chalice of the Void helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Hour of Promise can search for multiple lands at once. The deck aims to win the game by ramping up its mana quickly and then casting Scapeshift to trigger Valakut's ability multiple times, dealing lethal damage."
