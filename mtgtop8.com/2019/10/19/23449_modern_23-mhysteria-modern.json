By using cards like Mausoleum Wanderer and Supreme Phantom to boost the spirits' power, along with Aether Vial and Stoneforge Mystic to cheat equipment into play, this deck aims to quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Spell Queller and Path to Exile provide disruption and removal, while cards like Drogskol Captain and Unsettled Mariner help protect the spirits from opposing spells and abilities."

By protecting key creatures like Kor Spiritdancer, Slippery Bogle, and Gladecover Scout with cards like Rancor, Ethereal Armor and Daybreak Coronet, the deck aims to create unstoppable threats that are difficult to deal with. With a mix of evasion, card draw, and creature removal, this deck aims to quickly establish a dominant board presence and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
