The inclusion of lands like Tolaria West and Vesuva adds flexibility and utility to the deck, while also enabling the player to find key combo pieces when needed. Ultimately, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent with large threats and value generation."

By using disruptive creatures such as Tidehollow Sculler and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, along with removal spells like Path to Exile, the deck aims to control the board while applying pressure. Stoneforge Mystic helps to find key equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Fire and Ice, providing additional ways to win the game. Giver of Runes offers protection against removal, while Eldrazi Displacer and Flickerwisp create value by blinking creatures for additional effects."
