            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to ramp up mana quickly using cards like Search for Tomorrow, Farseek, and Sakura-Tribe Elder, in order to play Primeval Titan and Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle to deal massive damage to the opponent. Cards like Scapeshift and Mwonvuli Acid-Moss help ensure consistent land drops and further ramping. The deck also includes some removal spells like Lightning Bolt and a versatile creature like Reclamation Sage for added utility. Overall, the goal is to assemble the combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with big plays and powerful spells."
