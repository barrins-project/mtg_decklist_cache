The deck utilizes Urza, Lord High Artificer as the main win condition, while also incorporating Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek for additional combo potential. Control elements such as Damping Sphere, Ensnaring Bridge, and Whir of Invention help to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect the combo pieces. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through careful resource management and strategic decision-making."
