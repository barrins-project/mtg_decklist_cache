The inclusion of cards like Force of Will and Spell Pierce help protect key plays, while versatile cards like Council's Judgment offer additional removal options. Overall, the deck aims to outlast opponents and secure victory through smart plays and strategic card choices."

            "notes": "This Eldrazi Aggro deck focuses on quickly deploying powerful Eldrazi creatures such as Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer, with support from cards like Chalice of the Void and Cavern of Souls to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes mana acceleration options like Simian Spirit Guide and Ancient Tomb to help ramp into bigger threats early on. By utilizing Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's mana base and applying early pressure with efficient creatures, this deck aims to overwhelm and outpace the opponent in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
