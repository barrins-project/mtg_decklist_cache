By combining efficient threats like Delver of Secrets, Tarmogoyf, and True-Name Nemesis with disruptive spells like Stifle, Spell Pierce, and Force of Will, the deck aims to control the tempo of the game and prevent the opponent from executing their strategy. Wasteland is included to disrupt the opponent's mana base, while cards like Brainstorm and Ponder help to find the necessary pieces to maintain pressure and protect your own threats."
