The toolbox aspect of the deck allows for flexibility in finding the right creature for the situation, while cards like Giver of Runes and Vizier of Remedies help protect key pieces and enable infinite combos. Additionally, the inclusion of Gavony Township provides a way to pump up the team for a lethal attack."
