The deck utilizes a combination of goblins and other red creatures to create a fast-paced, aggressive strategy, with a heavy emphasis on direct damage and utilizing sacrifice effects for additional reach. The mana base is streamlined to maximize the chances of having the necessary resources to deploy threats and finish the opponent off before they can stabilize."
