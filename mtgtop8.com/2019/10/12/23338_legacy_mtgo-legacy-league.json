By dredging through your deck with cards like Golgari Grave-Troll and Stinkweed Imp, you can fill your graveyard with creatures and trigger abilities like Bridge from Below and Creeping Chill. This allows you to swarm the board with creatures, disrupt your opponent's strategy with Cabal Therapy, and ultimately overwhelm them with a powerful board presence."
