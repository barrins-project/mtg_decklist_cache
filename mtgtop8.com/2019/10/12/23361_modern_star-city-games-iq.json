Karn, the Great Creator provides additional utility and Silver Bullet options with its -2 ability. The deck also includes tools like Walking Ballista and Engineered Explosives for removal and disruption. Overall, the key strategy is to quickly set up the combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with powerful land and creature interactions."

This allows the player to cast powerful colorless spells such as Karn Liberated and Wurmcoil Engine. The deck also utilizes cards like Oblivion Stone and Karn, the Great Creator to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. By efficiently ramping up mana and controlling the battlefield, the deck aims to outvalue and outpace the opponent."
