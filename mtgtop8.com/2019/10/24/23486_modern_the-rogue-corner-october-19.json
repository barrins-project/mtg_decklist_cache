The key strategy is to lock opponents out of their resources with cards like Howling Mine and Narset, Parter of Veils while also utilizing cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Cryptic Command to control the board. The deck aims to establish a strong board presence and overwhelm opponents with a consistent stream of extra turns and card draw."
