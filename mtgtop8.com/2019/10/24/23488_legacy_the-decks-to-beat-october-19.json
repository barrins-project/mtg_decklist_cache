By using cards like Lotus Petal and Sneak Attack, the player can bypass the high mana cost of these creatures and overwhelm their opponent with powerful threats. The deck also includes plenty of counter spells and card selection tools to protect the combo and ensure consistency. Utilizing these tools effectively, the deck aims to win the game through explosive plays and overwhelming the opponent with massive creatures."
