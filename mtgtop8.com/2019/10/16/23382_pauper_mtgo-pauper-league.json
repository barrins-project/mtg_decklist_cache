By combining removal spells like Chainer's Edict and Disfigure with the powerful recurring damage of Pestilence, the deck can effectively control the board state and outvalue the opponent. The deck also has ways to gain life, such as Pristine Talisman and Radiant Fountain, to help stabilize and outlast aggressive opponents."
