By dredging cards and discarding them with cards like Phantasmagorian and Cabal Therapy, the deck can trigger powerful effects like bringing back Prized Amalgam, Narcomoeba, and Ichorid from the graveyard. This strategy allows for explosive turns where the deck can overwhelm the opponent with a mass of creatures while also utilizing cards like Dread Return and Bridge from Below for additional combo potential."
