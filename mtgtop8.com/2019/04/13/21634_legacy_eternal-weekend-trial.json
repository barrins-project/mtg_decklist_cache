The deck aims to stabilize the board with cards like Terminus and Council's Judgment, while also generating card advantage with Brainstorm and Accumulated Knowledge. Additionally, the deck has control elements with Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Back to Basics to disrupt opponent's strategies. This UWx Control deck focuses on outlasting opponents and establishing dominance in the late game."
