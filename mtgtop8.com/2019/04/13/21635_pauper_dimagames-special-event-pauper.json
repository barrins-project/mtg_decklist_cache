The deck also utilizes powerful draw spells like Brainstorm and Preordain to maintain card advantage. The inclusion of cards like Daze and Foil allows the deck to protect its key threats while keeping the opponent on the back foot. Overall, this deck aims to control the game tempo and clock the opponent out efficiently."
