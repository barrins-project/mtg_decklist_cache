The deck focuses on developing a wide board presence early on through cards like Legion's Landing and Benalish Marshal, while utilizing cards like Venerated Loxodon to buff your creatures and History of Benalia for additional token generation. The inclusion of protection cards like Dauntless Bodyguard and removal cards like Baffling End and Conclave Tribunal ensures that your creatures can stay on the battlefield and continue to apply pressure."
