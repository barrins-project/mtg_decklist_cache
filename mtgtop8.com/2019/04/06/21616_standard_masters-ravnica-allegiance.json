By combining cards that provide card advantage like Jadelight Ranger and Wildgrowth Walker with powerful threats like Hydroid Krasis and Carnage Tyrant, the deck aims to control the board and outpace the opponent. Hostage Taker adds flexibility and disruption. Vivien Reid provides additional card advantage and removal. The mana base is optimized to consistently hit all three colors and ensure the deck runs smoothly."
