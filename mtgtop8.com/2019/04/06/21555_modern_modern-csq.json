The main goal is to assemble a critical mass of spells, generate a large amount of mana, and then use Past in Flames to recast previously played spells for a lethal Grapeshot or a swarm of tokens via Empty the Warrens."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while slowly gaining incremental advantage until it can stabilize and win the game with powerful planeswalkers or creature lands like Celestial Colonnade. The deck is built to handle a variety of threats and is capable of adapting to different matchups through its versatile suite of interactive spells."
