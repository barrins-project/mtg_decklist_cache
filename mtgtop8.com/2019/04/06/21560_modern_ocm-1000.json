Additional cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze punish opponents for playing spells or creatures, further pressuring them to act quickly or risk taking significant damage."

The deck focuses on quickly filling the graveyard with cards like Faithless Looting and Cathartic Reunion, triggering powerful effects like Bloodghast, Narcomoeba, and Prized Amalgam to overwhelm the opponent. Cards like Creeping Chill provide additional reach and Conflagrate can be used to finish off the opponent or clear the board. The deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent before they can respond."
