It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering key spells, removing threats, and wiping the board clean with mass removal spells. The deck includes a variety of planeswalkers that generate card advantage and help stabilize the board. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency and to support the triple-color requirements of the deck. Overall, the deck seeks to control the game until it can establish a dominant position to win."

It also includes disruption and removal spells like Vraska's Contempt and Hostage Taker to control the board. The deck also has some powerful finishers like Carnage Tyrant and Liliana, Dreadhorde General to close out the game. The combination of aggro creatures, removal, and strong finishers makes this deck a versatile and powerful option in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
