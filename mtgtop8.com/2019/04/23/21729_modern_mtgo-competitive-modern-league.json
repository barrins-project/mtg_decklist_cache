The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent early in the game, forcing them to react to the constant stream of damage. By utilizing cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel, Goblin Guide, and a variety of burn spells, the deck seeks to outpace and overwhelm the opponent, not allowing them to stabilize or establish their own game plan. Overall, the deck is focused on winning as fast as possible through aggressive play and direct damage."

With cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Thoughtseize to protect yourself, you can slowly grind out a victory by locking down the game and preventing your opponent from making any meaningful plays."
