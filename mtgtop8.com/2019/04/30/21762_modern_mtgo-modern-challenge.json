Additionally, using cards like Burning Inquiry, Faithless Looting, and Goblin Lore allows the player to cycle through their deck and potentially put more creatures into the graveyard. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle, while also utilizing removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to deal with any threats the opponent may have."
