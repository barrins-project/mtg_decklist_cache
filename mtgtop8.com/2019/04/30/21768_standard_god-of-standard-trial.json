The graveyard recursion provided by Find / Finality and Memorial to Folly ensures the deck can maintain board presence even after removal. Vivien Reid helps to dig for key cards, while Merfolk Branchwalker and Jadelight Ranger provide card advantage and help to grow Wildgrowth Walker. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient threats and disruption."
