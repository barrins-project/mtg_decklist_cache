By discarding cards and using rituals, the deck aims to cheat out massive threats like Griselbrand and Worldspine Wurm as early as possible. The deck also includes ways to gain life, such as Nourishing Shoal, to help offset the life loss from reanimating creatures. Finally, the deck includes ways to quickly generate mana, such as Simian Spirit Guide and Desperate Ritual, to cast game-ending spells like Through the Breach."
