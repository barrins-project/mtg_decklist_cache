The deck also utilizes powerful equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte to further increase its aggressive potential. By utilizing cards that disrupt the opponent's strategy while building up its own board presence, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory through a combination of disruption and aggression."
