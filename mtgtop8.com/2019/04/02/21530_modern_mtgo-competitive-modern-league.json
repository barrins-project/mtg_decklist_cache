            "notes": "This Golgari Aggro deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's hand and board while also deploying threats that grow larger as the game progresses. By using a combination of powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and aggressive creatures like Tarmogoyf and Siege Rhino, the deck can quickly apply pressure and force the opponent to react. The inclusion of removal spells like Assassin's Trophy and Path to Exile ensures that the opponent's threats are kept in check, allowing the deck to continue its aggressive game plan."
