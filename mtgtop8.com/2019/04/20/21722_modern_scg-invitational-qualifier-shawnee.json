The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods to control the board."

The deck also aims to stabilize the board with powerful creatures like Restoration Angel and Kitchen Finks, while also having access to strong removal spells like Path to Exile and Settle the Wreckage. The manabase is optimized for consistency and flexibility, allowing for smooth casting of spells and activation of utility lands like Celestial Colonnade and Field of Ruin."
