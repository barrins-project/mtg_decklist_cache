This is done through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and powerful planeswalker cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, and Kaya, Orzhov Usurper. The deck also includes card draw and manipulation spells to ensure consistency in drawing into the necessary answers. Overall, the goal is to outlast your opponent and win through incremental advantage and superior resource management."
