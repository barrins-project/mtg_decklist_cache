The deck focuses on casting cheap spells like Serum Visions, Opt, and Thought Scour to enable the graveyard shenanigans. Pyromancer Ascension and Manamorphose help generate extra value while Surgical Extraction and Lightning Bolt provide disruption and removal. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, aggressive plays and graveyard synergies."

The deck can also disrupt the opponent's mana base with cards like Blood Moon, while also generating value through cards like Lingering Souls and Faithless Looting. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of threats and disruption."
