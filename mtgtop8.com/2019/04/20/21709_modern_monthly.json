Utilizing a combination of cheap cantrips, removal spells, and threats like Thing in the Ice and Crackling Drake, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and creatures. By efficiently cycling through the deck and utilizing graveyard recursion, this deck can quickly close out games through aggressive plays and efficient use of resources."
