The deck aims to stabilize with cards like Ghostly Prison and Serra Ascendant before closing out the game with a huge life swing using Martyr of Sands. The deck also includes utility cards like Cast Out and Crucible of Worlds to handle various threats and keep the opponent on the back foot. Ultimately, the goal is to out-value the opponent and secure a win through attrition."
