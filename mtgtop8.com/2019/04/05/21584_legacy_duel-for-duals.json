It aims to quickly generate a 20/20 Marit Lage token by sacrificing the Dark Depths land with zero ice counters. The deck includes various tools like Duress, Thoughtseize, and Pithing Needle to disrupt opponents and protect the combo. It also features accelerants like Lotus Petal and Elvish Spirit Guide to speed up the combo's execution. The deck's strategy is to assemble the combo efficiently while controlling the game and protecting its key pieces."
