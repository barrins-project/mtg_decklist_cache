Once the graveyard is full, Living End is cast to bring all the creatures back onto the battlefield, often overwhelming the opponent with a sudden army of strong creatures like Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite and Demigod of Revenge. Cards like Hollow One and Street Wraith provide additional value, making this deck a powerful and explosive combo strategy in Modern 1 vs 1."
