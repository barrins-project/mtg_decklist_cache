Pyromancer Ascension provides additional value by duplicating spells, and Snapcaster Mage offers flexibility by flashbacking key instants. The deck's strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggressive creatures and direct damage spells."

The deck aims to consistently answer threats with cards like Path to Exile, Detention Sphere, and Cryptic Command while maintaining card advantage and board presence with planeswalkers such as Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Search for Azcanta and Snapcaster Mage to provide card selection and recursion. With a solid mana base and versatile answers, this deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
