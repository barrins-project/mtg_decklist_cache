This mana is used to cast powerful threats like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, while also providing flexibility with cards like Warping Wail and Oblivion Stone for control purposes. The deck also includes card filtering and searching tools like Ancient Stirrings and Expedition Map to help find key pieces and ensure consistency in executing its game plan."
