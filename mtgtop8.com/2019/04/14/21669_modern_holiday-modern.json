The deck utilizes cards like Faithless Looting, Thought Scour, and Opt to fill the graveyard while also running a mix of removal spells and creatures to pressure the opponent. Pyromancer Ascension can also help increase the deck's spell efficiency, allowing for explosive turns and overwhelming board presence. The goal is to continuously bring back Arclight Phoenix and apply pressure while controlling the board with various removal options."
