Cards like Spreading Seas disrupt the opponent's mana base while also drawing cards, and Aether Vial allows for instant-speed creature deployment. The Merfolk tribe benefits from having multiple bodies on the battlefield, synergizing well with tribal support cards like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient creature-based strategy."
