The deck also utilizes efficient spells like Fatal Push and Dismember to control the board and close out games with burst damage from cards like Temur Battle Rage. By combining efficient removal with powerful threats, this deck aims to win quickly and decisively in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."

This mana is then used to play powerful colorless threats like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, and Wurmcoil Engine to control the game and overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to help find the Urza lands consistently, ensuring a strong late-game presence."

The deck also utilizes cards like Thing in the Ice and Pyromancer Ascension to control the board and generate value. With a mix of card draw, removal, and powerful threats, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and card advantage in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."
