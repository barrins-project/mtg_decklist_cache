In addition, the deck includes disruption and control elements such as Thoughtseize, Fatal Push, and Ensnaring Bridge to protect the combo and hinder the opponent's strategy. The goal is to mill the opponent out before they can win through traditional means."

This is achieved through efficient mana production with cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, as well as boosting the creatures with Cranial Plating and Steel Overseer. The key strategy is to equip the creatures with Cranial Plating and use Galvanic Blast for removal, while maintaining a resilient board state with cards like Etched Champion and Vault Skirge. The deck relies on synergy between artifacts and creatures to quickly overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."

The deck also includes card draw and filtering effects to find the right answers at the right time. With a mix of board wipes and spot removal, as well as graveyard hate with Relic of Progenitus, the deck aims to outlast its opponents and win through attrition. Celestial Colonnade provides a win condition, while Search for Azcanta helps to dig for more answers."
