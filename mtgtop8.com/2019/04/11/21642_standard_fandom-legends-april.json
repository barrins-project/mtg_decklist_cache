By playing cheap creatures like Fanatical Firebrand and Ghitu Lavarunner early on, and using efficient burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock to clear the way, the deck aims to quickly deal damage to the opponent before they can stabilize. Cards like Experimental Frenzy and Light Up the Stage provide card advantage and allow for continuous pressure, while Runaway Steam-Kin and Viashino Pyromancer add to the deck's aggressive strategy."

The key strategy is to commit to the aggressive playstyle early on, constantly pressuring opponents and maintaining board presence to secure victory."
