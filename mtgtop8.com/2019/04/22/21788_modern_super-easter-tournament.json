Animation Module helps to generate additional tokens and Inkmoth Nexus provides a potential infect win condition. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of powerful creatures that benefit from the synergies provided by Hardened Scales."

This enables the deck to repeatedly return creatures from the graveyard to the battlefield, creating a constant stream of threats for the opponent to deal with. The deck also utilizes cards like Darkblast and Conflagrate to control the board and finish off opponents. The mana base includes fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistent mana production for the combo."
