The deck also includes cards like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to tutor for specific lands, ensuring the Tron lands are assembled efficiently. Additionally, cards like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus provide disruption against opposing strategies."

By using mana-fixing lands and creature-synergistic spells, the deck aims to curve out efficiently and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With powerful Human tribal cards like Champion of the Parish, Thalia's Lieutenant, and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, supported by disruptive creatures like Meddling Mage and Reflector Mage, this deck can apply early pressure and maintain tempo throughout the game. By utilizing Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play and maximize mana efficiency, the deck can quickly close out games before opponents have a chance to stabilize."
