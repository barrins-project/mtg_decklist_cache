It utilizes cards like Aven Riftwatcher and Guardian of the Guildpact to gain life and protect itself, while also running removal spells like Doom Blade and Chainer's Edict to deal with threats. The deck also has card draw and mana fixing in Prophetic Prism, allowing for consistent plays and a steady mana base. With careful resource management and strategic use of Pestilence, this deck aims to outlast and outvalue the opponent."
