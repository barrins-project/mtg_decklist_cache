The key strategy is to maintain a fast pace and apply constant pressure on the opponent, preventing them from stabilizing or mounting a strong defense. By utilizing a combination of burn spells and hasty creatures, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to establish control or gain too much life. The deck's main goal is to close out the game as quickly as possible, overwhelming the opponent with its aggressive strategy."
