This allows you to quickly overwhelm your opponent while protecting your creatures from removal spells. Additionally, Leyline of Sanctity provides protection for yourself, ensuring you can safely build up your board without fear of disruption. The deck aims to create a fast clock and close out the game before the opponent can mount a defense."
