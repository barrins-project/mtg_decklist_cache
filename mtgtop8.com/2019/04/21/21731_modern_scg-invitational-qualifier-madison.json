With a heavy emphasis on low-cost creatures, such as Reflector Mage, Phantasmal Image, and Mantis Rider, the deck aims to maintain a fast and aggressive pace. The inclusion of cards like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter further disrupts the opponent's strategy. The deck also utilizes key mana fixers like Noble Hierarch and Ancient Ziggurat to ensure smooth gameplay. Thalia's Lieutenant and Champion of the Parish bolster the strength of the human creatures, while Thalia, Guardian of Thraben adds additional disruption. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for instant creature deployment, while Unclaimed Territory ensures efficient mana usage. Overall, this deck capitalizes on the aggro nature of humans for swift victories."

Using efficient pump spells and protection cards, it aims to maximize the power of its infect creatures like Glistener Elf and Blighted Agent. The deck also includes land cards that provide additional benefits, such as Pendelhaven for creature boosting. By carefully managing resources and timing plays correctly, the deck can overwhelm opponents and secure victory before they have a chance to respond effectively. It is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that requires precision and skill to execute successfully."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and keep the board clear with cards like Terminus and Supreme Verdict, while drawing cards and filtering through the deck with Serum Visions and Opt. It also includes some spot removal with Path to Exile and Condemn, as well as additional counterspells with Negate and Cryptic Command."
