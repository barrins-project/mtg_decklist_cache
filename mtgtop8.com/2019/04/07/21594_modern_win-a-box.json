Shaman of the Pack is used as a finisher to deal damage to the opponent based on the number of Elves you control. The deck also includes cards like Collected Company to quickly search for and play key Elves from the deck."

Additional card advantage and graveyard hate are provided by cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Scavenging Ooze. The deck also utilizes versatile lands like Hissing Quagmire and Treetop Village to apply pressure on the opponent."
