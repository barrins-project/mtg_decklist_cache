It includes disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Stubborn Denial to control the game and protect its threats. The deck also uses card draw and graveyard manipulation effects like Thought Scour and Mishra's Bauble to maintain a consistent flow of spells. Overall, the strategy revolves around putting pressure on the opponent early and efficiently closing out the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
