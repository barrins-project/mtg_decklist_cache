It also includes various utility lands and spells to provide flexibility and disruption against opposing strategies. The key strategy revolves around efficiently tutoring for key pieces and exploiting the synergy between Amulet of Vigor and bounce lands to generate massive amounts of mana and flood the board with threats. The deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and quickly close out games through its combo potential and strong mid-to-late game threats."

By constantly dredging cards from your library and utilizing cards like Conflagrate and Darkblast, you can quickly overwhelm your opponent with a swarm of creatures and powerful spells. The key strategy is to consistently dredge your deck to put as many cards in your graveyard as possible, enabling explosive plays and overwhelming your opponent with powerful graveyard recursion."
