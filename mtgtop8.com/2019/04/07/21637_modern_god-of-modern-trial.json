By using Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play, alongside Lords of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to pump the team, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creature attacks. The inclusion of counterspells like Cursecatcher and Merfolk Trickster, as well as land disruption with Spreading Seas, provides additional versatility and control options to outmaneuver the opponent."
