Hive Mind and Pact of Negation provide protection for your combo pieces, while Walking Ballista can serve as a backup win condition. Overall, the deck aims to assemble its combo pieces quickly to overwhelm opponents with powerful Titan plays."

Using cards like Mishra's Bauble and Thought Scour to cycle through your deck and draw into the cards you need, you aim to overwhelm your opponent with aggressive threats and efficient interaction. Jace, Vryn's Prodigy provides additional value through card draw and recursion, making this deck a potent and versatile aggro strategy."
