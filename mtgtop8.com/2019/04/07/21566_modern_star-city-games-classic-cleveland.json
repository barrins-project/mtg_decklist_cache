The end goal is to cast Scapeshift and sacrifice lands to search for copies of Valakut and mountains to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent. Cards like Primeval Titan and Summoner's Pact help to search for key pieces of the combo, while cards like Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods provide removal and board control. The deck aims to win quickly through a powerful combo sequence."
