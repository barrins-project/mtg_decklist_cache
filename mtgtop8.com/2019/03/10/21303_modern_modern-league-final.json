By using cards like Selfless Spirit and Spell Queller for protection and disruption, along with lords like Supreme Phantom and Drogskol Captain to pump up the team, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. Collected Company and Aether Vial provide additional ways to quickly deploy threats onto the battlefield, while cards like Deputy of Detention help to deal with problematic permanents. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive game plan while still being able to cast the necessary spells."
