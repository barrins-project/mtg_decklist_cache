By using cards like Spellstutter Sprite, Vendilion Clique, and Mistbind Clique to counter or disrupt the opponent's spells, combined with versatile removal like Fatal Push and Cryptic Command, this deck aims to grind out incremental advantages while generating constant pressure with Bitterblossom. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana of the Veil further solidifies the deck's control strategy and allows for long-term card advantage."
