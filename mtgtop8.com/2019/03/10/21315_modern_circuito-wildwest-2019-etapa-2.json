Collected Company and Aether Vial allow for fast and efficient creature deployment, while cards like Spell Queller and Selfless Spirit provide disruption and protection. The deck also includes some removal in Path to Exile and Deputy of Detention to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the strategy revolves around overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of powerful Spirits."

By utilizing Lantern of Insight and Codex Shredder, you can manipulate the top of your opponent's deck and prevent them from drawing threats. With cards like Whir of Invention, Mox Opal, and Ancient Stirrings, you can search for specific pieces to further control the game. The deck aims to slow down the opponent's strategy and eventually lock them out of the game entirely."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while gaining card advantage through cards like Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage. The deck also utilizes land destruction with Field of Ruin to keep the opponent off their mana base. With a mix of counterspells, removal, and card advantage engines, the deck looks to outlast the opponent and win the game through incremental advantages."
