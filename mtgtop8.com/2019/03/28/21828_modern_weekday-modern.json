The key strategy is to use Faithless Looting, Serum Visions, and Thought Scour to quickly fill the graveyard with Phoenixes, while also using Thing in the Ice to control the board. The deck also includes cards like Crackling Drake and Snapcaster Mage for additional threats and card advantage. Surgical Extraction is included to disrupt opponent's plans and Pyromancer Ascension can help generate additional value from spells. Overall, the deck aims to be fast and aggressive, overwhelming opponents with a flurry of spells and creatures."
