The deck utilizes cards like Glimpse the Unthinkable, Archive Trap, and Mesmeric Orb to mill large chunks of the opponent's deck at once. Cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Collective Brutality help control the opponent's hand, while cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Fatal Push keep the opponent's creatures at bay. The deck aims to win by milling the opponent's entire library, forcing them to draw from an empty deck and lose the game."
