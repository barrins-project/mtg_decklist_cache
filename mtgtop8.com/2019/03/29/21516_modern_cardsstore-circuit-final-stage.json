            "notes": "The deck focuses on playing high-powered creatures quickly and efficiently, using cards like Aspect of Hydra and Rancor to pump up their damage output. It also includes resilient creatures like Steel Leaf Champion and Scavenging Ooze to maintain board presence. The deck's aggressive strategy is supported by cards like Vines of Vastwood and Dismember for removal, while Rhonas the Indomitable offers a powerful additional threat. By overwhelming opponents with fast, strong creatures, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent can set up their own game plan."
