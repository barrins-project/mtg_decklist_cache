Using cards like Faithless Looting, Serum Visions, and Thought Scour, the goal is to cast multiple spells in a turn to trigger Arclight Phoenix's ability. The deck also includes other threats like Crackling Drake and Thing in the Ice to provide alternate win conditions. Surgical Extraction is included for graveyard hate, while Pyromancer Ascension allows for additional spell copies. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, spell-heavy plays and hard-hitting creatures."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on assembling the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Mine, Power Plant, and Tower) to generate a large amount of colorless mana quickly. This allows the player to cast powerful colorless spells such as Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to control the game and win through sheer card advantage and powerful threats. The deck also includes cards like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to fetch the UrzaTron lands and ensure consistent mana production. Overall, the strategy revolves around overwhelming the opponent with large threats and powerful planeswalkers."
