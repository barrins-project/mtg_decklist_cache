            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly assemble the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Tower, Urza's Power Plant, Urza's Mine) to generate a large amount of colorless mana. This mana is then used to cast powerful threats such as Wurmcoil Engine, Walking Ballista, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, while also leveraging cards like Oblivion Stone and Karn Liberated for control and removal. The deck also includes various cards to help find and tutor for the UrzaTron lands, ensuring a consistent and efficient ramp strategy."
