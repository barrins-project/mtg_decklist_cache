The goal is to set up a winning sequence of cards using Doomsday and either Tendrils of Agony or Experimental Frenzy to secure victory in a single turn."

By utilizing cards like Blood Moon, Chalice of the Void, and Magus of the Moon, the deck aims to shut down the opponent's ability to cast spells effectively. Meanwhile, powerful creatures such as Chandra, Torch of Defiance, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Legion Warboss put pressure on the opponent's life total. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and disruptive elements, ultimately leading to victory."
