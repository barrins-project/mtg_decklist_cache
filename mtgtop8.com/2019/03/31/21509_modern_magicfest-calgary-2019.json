It also aims to stabilize the board with cards like Thing in the Ice and Anger of the Gods while generating card advantage through Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. Blood Moon is included to disrupt mana bases, and Ral, Izzet Viceroy provides additional card advantage and removal. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent and control the game until it can win with a threat like Thing in the Ice or through burn spells like Lightning Bolt."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with a combination of counterspells like Cryptic Command, Mana Leak, and Negate, while also efficiently dealing with threats using cards like Path to Exile and Terminus. Card advantage is gained through cards like Snapcaster Mage, Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and Search for Azcanta. The win condition is usually through controlling the board and eventually closing out the game with Celestial Colonnade or powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria."
