It then looks to close out the game with aggressive creatures like Legion Warboss, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Hazoret the Fervent, supported by powerful planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance. The deck uses fast mana acceleration from cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Chrome Mox to deploy threats ahead of schedule and apply pressure early in the game."
