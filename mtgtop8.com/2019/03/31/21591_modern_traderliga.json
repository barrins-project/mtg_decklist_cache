The key strategy revolves around utilizing Gifts Ungiven to search for specific cards in the deck, such as Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite, to reanimate with Unburial Rites. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Liliana of the Veil to further control the battlefield. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's plans while setting up for a game-winning play."
