It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and win the game through card advantage and efficient removal. With a mix of powerful planeswalkers, versatile removal spells, and threats that can quickly close out the game, this deck seeks to control the game and emerge victorious through strategic decision-making and resource management."
