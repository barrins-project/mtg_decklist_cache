By playing efficient low-cost creatures like Delver of Secrets and Faerie Miscreant, you can pressure your opponent early on and continue to apply pressure with the card advantage provided by Ninja of the Deep Hours. The inclusion of counterspells and removal spells like Skred and Lightning Bolt allows you to disrupt your opponent's game plan and protect your own threats. Overall, this deck aims to win through a combination of early aggression and control elements."
