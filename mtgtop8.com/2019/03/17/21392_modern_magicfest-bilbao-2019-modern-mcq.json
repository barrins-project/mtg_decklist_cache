Key cards like Teferi, Jace, and Search for Azcanta provide card advantage and control, while cards like Terminus and Supreme Verdict remove threats from the board. The deck also includes a mix of counter spells, removal spells, and card draw to maintain board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Patience and strategic decision-making are crucial for winning with this control deck."
