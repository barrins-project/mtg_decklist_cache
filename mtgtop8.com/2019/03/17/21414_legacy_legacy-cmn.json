The deck aims to cheat out big threats like Griselbrand, Grave Titan, and Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite early in the game to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures. By combining fast mana sources like Dark Ritual and Lotus Petal with strong reanimation spells, this deck can create a powerful board presence in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
