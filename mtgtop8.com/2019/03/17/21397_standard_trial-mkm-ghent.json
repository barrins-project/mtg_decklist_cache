Cards like Ajani's Pridemate and Leonin Vanguard provide extra value and flexibility, while powerful cards like History of Benalia and Conclave Tribunal help secure the win. Using aggressive strategy and efficient creatures, this deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent for a quick victory."

The deck also includes counterspells like Absorb and Negate to protect its key cards, along with card draw like Chemister's Insight to maintain card advantage. With a mixture of creature removal, hand disruption, and board wipes, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through incremental advantage and card advantage."
