            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game by using counterspells, removal spells, and board wipes to keep the opponent's threats in check. It also includes card draw and selection to help find answers and maintain card advantage. The win conditions come from planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, as well as creatures like Vendilion Clique and Celestial Colonnade. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, outvalue them with powerful spells, and ultimately secure the win through superior card advantage and control."
