            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to control the game through a combination of removal spells, counter magic, and card advantage, while using Stoneforge Mystic to find and equip powerful equipment like Batterskull and Sword of the Meek. The deck aims to stall the game with creatures like Baleful Strix and Thopter Foundry, while ultimately gaining card advantage with cards like Brainstorm and Painful Truths. Back to Basics serves as a powerful stax piece against greedy mana bases, and Supreme Verdict provides a reset button against aggressive strategies. Jace, the Mind Sculptor offers card advantage and control."
