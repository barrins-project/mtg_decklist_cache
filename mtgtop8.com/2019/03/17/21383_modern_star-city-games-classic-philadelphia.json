The deck also focuses on card advantage by using cards like Mishra's Bauble and Thought Scour to dig deeper into the deck and power up cards like Gurmag Angler and Tasigur, the Golden Fang. Additionally, the inclusion of counterspells like Stubborn Denial adds a layer of protection for your key threats. The deck aims to apply early pressure, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and close out the game quickly."

The objective is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while gradually assembling resources to win the game. Card draw and selection tools are used to find the right answers at the right time, while powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria provide additional advantage and win conditions. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's game plan and ensure consistency in casting spells."
