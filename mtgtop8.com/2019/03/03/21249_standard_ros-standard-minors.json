The deck also includes powerful cards like History of Benalia and Ajani, Adversary of Tyrants to generate value and keep the pressure up.

By using cards like Judith, the Scourge Diva and Priest of Forgotten Gods to pump up your creatures and disrupt your opponent's board, along with cards like Mortify and Ravenous Chupacabra to deal with threats, this deck aims to control the battlefield and chip away at the opponent's life total quickly. The inclusion of cards like Hunted Witness and Gutterbones provide additional synergy and resilience to the deck's strategy."
