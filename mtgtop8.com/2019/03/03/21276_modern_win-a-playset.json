Additionally, the inclusion of Leyline of Sanctity helps protect the player from targeted effects, allowing them to focus on building up their creatures and going for a quick victory."

By combining Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer with spells like Desperate Ritual and Manamorphose, the player can cast several spells in a single turn, eventually leading to a lethal Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens to finish off their opponent. Past in Flames allows the player to reuse their spells from the graveyard, creating even more explosive turns. Gifts Ungiven helps the player search for key combo pieces while disrupting their opponent's game plan."
