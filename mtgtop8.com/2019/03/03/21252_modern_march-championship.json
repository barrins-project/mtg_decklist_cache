Boros Charm provides versatility and protection, while cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze punish opponents for casting spells or deploying creatures. The mana base is carefully curated to ensure consistent access to both red and white mana sources."

Cards like Shriekhorn and Faithless Looting help to fuel the graveyard while Conflagrate can be a finisher once the graveyard is full.

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, control the board through removal and board wipes like Terminus, and eventually win through powerful late-game threats like Celestial Colonnade and Teferi's ultimate ability. The deck also includes versatile spells like Remand and Cryptic Command to stay ahead in card advantage and tempo, while also utilizing Search for Azcanta for card selection and filtering."
