The deck relies on cheap spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning to remove threats and finish off the opponent, while using cards like Delver of Secrets and Young Pyromancer to establish a board presence. The deck also utilizes cards like True-Name Nemesis and Pteramander to provide resilient threats that are difficult for the opponent to deal with. By maintaining tempo and applying constant pressure, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
