Using cards like Grapeshot and Empty the Warrens, the deck aims to finish off the opponent in one big turn. Cards like Gifts Ungiven and Past in Flames allow for card advantage and recursion, ensuring that the combo can be set up successfully. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and finish them off in a single turn."
