The deck aims to control the game until it can assemble its combo and overwhelm the opponent with a board full of Thopter tokens.

It uses powerful colorless threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to control the board and pressure the opponent. It also includes card draw and search effects like Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying to find key pieces of the deck. Removal and graveyard hate like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus help to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its powerful threats and mana advantage."
