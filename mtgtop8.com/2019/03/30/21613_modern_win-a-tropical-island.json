By utilizing cheap spells and cantrips, the deck aims to quickly flip Thing in the Ice and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and card advantage. Cards like Snapcaster Mage and Surgical Extraction are included to disrupt the opponent's game plan and keep the pressure on. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, efficient, and deadly in a 1 vs 1 Modern setting."

By cycling through creatures with high mana costs and then casting Living End, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures while simultaneously disrupting their resources with Fulminator Mage. This deck leverages a combination of graveyard manipulation and aggressive creatures to achieve victory through a well-timed combo."
