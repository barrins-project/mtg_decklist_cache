The deck aims to stall the opponent's game plan by countering their spells and removing their threats, while also drawing extra cards with cards like Ancestral Vision and Search for Azcanta. The win condition is to eventually take over the game with powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, while protecting them with counterspells and removal. The deck also has some lifegain and board wipe options to stabilize against aggressive decks."
