The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Vivien Reid and Karn, Scion of Urza to generate card advantage and pressure the opponent. Carnage Tyrant provides a resilient threat that is difficult to deal with, and Midnight Reaper ensures card draw whenever creatures die. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and value."
