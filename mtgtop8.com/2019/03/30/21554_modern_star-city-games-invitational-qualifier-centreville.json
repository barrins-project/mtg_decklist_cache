It also includes ways to search for and protect these key pieces, such as Sylvan Scrying and Relic of Progenitus. The deck aims to control the game through board wipes like Oblivion Stone and removal spells like Walking Ballista, while also presenting a fast clock with threats like Wurmcoil Engine."
