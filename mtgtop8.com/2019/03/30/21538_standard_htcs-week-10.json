Cards like Enigma Drake and Crackling Drake benefit from having a large number of instant and sorcery spells in the graveyard, while cards like Dive Down and Spell Pierce protect your creatures and spells from removal or counters. The deck aims to control the board early with burn spells like Shock and Lightning Strike, and finish off the opponent with powerful creatures like Crackling Drake."
