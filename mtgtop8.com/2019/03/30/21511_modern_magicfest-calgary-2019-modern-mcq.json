By repeatedly dredging cards into the graveyard and triggering abilities that allow for creatures to come back from the graveyard, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats. Cards like Faithless Looting and Cathartic Reunion help facilitate this strategy, while cards like Creeping Chill provide additional reach and damage potential."

The deck also includes card draw and filtering with Serum Visions and Opt to ensure consistency.
