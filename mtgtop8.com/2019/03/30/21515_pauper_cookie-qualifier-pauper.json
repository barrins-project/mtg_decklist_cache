The deck utilizes cards like Mnemonic Wall and Mulldrifter to recycle key spells like Ghostly Flicker and Freed from the Real. By combining these cards with Valakut Invoker and Pulse of Murasa, the deck aims to set up a powerful combo to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory. Lead the Stampede helps to refuel the hand and find key pieces of the combo."
