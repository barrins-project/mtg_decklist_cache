The inclusion of Rhonas the Indomitable and Ghalta, Primal Hunger provide additional threats that can close out the game quickly. With a low mana curve and efficient creatures, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The key strategy is to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and finish them off before they have a chance to stabilize. Additionally, cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish opponents for playing non-creature spells, making it difficult for them to interact with the aggro strategy. Land choices like Wooded Foothills and Arid Mesa help to ensure consistent mana for casting spells."
