This combo relies on efficiently cycling through the deck with card draw spells like Opt and Chemister's Insight, as well as protecting key pieces with counter spells like Sinister Sabotage. The win condition often involves chaining together multiple extra turns to overwhelm the opponent or to gradually increase advantage until a huge Hydroid Krasis can seal the game."
