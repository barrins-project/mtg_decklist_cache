By using cards like Light Up the Stage and Faithless Looting to draw additional cards and fill the graveyard, the player can easily bring back Arclight Phoenix from the graveyard for additional pressure. Bedlam Reveler provides card advantage in the late game, while Soul-Scar Mage, Monastery Swiftspear, and Runaway Steam-Kin helps to increase the deck's overall speed and aggressiveness."
