            "notes": "This deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's hand and board while also stealing their cards for your own advantage. By using cards like Duress, Thought Erasure, and Disinformation Campaign, you can control your opponent's resources. Thief of Sanity and Hostage Taker allow you to take control of their creatures and use them against them. The deck also includes removal spells like Vraska's Contempt and Cast Down to deal with threats. The goal is to outvalue your opponent through card advantage and tempo plays, ultimately overwhelming them with your aggressive tactics."
