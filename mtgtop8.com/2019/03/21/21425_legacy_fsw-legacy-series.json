The deck also includes a suite of cantrips like Ponder, Brainstorm, and Preordain to dig for combo pieces, along with interaction in the form of Force of Will and other counterspells. The deck prioritizes speed and explosiveness to overwhelm opponents before they have a chance to establish their board presence. Additionally, mana acceleration from cards like Lotus Petal and Ancient Tomb helps power out threats ahead of schedule."

The deck's mana base is designed to support its powerful spells and ensure consistent access to its colors."
