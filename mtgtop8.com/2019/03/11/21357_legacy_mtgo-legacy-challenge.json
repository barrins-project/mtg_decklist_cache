            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly assemble the Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage combo to create a 20/20 indestructible flying Marit Lage token. This combo can be achieved by using cards like Crop Rotation, Sylvan Scrying, and Thespian's Stage to find or copy Dark Depths. The deck also includes disruption spells like Duress and Thoughtseize to control the opponent's hand, as well as protection in the form of Pithing Needle and Sylvan Safekeeper. The deck aims to win the game quickly and decisively through a powerful combo."
