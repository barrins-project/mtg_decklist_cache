            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively play low-cost creatures like Merfolk Trickster and Pteramander, while using counter spells like Wizard's Retort and Essence Capture to protect them. Curious Obsession and Tempest Djinn are used to generate card advantage and apply pressure on the opponent. Siren Stormtamer and Dive Down help to protect key creatures from removal spells, while also maintaining tempo. The deck aims to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan while steadily building up its own threat."
