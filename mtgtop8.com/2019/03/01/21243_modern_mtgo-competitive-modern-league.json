By utilizing cards like Hollow One and Bloodghast, the deck can quickly deploy threats onto the battlefield while also disrupting the opponent's hand through cards like Burning Inquiry and Goblin Lore. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and efficient creatures, combining recursive threats with direct damage to close out the game quickly. Synergy between graveyard recursion and aggressive creatures allows for a consistent and powerful game plan."

            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly put pressure on the opponent by playing aggressive creatures like Bedlam Reveler and Young Pyromancer, while disrupting their game plan with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to deal with opposing threats. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Lingering Souls and Blood Moon adds versatility and disruption to the deck's gameplay. The deck aims to control the board early on and close out the game swiftly with a combination of creatures and burn spells."
