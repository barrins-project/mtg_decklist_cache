It uses cards like Faithless Looting and Electrodominance to set up the combo and has creatures like Monstrous Carabid and Hollow One to quickly fill the graveyard. The deck also has disruption with cards like Faerie Macabre and Urabrask the Hidden to help protect the combo and control the opponent's board."
