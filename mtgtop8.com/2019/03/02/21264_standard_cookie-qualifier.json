The key strategy is to cast multiple spells in a turn, triggering abilities like Thousand-Year Storm to copy those spells and create powerful combos. The deck also includes cards like Expansion / Explosion and Electrodominance for additional spell-casting effects. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and finish them off with a big explosion or by controlling the board with cards like Cleansing Nova and Settle the Wreckage."
