The deck aims to stall the opponent's threats and outvalue them with powerful spells like Expansion / Explosion and Chemister's Insight. Search for Azcanta helps filter through the deck for key pieces, while also flipping into a powerful card advantage engine. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game until it can outvalue and overwhelm the opponent."
