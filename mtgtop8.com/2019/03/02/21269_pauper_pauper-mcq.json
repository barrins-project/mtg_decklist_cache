By combining cheap auras like Rancor and Ethereal Armor with hexproof creatures like Slippery Bogle and Gladecover Scout, the deck aims to create large, unblockable threats early in the game. The deck also includes creature tutors like Heliod's Pilgrim to search for key auras and ramp spells like Utopia Sprawl to accelerate mana production. The goal is to apply constant pressure and win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
