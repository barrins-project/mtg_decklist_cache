The deck utilizes cards like Burning Inquiry and Goblin Lore to discard cards and draw into more threats, while also utilizing recursive creatures like Bloodghast to constantly pressure the opponent. With a mix of direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and fatal push for removal, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with both speed and power."
