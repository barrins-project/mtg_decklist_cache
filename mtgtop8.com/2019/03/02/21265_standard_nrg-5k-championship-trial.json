By using Thought Erasure to strip key cards from the opponent's hand, and cards like Mortify and Kaya's Wrath to deal with threats on the battlefield, the deck aims to dictate the pace of the game. Teferi, Hero of Dominaria provides card advantage and control with his abilities, while Search for Azcanta helps filter through the deck. The deck also includes counterspells like Absorb and Negate to protect its game plan."
