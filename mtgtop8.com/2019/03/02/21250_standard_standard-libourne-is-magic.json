            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy using low-cost creatures and efficient removal spells. By focusing on creating a wide board presence and utilizing cards like Venerated Loxodon and Benalish Marshal to boost the power of your creatures, this deck aims to quickly close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. With a mix of creatures, removal, and support spells, this deck can apply constant pressure and maintain board presence to secure victory."
