By utilizing efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, the deck aims to close out the game as quickly as possible. Additional cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze help to apply constant pressure on the opponent while cards like Light Up the Stage provide card advantage. The mana base is built to support casting spells quickly and efficiently, ensuring a fast-paced aggressive strategy."
