It aims to disrupt the opponent's hand with discard spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, while also controlling the board with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Assassin's Trophy. The deck's mana base allows for consistent casting of its powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf, Dark Confidant, and Bloodbraid Elf, while also providing access to powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil. The deck's versatility and disruption make it a formidable opponent in one-on-one games."
