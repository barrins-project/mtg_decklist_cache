            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful Eldrazi creatures and disrupt their game plan with disruptive spells like Chalice of the Void and Thorn of Amethyst. By using mana acceleration with cards like Grim Monolith and Ancient Tomb, the deck aims to deploy threats quickly and put the opponent on the back foot. The inclusion of cards like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher provide additional disruption and pressure, making it difficult for the opponent to recover once the Eldrazi creatures start hitting the battlefield."
