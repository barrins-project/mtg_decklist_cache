The deck aims to out-value opponents through incremental advantage and efficient answers, with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana of the Veil providing powerful late-game options. The mana base is designed to support the deck's curve and provide access to all necessary colors."

Rhythm of the Wild provides haste and counterspell protection to ensure your creatures hit the board safely. Lightning Bolt offers removal and burn to control the opponent's board while cards like Tireless Tracker and Bloodbraid Elf provide card advantage and additional threats. Overall, this deck focuses on mana ramp, creature deployment, and control elements to overwhelm the opponent."
