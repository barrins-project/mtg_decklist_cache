            "notes": "The deck focuses on leveraging the Human creature type to quickly overwhelm opponents with a relentless aggro strategy. By utilizing cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Champion of the Parish to pump up the team, along with disruptive creatures such as Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter, the deck aims to limit the opponent's options while maintaining a fast and powerful offense. Aether Vial allows for instant creature deployment, while Cavern of Souls ensures that key creatures can't be countered. The deck's mana base is carefully crafted to support its aggressive game plan."
