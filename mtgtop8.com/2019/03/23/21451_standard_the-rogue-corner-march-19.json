The deck includes cards that provide mana acceleration, creature synergy, and buffs to enhance the effectiveness of the creatures on the field. By maintaining a high tempo and putting pressure on the opponent early in the game, this Naya Aggro deck aims to finish the game swiftly before the opponent can stabilize or mount a successful defense."
