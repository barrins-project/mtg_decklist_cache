The deck also includes removal spells like Assassin's Trophy and Cast Down to clear the way for its creatures, as well as card advantage engines like Vivien Reid. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure that the deck can consistently hit its mana requirements and deploy threats at all stages of the game."

Experimental Frenzy provides additional card draw and mana efficiency. The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with fast creatures and burn spells to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
