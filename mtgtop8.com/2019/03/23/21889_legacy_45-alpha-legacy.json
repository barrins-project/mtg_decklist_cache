By using cards like Phyrexian Revoker and Council's Judgment, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while pushing damage with evasion creatures like Flickerwisp. The deck also utilizes powerful equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice and Umezawa's Jitte to further enhance its creatures and close out the game quickly. With a mix of disruption, aggression, and card advantage, this deck aims to control the tempo of the game and come out on top."

The deck includes various ways to protect the combo pieces such as Sylvan Safekeeper and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth to help generate mana. There are also disruption spells like Thoughtseize, Abrupt Decay, and Cabal Therapy to control the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to win the game by exploiting the synergy between Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage while maintaining control over the game with disruptive spells and protection pieces."

The main strategy is to quickly ramp into threats like Knight of the Reliquary and Woodland Bellower while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Gaddock Teeg. The deck also includes versatile options like Swords to Plowshares and Sylvan Library to adapt to different matchups. Its mana base is well-balanced to support its aggressive and disruptive game plan."
