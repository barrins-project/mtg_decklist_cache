Creatures like Slippery Bogle and Gladecover Scout can become massive threats with cards like Ethereal Armor, Daybreak Coronet, and Rancor. Leyline of Sanctity helps protect against targeted removal, while Path to Exile deals with problematic creatures. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a creature that they are unable to deal with effectively."

The deck also includes a mix of powerful lords like Supreme Phantom and Drogskol Captain to boost the team's power and toughness. Overall, the goal is to maintain early pressure and tempo to secure a win before the opponent can stabilize."

By disrupting the opponent's hand with discard spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, while also having a versatile removal package including cards like Fatal Push and Assassin's Trophy, the deck aims to control the board and push through damage with creatures like Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant. The inclusion of planeswalker Liliana of the Veil adds additional disruption and card advantage, providing the deck with a strong aggressive strategy in the Modern format."
