With a mix of efficient creatures, disruptive spells, and strong tribal synergies, the deck aims to quickly close out games before the opponent can establish a strong board presence."

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures like Pteramander and Crackling Drake, while also having removal and disruption spells like Lightning Bolt and Surgical Extraction to control the game. The inclusion of cantrips like Serum Visions and Faithless Looting helps to dig deeper into the deck and find the necessary pieces to execute the game plan effectively."
