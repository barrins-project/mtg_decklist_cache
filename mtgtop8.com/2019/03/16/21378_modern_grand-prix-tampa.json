Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful, hexproof creature."

This allows the player to cast powerful control cards like Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The deck also utilizes search cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to find key pieces, while also including versatile removal options like Oblivion Stone. The win conditions come in the form of powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, and Walking Ballista."
