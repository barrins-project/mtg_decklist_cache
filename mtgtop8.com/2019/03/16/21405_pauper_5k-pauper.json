            "notes": "This Boros aggro deck focuses on efficiently utilizing low-cost creatures and cheap removal spells to overwhelm opponents quickly. By combining aggressive creatures like Seeker of the Way and Kor Skyfisher with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to apply consistent pressure to the opponent while disrupting their game plan. Card draw engines like Prophetic Prism and Ichor Wellspring help maintain card advantage, while cards like Rally the Peasants provide a potential finisher. The mana base includes utility lands like Radiant Fountain and Mortuary Mire to help stabilize against aggressive opponents."
