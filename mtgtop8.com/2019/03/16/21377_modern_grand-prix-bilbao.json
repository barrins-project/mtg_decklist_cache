The deck utilizes cheap spells like Lightning Bolt and Faithless Looting to enable the powerful synergy between Arclight Phoenix, Pyromancer Ascension, and other graveyard recursion. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and aggressive creatures, while controlling the board with versatile cards like Thing in the Ice and Lightning Bolt. The deck aims to close out games quickly through a combination of direct damage and recursion."

Additionally, cards like Tireless Tracker and Scavenging Ooze provide extra value and help the deck stay ahead in resources. Overall, the deck aims to outpace and outvalue the opponent to secure a win."
