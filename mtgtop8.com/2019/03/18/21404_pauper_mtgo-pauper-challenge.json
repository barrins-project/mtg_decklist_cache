The deck is designed to draw through the deck quickly with cantrips like Ponder, Preordain, and Brainstorm, while protecting the combo pieces with cards like Dispel and Circular Logic. Additionally, the deck includes evasion through Shadow Rift to ensure the combo can go through unblocked. Finally, removal spells like Journey to Nowhere are included to deal with opposing threats."
