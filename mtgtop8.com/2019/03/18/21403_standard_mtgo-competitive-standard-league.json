By efficiently removing threats, countering key spells, and drawing cards, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent while generating card advantage. The inclusion of powerful threats like Nicol Bolas, the Ravager and Thief of Sanity adds pressure and alternative win conditions. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's three-color strategy, ensuring consistent access to all necessary colors of mana."
