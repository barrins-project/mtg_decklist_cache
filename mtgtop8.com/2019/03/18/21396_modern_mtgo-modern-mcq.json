The deck also includes threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Walking Ballista to stabilize the board, while also having big finishers like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Emrakul, the Promised End to close out the game. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly filling up the graveyard with spells and casting Arclight Phoenixes for a fast and aggressive playstyle. Using low-cost spells like Lava Spike and Lightning Bolt, along with efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and consistently. Cards like Faithless Looting and Manamorphose help to dig deeper into the deck and enable the Phoenixes to be cast for free from the graveyard. With a mix of burn spells and resilient creatures like Hazoret the Fervent, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
