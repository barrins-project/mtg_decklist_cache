It includes cards like Chemister's Insight and Search for Azcanta to dig for combo pieces, while also running counterspells like Sinister Sabotage for protection. The deck aims to stall the game with Root Snare until it can assemble its combo and take consecutive turns to overwhelm the opponent. It has a strong synergy between its key pieces and can quickly dominate the game once it gets going."
