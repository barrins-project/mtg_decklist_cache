By sacrificing lands and searching for copies of Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle, the player can deal massive amounts of damage to their opponent in one turn. Primeval Titan and Courser of Kruphix help to set up the combo, while cards like Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods provide removal and protection. The deck has a strong synergy between land search, ramp, and burn spells to secure victory."
