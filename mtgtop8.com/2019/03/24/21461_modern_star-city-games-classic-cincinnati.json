By utilizing cards that provide protection, disruption, and buffs for Spirit creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays while controlling the board. Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, while cards like Spell Queller and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to flood the battlefield with powerful Spirit creatures and maintain control over the game through disruption and protection."
