The deck uses a combination of tutors like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map, along with cantrips like Ancient Stirrings and Chromatic Star, to find key pieces quickly. The primary win conditions are powerful colorless threats like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Eldrazi creatures like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Emrakul, the Promised End."

It aims to stall the game with cards like Terminus and Settle the Wreckage until it can establish a dominant board presence with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. The deck includes various ways to dig for the right answers, such as Opt and Search for Azcanta, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Field of Ruin and Detention Sphere. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue and outlast the opponent in a long game."
