The deck also has a strong mana base to support its control elements and can lock the opponent out of the game with cards like Back to Basics."

It aims to protect its powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and create threats through creatures like Snapcaster Mage and Monastery Mentor. The deck also runs a light lock package with Counterbalance to control the opponent's spells. With a mix of blue and white spells, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and control the game until it can win through its own win conditions."
