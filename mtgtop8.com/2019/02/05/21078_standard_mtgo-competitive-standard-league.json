            "notes": "The deck focuses on building up resources while disrupting the opponent's strategy through counterspells and removal spells. The goal is to establish a strong board presence with powerful creatures like Frilled Mystic and Growth-Chamber Guardian, while generating card advantage with Chemister's Insight and Search for Azcanta. Wilderness Reclamation allows for explosive turns with multiple spells cast, and Expansion / Explosion can finish off the opponent or draw cards for further control. The mana base is designed to support the three-color strategy of the Temur Control archetype."
