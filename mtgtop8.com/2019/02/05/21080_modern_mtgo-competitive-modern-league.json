This control is further enhanced by using Lantern of Insight and Codex Shredder to manipulate the opponent's draws, while also ensuring you have access to key pieces with Ancient Stirrings. Finally, the deck aims to establish card advantage and recursion with Academy Ruins and Inventors' Fair while maintaining a solid mana base with cards like Mox Opal and Spire of Industry."
