Conclave Tribunal and Tajic, Legion's Edge provide removal and protection, while Heroic Reinforcements can push for a final burst of damage. The inclusion of Chance for Glory adds a risky yet potentially game-winning element to the deck. By maintaining pressure and being efficient with resources, Boros Aggro aims to overwhelm opponents and secure victory."
