By using cards like Aether Vial and Deprive to quickly deploy threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with an aggressive and tempo-based strategy. Additionally, cards like Spreading Seas help to disrupt the opponent's mana base, making it difficult for them to effectively cast their spells and defend against the Merfolk assault."
