The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's plans with cards like Terminus and Cryptic Command while establishing card advantage with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Search for Azcanta. The win condition is to slowly chip away at the opponent's life total using Celestial Colonnade and protect the board with cards like Detention Sphere and Rest in Peace. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and grind out a victory through incremental advantage."
