Additionally, the deck includes cards like Brainstorm and Predict to filter through the deck and find key cards. The inclusion of Back to Basics helps to further disrupt the opponent's mana base, while Monastery Mentor provides a win condition through generating tokens."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to establish a quick and aggressive board presence by using low-cost, efficient spells and creatures to deal damage to the opponent. It aims to apply pressure early in the game and maintain tempo by disrupting the opponent's plays with counterspells and removal spells. The deck relies on synergy between spell-based creatures such as Monastery Swiftspear and Delver of Secrets and burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning to control the pace of the game and win through fast, consistent aggression."
