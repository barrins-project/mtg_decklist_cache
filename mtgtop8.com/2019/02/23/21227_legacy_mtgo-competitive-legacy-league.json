The inclusion of cards like Sulfuric Vortex and Eidolon of the Great Revel further punishes opponents for playing non-creature spells, adding to the overall strategy of quickly reducing the opponent's life total to zero."

The key idea is to use Aether Vial to cheat Slivers into play, while also having access to countermagic in Force of Will for protection. The combination of various Sliver abilities, such as boosting power and toughness, providing evasion, and offering protection, allows the deck to apply pressure and win fast. The mana base is optimized for casting Slivers efficiently, and the inclusion of utility lands like Karakas adds versatility to the deck's game plan."
