Aether Vial helps to cheat creatures onto the battlefield quickly, while Cavern of Souls ensures that the human creatures are difficult to counter. The deck thrives on speed and synergy to win the game quickly."

Street Wraith and Bloodghast also provide additional value by coming back from the graveyard, while Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push offer removal options. Gurmag Angler and Tasigur, the Golden Fang provide additional threats in the later game. The deck aims to be aggressive and put pressure on the opponent early on to secure a quick victory."
