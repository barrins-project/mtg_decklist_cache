The inclusion of cards like Steel Overseer and Master of Etherium helps to boost the power and toughness of the creatures on the battlefield, while Galvanic Blast provides direct damage to finish off opponents. The deck's key strength lies in its ability to quickly build a threatening board presence and close out games swiftly."
