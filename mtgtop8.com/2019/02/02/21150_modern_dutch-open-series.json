Pyromancer Ascension also helps in this process. Once Arclight Phoenix is in play, it can be a powerful evasive threat with its ability to repeatedly return to the battlefield. Supporting cards like Lightning Bolt and Crackling Drake provide additional damage and control elements to help secure a quick victory in an aggressive manner."

The deck also utilizes cards like Pyromancer Ascension and Crackling Drake to further increase the power of spells and deal damage to the opponent. The deck's mana base is focused on ensuring consistent access to both red and blue mana sources for casting spells efficiently."
