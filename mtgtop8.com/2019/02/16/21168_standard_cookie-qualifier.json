By using cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Thought Erasure, you can gain an advantage in card advantage and disrupt your opponent's game plan. Kaya's Wrath and Vraska's Contempt provide efficient removal options, while Chemister's Insight and Search for Azcanta help you draw into your answers. This deck aims to stall the game until you can establish control and win through card advantage and powerful planeswalker threats."
