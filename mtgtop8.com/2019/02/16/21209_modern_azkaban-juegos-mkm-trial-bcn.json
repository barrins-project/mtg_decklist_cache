By using creatures with hexproof like Slippery Bogle and Gladecover Scout, the deck aims to protect its threats from removal spells while overwhelming the opponent with a creature that becomes increasingly difficult to deal with. The auras also provide additional benefits such as boosts to power and toughness, lifelink, and protection from specific colors. Ultimately, the deck's goal is to beat down the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."

The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent and overwhelm them with direct damage and fast creatures, staying one step ahead and closing out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
