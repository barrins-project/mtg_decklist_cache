This combo is supported by Search for Azcanta to filter through the deck, Teferi, Hero of Dominaria for card advantage and control, and Dovin, Grand Arbiter for additional card draw and stabilizing the board. Settle the Wreckage provides a board wipe option, while Chart a Course and Chemister's Insight offer additional card draw. Cleansing Nova acts as a potential board wipe against aggressive decks."

Niv-Mizzet, Parun serves as a powerful finisher, providing additional reach and card advantage to close out the game."

The deck also incorporates card advantage with Midnight Reaper and Find / Finality, and finishes off with powerful top-end threats like Lyra Dawnbringer and Carnage Tyrant. Overall, the strategy revolves around quick and efficient creature-based aggression backed up by removal and resilience."
