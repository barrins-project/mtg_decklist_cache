Drogskol Captain synergizes well with the other spirits, providing them with hexproof and making them more difficult to deal with.

By playing cards like Lightning Bolt, Searing Blaze, and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react defensively. The deck also includes cards like Boros Charm and Eidolon of the Great Revel to maximize damage output and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a focus on quick, efficient damage, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize and take control."
