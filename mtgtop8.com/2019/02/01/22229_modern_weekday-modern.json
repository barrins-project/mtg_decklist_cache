It utilizes cards like Street Wraith, Horror of the Broken Lands, and Monstrous Carabid to cycle through the deck, while also disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Faerie Macabre and Fulminator Mage. By efficiently cycling through the deck and casting Living End, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent with a board full of powerful creatures."
