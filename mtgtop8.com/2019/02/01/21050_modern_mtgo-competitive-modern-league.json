By using rituals and cantrips, the deck aims to cast multiple spells in one turn, eventually chaining into a lethal Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens to win the game. Gifts Ungiven provides flexibility in finding key combo pieces, while Past in Flames allows for a powerful graveyard recursion. The key strategy is to efficiently cycle through the deck, generate a critical mass of spells, and finish off the opponent in one explosive turn."
