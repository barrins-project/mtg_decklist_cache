The goal is to establish a loop where you can continuously cast Nexus of Fate and eventually overwhelm your opponent with card advantage and extra turns. The deck also includes cards like Search for Azcanta and Chemister's Insight to help filter through your deck and find the cards you need to execute your combo. The key strategy is to stall the game with Root Snare and disrupt your opponent's plans while you set up your combo."
