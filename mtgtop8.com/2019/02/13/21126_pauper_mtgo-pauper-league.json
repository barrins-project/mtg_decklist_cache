The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining a strong board presence, allowing it to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent. The deck's versatility comes from its ability to switch between aggressive and controlling strategies based on the matchup, giving it a strong advantage in a variety of scenarios."
