It uses cycling creatures like Curator of Mysteries and Striped Riverwinder to fill the graveyard quickly, while also utilizing cards like As Foretold to cast spells for free. The deck also includes counter spells like Cryptic Command to protect the combo. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a sudden surge of creatures from the graveyard, while controlling the game with counters and removal spells."
