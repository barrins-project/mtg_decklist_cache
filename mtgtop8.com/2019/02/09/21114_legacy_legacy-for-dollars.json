The deck also has access to powerful removal in the form of Punishing Fire and Engineered Explosives. Overall, the strategy is to outlast and outvalue the opponent while slowly building towards a win condition using land-based synergies."

The deck can lock down the opponent's mana base with Back to Basics and finish the game with powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels.
