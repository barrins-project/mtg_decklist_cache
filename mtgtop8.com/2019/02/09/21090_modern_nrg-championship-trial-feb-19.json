The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of aggressive creatures like Champion of the Parish and Mantis Rider, supported by anthem effects like Thalia's Lieutenant. The deck's mana base is carefully constructed to support the Human tribal theme."

The inclusion of Snapcaster Mage allows for flexibility in using instants and sorceries from the graveyard, while cards like Mishra's Bauble help to enable the Death's Shadow strategy. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain control throughout the game."

Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, giving you a competitive edge in the early game."
