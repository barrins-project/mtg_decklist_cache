By dredging cards like Stinkweed Imp and Golgari Thug, the deck can bring back key threats like Prized Amalgam and Bloodghast from the graveyard. The goal is to create a recursive engine that overwhelms the opponent with a steady stream of threats. Creeping Chill provides reach and helps close out the game. The key is to efficiently dredge cards while managing resources effectively."
