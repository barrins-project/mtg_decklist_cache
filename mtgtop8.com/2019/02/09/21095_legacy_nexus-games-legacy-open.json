It utilizes cards like Shardless Agent and Tarmogoyf to quickly establish a board presence, while also employing disruption in the form of Hymn to Tourach and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's plans. The deck also has access to powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana of the Veil to provide additional value and control. Overall, the deck aims to win through a combination of aggression and control elements."
