Collected Company and Aether Vial are key to generating value and maintaining pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to close out games quickly by overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of powerful Spirit creatures, supported by disruptive spells like Path to Exile and Remorseful Cleric. Spirit synergies and tribal support cards enhance the overall game plan."

The strategy revolves around maintaining pressure with efficient creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, while also utilizing burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike to finish off the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early in the game, forcing them to react defensively or risk falling behind in the race to reduce their life total to zero."
