By protecting these creatures with spells like Dive Down and countering opponent's plays with cards like Spell Pierce and Wizard's Retort, the deck aims to maintain control of the battlefield while drawing extra cards with Curious Obsession. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast tempo and disruptive tactics while maintaining a solid defense."
