By efficiently cycling through the deck with cantrips and card draw spells, the deck aims to assemble the necessary pieces for a game-winning storm turn."

With the ability to search for UrzaTron lands and other key cards using Expedition Map and Ancient Stirrings, the deck can consistently set up its win condition and outvalue the opponent."

It aims to stabilize the board with board wipes like Terminus and Supreme Verdict, while using planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria to generate card advantage and control the game. The deck also includes efficient removal spells like Path to Exile and Cryptic Command to deal with threats. Additionally, Search for Azcanta helps filter through the deck and find important spells."
