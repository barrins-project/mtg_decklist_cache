It also utilizes cheap spells and cantrips to maintain card advantage and fuel the graveyard recursion. The deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent early in the game with aggressive creatures like Young Pyromancer and Crackling Drake, while also having removal spells to control the board. The key is to efficiently use cards like Faithless Looting and Manamorphose to bring back Arclight Phoenix and transform Thing in the Ice for a strong finish."
