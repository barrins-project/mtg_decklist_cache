The mana base is constructed to support the deck's three-color identity, with fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistency in casting spells. The main goal is to control the game until the late game where the deck can take over and win."

By playing cards like Tarmogoyf, Dark Confidant, and Scavenging Ooze alongside removal spells such as Lightning Bolt and Assassin's Trophy, the deck looks to keep up the pressure while disrupting the opponent's game plan. Liliana of the Veil and hand disruption like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek help to clear the way for aggressive plays. The mana base is optimized to support the deck's aggressive game plan while also ensuring consistency in casting its spells."
