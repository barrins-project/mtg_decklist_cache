The deck aims to reduce its own life total quickly to make Death's Shadow larger and more difficult to deal with. It also includes a mix of efficient creatures and spells, such as Tarmogoyf, Wild Nacatl, and Temur Battle Rage, to apply early pressure and close out the game quickly. The deck also utilizes disruption and card draw with Thoughtseize and Mishra's Bauble to maintain control of the game."
