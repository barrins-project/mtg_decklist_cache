Utilizing cards like Life from the Loam to continually dredge through your deck, you can quickly fill up your graveyard with creatures and hit your opponent for massive damage with cards like Creeping Chill. The aim is to overwhelm your opponent with a fast and aggressive graveyard-based strategy that can be difficult to combat once it gets going."
