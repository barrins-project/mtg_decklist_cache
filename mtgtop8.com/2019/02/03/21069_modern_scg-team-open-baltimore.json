Snapcaster Mage and Mishra's Bauble provide card advantage while Temur Battle Rage can help you deliver lethal damage. Stubborn Denial offers protection for your creatures and can counter key spells. Overall, this deck aims to apply pressure early and control the game with its disruptive elements."
