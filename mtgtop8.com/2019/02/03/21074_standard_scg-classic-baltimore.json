By utilizing cards like Wildgrowth Walker and Merfolk Branchwalker to gain life and card advantage, along with threats like Carnage Tyrant and Hostage Taker, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggression and resilience. The inclusion of versatile planeswalkers like Vivien Reid and Karn, Scion of Urza allows for additional card advantage and flexibility in managing different matchups. Ultimately, the goal is to maintain a strong board presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
