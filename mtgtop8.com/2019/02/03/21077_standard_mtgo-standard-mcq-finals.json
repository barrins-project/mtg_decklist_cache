It looks to set up Niv-Mizzet, Parun as a win condition, along with Star of Extinction to clear the board. The deck aims to stay ahead of the opponent by constantly having answers to threats and setting up big plays with cards like Precognitive Perception. It utilizes a mix of burn spells and counterspells to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain control of the match."
