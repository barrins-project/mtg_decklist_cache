By protecting the creature with Leyline of Sanctity and other auras, it can quickly deal a lot of damage to the opponent while being difficult to remove. With a mix of offensive and defensive auras, it aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to react. With a mix of ramp cards and efficient spell choices, the deck is designed to be fast and consistent in delivering lethal blows."
