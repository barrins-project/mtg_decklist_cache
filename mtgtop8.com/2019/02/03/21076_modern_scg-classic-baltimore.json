The deck also includes a mix of sweepers like Supreme Verdict and Settle the Wreckage to deal with wide board states. The win condition revolves around controlling the game until late game, where powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi can take over the game."

The deck also utilizes disruptive cards like Chalice of the Void and Dismember to control the game and ensure your Eldrazi creatures can dominate the battlefield. By combining aggro strategies with powerful Eldrazi creatures, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast, hard-hitting threats while also disrupting their game plan."
