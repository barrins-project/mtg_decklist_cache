The deck aims to establish early board control with creatures like Siren Stormtamer and Merfolk Trickster while delivering quick damage with evasive creatures like Pteramander and Tempest Djinn. The inclusion of Curious Obsession adds card draw and increased pressure. Overall, the deck aims to apply consistent pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan."

The deck focuses on generating token creatures with cards like Deeproot Waters and Benthic Biomancer, and then pumping those tokens up with cards like Deeproot Elite and Merfolk Mistbinder. This creates a powerful and efficient board presence that can quickly overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes some disruptive elements with Merfolk Trickster to disrupt the opponent's plans and control the board. Overall, the deck aims to establish a dominant position on the battlefield and quickly finish off the opponent."
