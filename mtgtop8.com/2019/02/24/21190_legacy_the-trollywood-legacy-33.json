The deck also utilizes efficient creatures like True-Name Nemesis and Delver of Secrets to apply pressure while disrupting opponents' strategies with cards like Spell Pierce and Daze. With a mix of card advantage from Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, the deck aims to outvalue opponents and grind out wins by controlling the game and tempo."
