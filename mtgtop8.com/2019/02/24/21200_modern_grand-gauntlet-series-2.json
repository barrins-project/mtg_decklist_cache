Additionally, cards like Surgical Extraction and Maximize Velocity provide additional utility and ways to push through damage. The mana base consists of fetchlands and shocklands to ensure consistent mana fixing for the aggressive game plan."

It utilizes cards like Chalice of the Void and Blood Moon to control the board and slow down the opponent's game plan. Ensnaring Bridge prevents attacks from creatures, while cards like Goblin Rabblemaster and Legion Warboss provide pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance for additional card advantage and removal. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and win through efficient threats and disruption."
