The deck includes various card draw spells and cantrips to dig through the deck quickly, along with Pentad Prism and Lotus Bloom to generate additional mana. Spoils of the Vault can be used to find key combo pieces, while Pact of Negation provides protection when going off. The deck aims to win in one explosive turn and is focused on minimizing interaction from the opponent."

Additionally, the deck uses Search for Azcanta for card advantage and filtering, while also having threats like Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet and Tasigur, the Golden Fang for board presence. The deck is capable of controlling the game until it can establish a strong board presence with its threats, ultimately winning through attrition and card advantage."

Use synergy between cards like Expedition Map, Ancient Stirrings, and Sylvan Scrying to find key pieces and maintain control over the game with removal like Oblivion Stone and Karn Liberated. Additionally, include graveyard hate with Relic of Progenitus to disrupt opponent's strategies. Ultimately, overwhelm opponents with massive threats and efficient control elements to secure victory in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."
