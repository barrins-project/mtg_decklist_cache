This enables Arclight Phoenix to be cast for free and return to the battlefield multiple times, putting pressure on the opponent. Pyromancer Ascension also helps in generating value from casting multiple spells in a turn. Crackling Drake provides additional threats, while Lightning Bolt and Gut Shot support the aggressive game plan. Overall, the deck aims to be a fast and potent aggro deck in the Modern format."
