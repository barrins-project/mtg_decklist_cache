Mana acceleration from cards like Noble Hierarch and Invigorate help fuel the combo, while disruption spells like Force of Will and Daze provide defense against opponent's strategies. The deck aims to win within a few turns by aggressively attacking with infect creatures while countering opponent's threats."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the board through counterspells, removal, and card advantage. Key cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Snapcaster Mage allow for card advantage and manipulation, while cards like Terminus and Swords to Plowshares provide removal options. Counterbalance helps to disrupt the opponent's plans by countering spells, while cards like Force of Will offer another form of protection. Back to Basics can also shut down opponents relying on nonbasic lands. Overall, the deck aims to outlast opponents through control and strategic decision-making."
