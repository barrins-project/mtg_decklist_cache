By utilizing cards like Legion's Landing and History of Benalia to consistently generate tokens, along with powerful anthem effects like Benalish Marshal, the deck aims to build a wide board presence and push for lethal damage in the early game. Conclave Tribunal provides removal options for pesky threats, while Unbreakable Formation helps protect the board and finish off the opponent. Overall, the strategy revolves around aggressive, fast-paced gameplay to secure victory."

By utilizing cards that generate value upon entering the battlefield and disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Hostage Taker and Vraska's Contempt, this deck aims to control the board and overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats. The inclusion of cards like Hydroid Krasis and Find / Finality also provides card advantage and resilience against removal spells, allowing the deck to maintain its aggressive momentum."
