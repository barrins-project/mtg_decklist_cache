Once enough lands are on the battlefield, the goal is to play Primeval Titan to search for Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and multiple Mountain cards to deal massive damage to the opponent. To protect against aggressive strategies, Platinum Emperion and Obstinate Baloth provide some life gain and resilience. Madcap Experiment can also be used to cheat out Platinum Emperion for a surprise defense."

The inclusion of cards like Mishra's Bauble and Thought Scour enable card advantage and graveyard manipulation, while Snapcaster Mage provides versatility in reusing key spells. Overall, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats while maintaining control of the game."

By using cards such as Creeping Chill and Conflagrate, the deck can also deal significant damage to the opponent while maintaining a strong board presence. The synergy between dredge cards and graveyard recursion allows for explosive plays and overwhelming aggression."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly dealing damage to the opponent through low-cost, efficient burn spells and aggressive creatures. By efficiently using cards like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Lava Spike, the goal is to keep the pressure on the opponent and win the game before they can set up their own strategy. Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide provide early pressure, while Eidolon of the Great Revel punishes the opponent for casting spells. With a focus on speed and direct damage, this deck aims to win the game as quickly as possible."
