The goal is to apply pressure early on and force the opponent to react, while also having some versatility with cards like Boros Charm and Lightning Helix for direct damage or protection. The deck's mana base is designed to support these aggressive strategies with a mix of fetch lands and dual lands."

The deck aims to consistently put pressure on the opponent early in the game and finish them off with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Rift Bolt. The key strategy is to maintain a fast pace and overwhelming offensive presence, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize and recover."
