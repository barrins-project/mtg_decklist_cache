            "notes": "This deck focuses on using a combination of early game ramp with cards like Llanowar Elves and Incubation Druid, along with powerful mid-game threats like Wildgrowth Walker and Hydroid Krasis to apply pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Hostage Taker and Carnage Tyrant to control the board and protect its key creatures. Utilizing a mix of removal spells like Vraska's Contempt and Cast Down, along with versatile cards like Find / Finality, the deck aims to maintain board presence and outvalue the opponent through efficient creature plays and card advantage."
