The deck also includes counter spells like Force of Will, as well as Counterbalance, to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck runs card selection spells like Brainstorm and Ponder to set up powerful plays."

The deck also aims to control the board with cards like Ensnaring Bridge while utilizing fast mana sources like Ancient Tomb and Simian Spirit Guide to deploy threats quickly. Fiery Confluence and Chalice of the Void are also key cards in disrupting the opponent's game plan."
