Aether Vial provides flexibility in deploying creatures at instant speed, while mana-fixing lands like Unclaimed Territory and Cavern of Souls ensure that the deck's multicolored creatures can be cast easily. Overall, the deck's strategy revolves around a fast and disruptive aggro game plan fueled by synergistic Human creatures."
