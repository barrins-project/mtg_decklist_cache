Utilizing cards like Negate, Syncopate, Absorb, Seal Away, and Settle the Wreckage to control the board while also ramping up mana with Wilderness Reclamation and Growth Spiral. Teferi, Hero of Dominaria provides additional card advantage and board control, while Hydroid Krasis and Angel of Grace serve as win conditions and additional ways to gain life. Frilled Mystic provides a powerful, flexible counterspell option. The deck seeks to establish and maintain control until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful creatures and card advantage."
