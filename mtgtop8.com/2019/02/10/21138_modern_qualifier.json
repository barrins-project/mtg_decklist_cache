The deck also includes various card draw and selection spells like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to help dig for combo pieces.

The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Maelstrom Pulse and Assassin's Trophy, while utilizing cards like Mishra's Bauble and Thought Scour to cycle through the deck and find key pieces. The inclusion of Stubborn Denial and Whispers of Emrakul provide additional disruption and protection, allowing the deck to maintain pressure and close out games quickly."
