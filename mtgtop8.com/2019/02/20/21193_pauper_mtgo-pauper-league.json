The deck also includes ways to generate card advantage with Thraben Inspector and Battle Screech, as well as ways to protect your creatures with Prismatic Strands. Additionally, the deck has some reach with Rally the Peasants to close out games quickly. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and efficient removal spells."
