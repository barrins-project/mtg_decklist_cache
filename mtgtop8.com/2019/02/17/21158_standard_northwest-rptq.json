            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively reduce the opponent's life total as quickly as possible. It focuses on casting efficient burn spells like Skewer the Critics, Wizard's Lightning, Shock, and Lightning Strike to deal direct damage to the opponent and their creatures. The deck also utilizes creatures like Goblin Chainwhirler, Runaway Steam-Kin, Ghitu Lavarunner, and Viashino Pyromancer to apply additional pressure and deal damage. Additionally, cards like Experimental Frenzy and Light Up the Stage allow the player to maintain card advantage and continue the aggression."
