The deck aims to control the board and close out games quickly with evasive threats."

Protection spells like Blossoming Defense and Vines of Vastwood help to keep the infect creatures safe while also countering opponent's removal spells. The deck aims to win the game by reaching 10 poison counters before the opponent can deplete the player's life total."

This allows the player to search for multiple land cards, including utility lands like Boros Garrison and Khalni Garden, to set up a powerful board state. The deck also includes cards like Summoner's Pact to find key creatures and Engineered Explosives to deal with threats. With the right setup, this deck can generate a lot of mana and overwhelm opponents with big creatures and powerful land synergies."
