By utilizing Entomb and Careful Study to put powerful creatures like Griselbrand, Jin-Gitaxias, and Iona into your graveyard, you can then bring them back for a fraction of their mana cost. The deck also includes control elements like Force of Will and Daze to protect your combo pieces. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with large, game-changing creatures early in the game."
