The deck also utilizes graveyard hate with cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Scavenging Ooze to prevent opponents from utilizing their own resources. With a mix of disruption, threats, and graveyard hate, this Golgari Aggro deck aims to apply pressure and control the game from the early stages to come out on top."
