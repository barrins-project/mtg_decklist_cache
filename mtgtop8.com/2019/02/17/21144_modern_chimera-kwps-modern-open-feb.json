            "notes": "This Golgari Aggro deck focuses on early disruption with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, followed by efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Assassin's Trophy. The deck also utilizes cards like Grim Flayer and Tarmogoyf to apply pressure on the opponent while also generating card advantage. Traverse the Ulvenwald helps to find key pieces of the deck, while Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption. The deck aims to establish board presence quickly and overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive creatures and versatile removal spells."
