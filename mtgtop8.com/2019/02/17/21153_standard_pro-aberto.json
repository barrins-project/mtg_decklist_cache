By establishing a quick board presence and continually applying pressure, the deck aims to control the battlefield and chip away at the opponent's life total before they have a chance to stabilize. Cards like History of Benalia and Legion's Landing provide additional benefits for going wide with small creatures, while Deputy of Detention and Conclave Tribunal offer removal options to clear the way for an aggressive assault."
