This allows the player to cast and recur powerful spell cards such as Mulldrifter, Stonehorn Dignitary, and Mnemonic Wall. The deck utilizes control elements like Prohibit, Moment's Peace, and Compulsive Research to stall the opponent and outvalue them in the late game. The combination of card advantage and mana ramping makes this deck a formidable control archetype in the Pauper format."
