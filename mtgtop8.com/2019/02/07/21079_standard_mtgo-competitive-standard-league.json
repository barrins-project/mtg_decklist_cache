Additionally, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with efficient removal spells such as Cast Down and Ravenous Chupacabra, while finishing them off with powerful finishers like Carnage Tyrant and Find / Finality. The deck also has some utility with cards like Vivien Reid and Hadana's Climb, providing additional value and ways to close out games."
