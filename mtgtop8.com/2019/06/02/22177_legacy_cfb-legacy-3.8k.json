The goal is to assemble a critical mass of storm count to cast Tendrils of Agony, either directly or through Burning Wish, to deal lethal damage to the opponent in one turn. The deck includes disruption spells like Duress and Thoughtseize to protect the combo, as well as Past in Flames for recursion. Overall, it aims to generate a high storm count and win the game through a powerful storm combo."
