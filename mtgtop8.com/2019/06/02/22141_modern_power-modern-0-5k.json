This allows the player to cast powerful colorless spells like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, Oblivion Stone, and Karn Liberated to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes artifact cards like Expedition Map and Relic of Progenitus to further support its control strategy and provide additional utility. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue and outlast the opponent with powerful threats and disruption."

With efficient removal options like Path to Exile and Supreme Verdict, as well as card advantage from cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, the deck looks to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent to secure victory."
