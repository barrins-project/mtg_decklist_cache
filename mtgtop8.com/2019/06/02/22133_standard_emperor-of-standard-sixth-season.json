Rix Maadi Reveler and Legion Warboss help maintain card advantage and create tokens to further pressure the opponent. Removal spells like Lightning Strike, Bedevil, and Lava Coil help clear the way for your creatures to attack. Rekindling Phoenix provides a resilient threat that can come back from the graveyard. Rakdos Firewheeler adds a bit of disruption to the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and finish off the opponent quickly."
