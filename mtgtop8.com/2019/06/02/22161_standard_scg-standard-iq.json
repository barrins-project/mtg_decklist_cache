By utilizing cards like Goblin Chainwhirler, Viashino Pyromancer, and Runaway Steam-Kin, the deck aims to deal damage to the opponent as fast as possible. The inclusion of powerful burn spells like Lightning Strike, Shock, and Skewer the Critics also ensures that the opponent's life total diminishes rapidly. Additionally, cards like Experimental Frenzy and Chandra, Fire Artisan provide card advantage and additional ways to pressure the opponent."
