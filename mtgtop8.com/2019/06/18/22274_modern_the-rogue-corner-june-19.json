The deck also utilizes Treasure Hunt to draw a large number of cards and potentially find more lands to discard with Seismic Assault. The mana base is heavily focused on red sources to support the deck's key combo pieces and allow for consistent plays. Overall, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces to overwhelm the opponent with direct damage."
