            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly build up storm count and combo off with Tendrils of Agony for a lethal finish. This is achieved by using fast mana acceleration cards like Chrome Mox, Lion's Eye Diamond, and Lotus Petal, along with powerful draw and graveyard manipulation effects such as Brainstorm, Entomb, and Echo of Eons. Monastery Mentor provides additional tokens for extra storm count, while Narset, Parter of Veils disrupts the opponent's card advantage. Cabal Therapy and Thoughseize help disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect the combo."
