The inclusion of cards like Karn, Scion of Urza and Karakas provide additional versatility and protection, making it a well-rounded aggro-affinity deck in the Legacy format."

The deck also includes cards like Sneak Attack to cheat creatures into play and win the game quickly. The deck also includes counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect the combo, as well as cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder to dig for combo pieces. The goal is to quickly put out a game-winning threat and overpower the opponent."
