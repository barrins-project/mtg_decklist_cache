It also includes powerful control and removal spells like Karn, the Great Creator and Oblivion Stone to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck can quickly ramp into high mana cost threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, while also able to search for specific lands or artifacts with cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map. Additionally, the deck has graveyard hate with Relic of Progenitus to deal with graveyard strategies."
