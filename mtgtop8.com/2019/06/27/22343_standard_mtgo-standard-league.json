By playing cards like Liliana, Nicol Bolas, and Narset, along with efficient removal spells like Bedevil and Cry of the Carnarium, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent while disrupting their game plan with counterspells like Negate. The deck's mana base is carefully constructed to support its powerful spells and enable smooth gameplay."
