The deck also utilizes cards like Opt and Chart a Course to dig for key pieces, along with Finale of Promise to cast multiple spells in a turn. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive playstyle with plenty of Islands and Mountains alongside dual lands like Steam Vents and Sulfur Falls."
