The deck utilizes tutors like Expedition Map and Ancient Stirrings to find the necessary Tron lands and threats quickly, while also having access to Karn, the Great Creator to shut down artifact-centric strategies."

The inclusion of Primeval Titan and Zacama, Primal Calamity offers additional threats and utility, while cards like Courser of Kruphix provide card advantage and help with deck thinning. Overall, the deck aims to win through a combination of ramping, comboing off with Valakut, and overwhelming the opponent with powerful creatures."
