By consistently casting burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Fireblast, while also triggering cards like Curse of the Pierced Heart and Thermo-Alchemist, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. With a focus on aggressive play and constant pressure, the Aggro-Burn archetype aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize or mount a counter-offensive."
