This allows the deck to play powerful control cards like Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to dominate the game and eventually win with powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The deck also utilizes artifacts like Relic of Progenitus and Oblivion Stone for disruption and removal."

            "notes": "This deck relies on controlling the game by using artifacts and counterspells to disrupt the opponent's strategy while generating value with Urza, Lord High Artificer and the Thopter Foundry/Sword of the Meek combo. It also includes versatile cards like Whir of Invention and Cryptic Command to further control the board and protect key pieces. The land base is focused on providing color sources and utility lands like Field of Ruin and Inventors' Fair. The archetype leverages the synergy between artifacts and control elements to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a battle of wits."
