The deck aims to be aggressive and burst down the opponent with burn spells and flying creatures, while also having access to disruptive elements like Surgical Extraction. The key strategy is to efficiently cycle through the deck, maximize the use of instants and sorceries, and overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and creatures."

This enables the player to cast Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis for cheap and bring back multiple creatures from the graveyard. Altar of Dementia and Bridge from Below provide additional synergy by milling cards and creating zombie tokens. With a strong focus on graveyard recursion and creature synergy, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful combo."

The deck focuses on quickly assembling the UrzaTron lands to cast big threats like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Wurmcoil Engine. It also includes cards like Relic of Progenitus and Oblivion Stone to disrupt opponent's strategies and maintain control of the board. Overall, the deck's key concept revolves around efficient mana production and powerful threats to outvalue the opponent in the mid to late game."
