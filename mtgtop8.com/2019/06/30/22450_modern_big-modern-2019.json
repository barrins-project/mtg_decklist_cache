This is complemented by cards like Crypt Incursion for lifegain and Ensnaring Bridge for defense. The deck aims to disrupt and control the opponent's game plan by emptying their library, ultimately leading to their defeat by running out of cards to draw. The inclusion of cards like Visions of Beyond and Mission Briefing helps to maintain card advantage and consistency in executing the mill strategy."
