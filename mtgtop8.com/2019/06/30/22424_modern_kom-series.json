            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to generate storm count with efficient spells like Pyretic Ritual and Desperate Ritual, while using cards like Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer to reduce costs. Utilizing cards such as Gifts Ungiven to search for combo pieces like Grapeshot and Past in Flames, the goal is to generate enough spells to cast a lethal Grapeshot, or to generate enough mana to flashback powerful spells with Past in Flames. The deck aims to efficiently cycle through the deck with cantrips like Sleight of Hand and Serum Visions to find key pieces and assemble the combo for a win."
