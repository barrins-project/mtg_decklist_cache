By utilizing cards like Teferi, Narset, and Hero of Precinct One, the deck aims to establish board control and prevent the opponent from developing their own game plan. With a mix of counterspells, removal, and card advantage engines, the deck can outlast aggressive strategies and grind out wins in longer games. The strategy revolves around denying the opponent resources and overwhelming them with the deck's powerful threats."

The deck focuses on removing threats from the opponent's side of the board while generating card advantage and incremental advantages with planeswalker abilities. By disrupting the opponent's game plan and continually generating value with planeswalker abilities, the deck aims to outpace and outvalue the opponent until it can establish a dominant board presence and close out the game."
