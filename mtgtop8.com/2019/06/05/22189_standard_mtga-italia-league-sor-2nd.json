The deck focuses on playing powerful creatures like Rekindling Phoenix, Gruul Spellbreaker, and Nullhide Ferox early on to deal quick damage to the opponent. Additionally, cards like Rhythm of the Wild and Domri's Ambush help support the aggressive nature of the deck by providing additional buffs and removal spells. The inclusion of high-powered creatures like Ilharg, the Raze-Boar and Ghalta, Primal Hunger also helps ensure a strong late-game presence."
