The deck aims to stall the game with its removal spells like Path to Exile and Supreme Verdict, while utilizing cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to generate card advantage and control the opponent's actions. The deck also has a strong mana base to support its multicolor spells and utility lands for further disruption."
