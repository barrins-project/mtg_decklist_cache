The deck also utilizes Karn, the Great Creator to shut down opposing artifacts and mana sources, while Monastery Mentor helps to generate additional tokens for aggression. Chalice of the Void is used to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while the Mishra's and Urza's Baubles provide card draw and deck manipulation. The deck aims to win quickly and efficiently through its combo pieces."
