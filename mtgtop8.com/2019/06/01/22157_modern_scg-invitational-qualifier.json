By playing creatures like Champion of the Parish and Thalia's Lieutenant, the deck aims to build a strong board presence early on. Cards like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter disrupt the opponent's strategy, while Aether Vial helps cheat creatures into play. With a mix of disruptive elements and efficient attackers, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent and close out the game quickly."
