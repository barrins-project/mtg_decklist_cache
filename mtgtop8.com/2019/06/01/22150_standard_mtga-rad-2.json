The deck also aims to generate value through cards like Vraska, Golgari Queen and Vivien Reid, and can quickly close out games with powerful finishers like Bolas's Citadel. Overall, the deck focuses on applying pressure early and maintaining control of the game through a combination of aggression and disruption."
