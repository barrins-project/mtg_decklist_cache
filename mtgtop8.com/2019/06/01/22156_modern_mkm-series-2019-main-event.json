Creeping Chill provides additional reach and Conflagrate can help deal with threats on the opponent's side of the board. Life from the Loam ensures a steady stream of land drops while also supporting the deck's graveyard strategy. Overall, this deck aims to win through explosive graveyard shenanigans and synergy."
