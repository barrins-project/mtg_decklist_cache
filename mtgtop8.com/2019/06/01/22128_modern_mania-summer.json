The deck also includes control elements like Ensnaring Bridge and Fatal Push to protect itself while milling. Additionally, Snapcaster Mage and Mission Briefing provide recursion for key spells, while Surgical Extraction can disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of mill and control elements to secure victory."
