The deck also aims to control the board with cards like Carnage Tyrant and Stormbreath Dragon, while also dealing direct damage with Lightning Bolt. The inclusion of Blood Moon further disrupts the opponent's mana base. The deck's win condition is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures like Inferno Titan and Tireless Tracker."
