The key strategy is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures equipped with Cranial Plating, while also being able to utilize burn spells like Galvanic Blast for additional reach. The deck is able to generate a lot of mana quickly with Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, allowing for explosive plays and potentially ending the game in just a few turns."
