            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly deploying cheap artifact creatures and using them alongside powerful artifact-enhancing spells to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays. By utilizing the synergies between artifacts and cards like Atog and Fling, the deck can create explosive turns and put immense pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes card draw and disruption elements to help ensure a consistent game plan and disrupt the opponent's strategies. Overall, this deck aims to quickly build a wide board presence and close out the game in a fast and efficient manner."
