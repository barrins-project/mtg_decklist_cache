It achieves this by using cards like Pulse of Murasa, Reap and Sow, and Mwonvuli Acid-Moss to gain life, destroy lands, and disrupt the opponent's mana base. The deck also focuses on ramping up mana with cards like Explore, Sakura-Tribe Scout, and Sylvan Ranger, allowing for more powerful plays in the later stages of the game. Overall, the strategy is to control the board and outvalue the opponent with card advantage and resource disruption."
