It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy, protect its own threats, and generate card advantage through card draw and graveyard manipulation. The deck aims to stabilize the board with efficient removal and sweepers, while out-valuing the opponent with powerful planeswalkers like Teferi and Jace. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and enable a smooth curve of spells from the early game to the late game."

It utilizes cards like Utopia Sprawl and Birds of Paradise to ramp into threats such as Vengevine, Inferno Titan, and Glorybringer. Magus of the Moon disrupts opponents' mana bases, while Goblin Rabblemaster and Bloodbraid Elf provide additional pressure. Domri, Anarch of Bolas and Domri, Chaos Bringer provide card advantage and support for the aggressive strategy. The deck aims to quickly establish a board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
