The key strategy is to create a powerful board presence through graveyard recursion and sacrifice outlets like Carrion Feeder, leading to high damage output and potentially winning the game in just a few turns. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and explosive combo that can be difficult to stop once it gets going."
