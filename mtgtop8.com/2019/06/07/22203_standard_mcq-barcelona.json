The deck focuses on quick, efficient damage output through cards like Viashino Pyromancer, Goblin Chainwhirler, and Demanding Dragon. It also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Sarkhan the Masterless and Angrath to provide additional threats and disruption. The mana base is designed to support the three color requirements of the deck while allowing for consistent, proactive plays. Overall, the goal of this Jund Aggro deck is to apply pressure early and maintain control of the board throughout the game."

By utilizing fast mana acceleration with cards like Llanowar Elves and Shock, the deck aims to quickly establish board presence and deal significant damage early in the game. Key cards like Rekindling Phoenix and Skarrgan Hellkite provide additional threats that are difficult to deal with, while cards like Domri, Anarch of Bolas and The Immortal Sun offer support and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and finish the game before the opponent can stabilize."
