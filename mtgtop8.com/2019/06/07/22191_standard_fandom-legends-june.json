Runaway Steam-Kin powers up as you cast red spells, allowing for explosive turns. Experimental Frenzy lets you cast cards from the top of your library, maintaining a steady stream of threats. Chandra, Fire Artisan provides additional burn damage and card advantage. Overall, the strategy is to be aggressive and finish off the opponent before they can stabilize."
