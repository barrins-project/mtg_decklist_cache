By utilizing cards like Leonin Arbiter and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to tax the opponent's resources and Path to Exile and Tidehollow Sculler to disrupt their hand, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's development. Meanwhile, Eldrazi Displacer and Flickerwisp provide versatility and disruption on the battlefield. The goal is to control the board while chipping away at the opponent's life total, ultimately leading to victory through attrition and tempo advantage."
