Utilizing cards like Opt, Shock, and Finale of Promise to fuel the graveyard and bring back creatures, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of burn spells and powerful flying threats. By maintaining a balance between instant and sorcery spells, along with the inclusion of cards like Goblin Electromancer to reduce costs, this deck can consistently put pressure on the opponent and close out games quickly."
