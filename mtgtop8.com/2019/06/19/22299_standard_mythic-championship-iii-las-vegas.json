Goblin Electromancer helps reduce the cost of spells, while Finale of Promise allows for additional spell casting in a single turn. Chart a Course and Tormenting Voice help cycle through the deck to find key cards, while God-Eternal Kefnet provides additional value by potentially copying spells from the graveyard. The mana base is designed to support the UR color combination efficiently."

Finale of Glory can help go wide with tokens, and Prison Realm offers removal. The deck aims to flood the board with threats and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
