            "notes": "The deck is focused on utilizing Dredge mechanics to quickly fill up the graveyard with creatures like Bloodghast, Gravecrawler, Hogaak, and Vengevine. Cards like Altar of Dementia and Bridge from Below help to create a powerful engine where sacrificing creatures can lead to explosive plays. The inclusion of Carrion Feeder and Insolent Neonate provide additional sacrifice outlets to fuel the graveyard recursion. Faithless Looting helps with card selection and putting more cards into the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and consistent combo strategy utilizing graveyard synergies."
