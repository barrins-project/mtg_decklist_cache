By using cards like Aether Vial, Ancient Ziggurat, and Cavern of Souls to cheat creatures onto the battlefield, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on. Key cards like Champion of the Parish, Thalia's Lieutenant, and Mantis Rider provide valuable support and aggressive threats. With a focus on tempo and disruption, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan."

It also utilizes cards that provide card advantage and can disrupt the opponent's game plan, such as Snapcaster Mage and Surgical Extraction. The inclusion of versatile creatures like Tarmogoyf and Ice-Fang Coatl allows for flexibility in different matchups. The deck also has a land base that can support the Temur color combination effectively, allowing for consistent mana production throughout the game."
