By filling the graveyard with creatures like Bloodghast and Gravecrawler, the player can easily summon powerful creatures like Hogaak and Vengevine. The key strategy is to constantly fill and empty the graveyard to create a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent with creatures. The inclusion of cards like Altar of Dementia and Bridge from Below help to fuel this strategy and create a powerful combo deck focused on graveyard interactions."

It also includes efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember to control the board. The deck looks to quickly lower its own life total to pump up Death's Shadow while utilizing cards like Mishra's Bauble and Street Wraith to cycle through the deck. Additionally, Traverse the Ulvenwald helps the deck find key creatures like Tarmogoyf and utility lands."
