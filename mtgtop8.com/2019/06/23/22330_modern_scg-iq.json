By utilizing cards like Life from the Loam to dredge cards back into the hand, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of creatures and deal massive damage using cards like Creeping Chill and Conflagrate. The key strategy is to consistently mill cards and efficiently recur threats from the graveyard to win the game."
