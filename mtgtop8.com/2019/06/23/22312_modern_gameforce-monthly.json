By utilizing cards like Goblin Lore and Burning Inquiry, the player can quickly dump cards into the graveyard to potentially cast Hollow One for free or at a reduced cost. Bloodghast and Flamewake Phoenix can be recurring threats, while Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push provide removal options to clear a path for the aggressive creatures. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful board presence."
