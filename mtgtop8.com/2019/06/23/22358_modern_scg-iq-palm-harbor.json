By continuously disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Spellstutter Sprite and Inquisition of Kozilek, while also maintaining control with Cryptic Command, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's progress and eventually win through incremental advantage. The faerie creatures work well with each other, providing value and tempo advantage, while the mana base allows for flexibility and consistency in casting spells."

It aims to accelerate mana production through Eldrazi Temple and the Urza lands, while using cards like Matter Reshaper and Thought-Knot Seer to apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes removal spells like Dismember and All Is Dust to deal with threats, while Ugin, the Spirit Dragon provides a powerful finisher. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient threats backed up by disruption."
