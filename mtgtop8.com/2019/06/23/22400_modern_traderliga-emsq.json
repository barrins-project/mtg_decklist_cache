By utilizing cards like Collected Company and Aether Vial, the deck can quickly deploy multiple threats and maintain pressure on the opponent. The synergy between the spirit creatures, such as Drogskol Captain and Supreme Phantom, provides a boost to the team and makes them difficult to deal with. The combination of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells creates a fast-paced and versatile strategy that puts the opponent on the back foot."
