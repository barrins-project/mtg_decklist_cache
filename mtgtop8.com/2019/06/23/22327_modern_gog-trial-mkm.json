It includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to control the board, as well as powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil for additional disruption. The deck's strategy revolves around aggressive plays with creatures like Bedlam Reveler and Seasoned Pyromancer, while utilizing graveyard recursion and sacrifice effects from cards like Kolaghan's Command and Angrath's Rampage to maintain pressure on the opponent."
