By constantly adding counters to creatures like Hangarback Walker and Walking Ballista, the deck can quickly overwhelm opponents with a powerful army of creatures. The inclusion of cards like Arcbound Ravager and Arcbound Worker allows for additional synergy and the ability to sacrifice and move counters around to further bolster the board presence. The deck thrives on aggressive plays and establishing a threatening board presence early on."

It also features a toolbox of creatures that can be tutored for with cards like Eladamri's Call or Finale of Devastation, providing flexibility and versatility in different matchups. The deck aims to quickly find the pieces it needs to either win the game outright or establish a dominant board presence."

It uses cards like Primeval Titan to search for Valakut and lands that deal damage, as well as cards like Farseek and Search for Tomorrow to ramp up quickly. Other cards like Anger of the Gods and Lightning Bolt provide removal and disruption, while Relic of Progenitus helps to disrupt opponent graveyard strategies."
