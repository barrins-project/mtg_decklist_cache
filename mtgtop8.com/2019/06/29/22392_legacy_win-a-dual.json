The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Force of Will and Counterbalance, while also having card selection tools like Brainstorm and Ponder. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Narset, Parter of Veils provides additional value and card advantage. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game and out-valuing opponents."
