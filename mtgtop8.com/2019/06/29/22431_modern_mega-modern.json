The combo aspect comes from assembling either the Splinter Twin combo with Deceiver Exarch or Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker with Pestermite to generate infinite creature tokens for a win condition. The inclusion of Thing in the Ice provides a backup plan for a quick win condition. The deck also includes some versatile cards like Archmage's Charm and Cryptic Command for added flexibility in different game scenarios."
