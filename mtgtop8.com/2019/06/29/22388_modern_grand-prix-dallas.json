            "notes": "This Modern Combo - Dredge deck revolves around quickly filling up the graveyard and utilizing cards like Stitcher's Supplier, Faithless Looting, and Insolent Neonate to enable powerful synergies. The key strategy involves leveraging the dredge mechanic to continuously bring back creatures from the graveyard, such as Bloodghast, Gravecrawler, and Vengevine, to overwhelm the opponent. Additionally, Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis provides a powerful win condition, while Altar of Dementia allows for self-mill and potential combo finishes. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Bridge from Below and removal spells like Darkblast and Lightning Axe to control the battlefield."

By using cards like Temporal Mastery, Time Warp, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, the player can manipulate the game to their advantage by taking consecutive turns and keeping the opponent's resources limited. With cards like Gigadrowse and Cryptic Command, the deck can also counter opponent's spells and disrupt their game plan. The goal is to stall the opponent while setting up for a big combo turn to secure the win."
