By sacrificing creatures with Carrion Feeder and utilizing Bridge from Below, you can quickly generate a board presence and overwhelm your opponent with powerful creatures. The deck focuses on graveyard recursion and explosive plays to achieve victory in a fast and efficient manner."

The key strategy revolves around generating value through card draw and recursion, using cards like Mishra's Bauble and Goblin Engineer to find essential pieces like Urza, Lord High Artificer. The deck also has access to powerful tutor effects like Whir of Invention to search for specific answers or threats. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent in a slow and methodical manner."
