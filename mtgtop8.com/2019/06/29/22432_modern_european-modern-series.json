Cards like Through the Breach and Scapeshift allow for explosive plays, while Nahiri, the Harbinger provides additional utility. The removal spells and sideboard options help to keep the opponent's board under control while the combo pieces are put into place."

This will allow you to quickly fill your graveyard with cards like Stinkweed Imp and Narcomoeba, which can then be brought back to the battlefield with cards like Bloodghast and Prized Amalgam. Additionally, cards like Conflagrate and Creeping Chill can be used to deal damage to your opponent while also fueling your graveyard. The deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with a constant stream of creatures and disruption."
