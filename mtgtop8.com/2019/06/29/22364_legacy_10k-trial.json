In addition, disruption cards like Thoughtseize, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Hymn to Tourach help to control the opponent's hand while cards like Abrupt Decay and Assassin's Trophy deal with any threats on the board.

The deck utilizes powerful mana acceleration cards such as Lotus Petal and Lion's Eye Diamond, as well as efficient card selection and tutoring spells to find key combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Duress and Thoughtseize.
