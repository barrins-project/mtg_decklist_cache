By using cards that reduce the cost of casting spells or creatures, such as Springleaf Drum and Frogmite, the deck can flood the board with threats and finish off the opponent with burn spells like Galvanic Blast or cards like Fling and Temur Battle Rage. The deck aims to be fast and aggressive, leveraging the synergy between artifacts and creatures to create a powerful and efficient offense."
