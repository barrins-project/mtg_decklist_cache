The deck also utilizes removal spells like Swords to Plowshares to deal with opposing threats. The inclusion of equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Fire and Ice further enhances the deck's ability to close out games. Additionally, the mana base allows for consistent access to the necessary colors while also disrupting opponent's mana base with Wasteland."
