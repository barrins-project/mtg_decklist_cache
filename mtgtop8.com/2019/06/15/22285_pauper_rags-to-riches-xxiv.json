            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly playing out elves to build a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent with a high number of creatures. By utilizing mana dorks and card draw spells to ramp up and refill the hand consistently, the deck aims to maintain pressure and power while also ensuring enough resources for a steady stream of creatures. It emphasizes synergies between elves, such as boosting power with Timberwatch Elf or generating extra mana with Priest of Titania. Overall, the strategy revolves around efficiently playing creatures and utilizing their abilities to swiftly beat down opponents."
