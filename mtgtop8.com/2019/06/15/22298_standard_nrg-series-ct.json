            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game with removal spells, counterspells, and planeswalkers while also utilizing cards that allow for card advantage and resource manipulation. The main win condition is to grind the opponent out of resources through a combination of tempo plays and value generation. The deck's strategy revolves around disrupting the opponent's game plan and out-valuing them in the long game, ultimately leading to victory through attrition and control of the board state."
