The deck's strength lies in its ability to rapidly deploy a powerful board presence and maintain pressure on the opponent to secure a victory in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."

By using cards like Pestilence, Tragic Slip, and Palace Sentinels, the deck aims to keep the opponent's board clear while generating card advantage through cards like Phyrexian Rager and Thraben Inspector. With a mix of removal spells, card draw, and efficient creatures, the deck can grind out games and slowly take over the game through attrition and value. Additionally, the deck also utilizes the Orzhov Pestilence combo to further control the board and gain incremental advantage over time."
