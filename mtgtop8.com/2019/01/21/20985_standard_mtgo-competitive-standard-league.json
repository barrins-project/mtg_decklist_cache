The deck utilizes removal spells like Lava Coil, Bedeck / Bedazzle, and Bedevil to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, cards like Dire Fleet Daredevil and Duress provide additional disruption by allowing the player to utilize the opponent's spells against them or by stripping key cards from their hand. The deck also has access to burn spells like Banefire and Shock for additional reach. Treasure Map helps with card advantage and mana fixing, while The Eldest Reborn serves as versatile removal and disruption. The deck's mana base is built around Rakdos colors, providing a good balance of red and black sources to cast its spells consistently."
