The deck also includes win conditions like Secure the Wastes and Celestial Colonnade to close out the game once the opponent's threats have been dealt with. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color identity while also providing access to different types of mana required for its spells."

The inclusion of burn spells like Ramunap Ruins and creatures like Eldrazi Obligator and Endbringer provide reach and flexibility in dealing with threats. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain aggression throughout the game."
