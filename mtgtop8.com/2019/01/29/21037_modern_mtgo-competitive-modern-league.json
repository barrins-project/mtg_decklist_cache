Utilizing cards like Animation Module and Steel Overseer to generate additional value and power, the deck aims to close out games fast by building a formidable board presence. Throne of Geth provides additional synergy by sacrificing artifacts to proliferate counters, while Mox Opal accelerates mana production for explosive starts."
