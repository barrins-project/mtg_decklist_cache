The deck runs a number of mana dorks like Birds of Paradise and Noble Hierarch to accelerate its game plan, along with cards like Commune with Nature and Eldritch Evolution to tutor for key pieces. The deck is focused on efficiently assembling its combo and controlling the board until it can go off."
