The key strategy is to stall the opponent's threats while generating card advantage through Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Chemister's Insight. Niv-Mizzet, Parun and Crackling Drake provide additional win conditions while Sailor of Means can help ramp or block early aggression. The deck also includes some versatile spells like Settle the Wreckage and Deafening Clarion to deal with wide board states. Overall, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and secure the win through card advantage and powerful threats."
