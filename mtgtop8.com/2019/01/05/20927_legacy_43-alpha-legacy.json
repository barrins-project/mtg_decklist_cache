The deck includes various ways to search for the combo pieces, disrupt the opponent's hand through discard spells, and protect the combo with cards like Sylvan Safekeeper. It also utilizes cards like Life from the Loam to maximize graveyard synergy and provide card advantage. The deck aims to win the game through a powerful one-shot kill combo while controlling the opponent's resources."
