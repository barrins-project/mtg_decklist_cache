The deck includes various artifacts and mana sources like Terrarion, Mox Opal, and Mind Stone to fuel the combo. It also utilizes cards like Ichor Wellspring and Scrap Trawler to generate card advantage and recover artifacts from the graveyard.

The deck also includes cards like Tolaria West and Trinket Mage to search for important combo pieces such as Summoner's Pact and Engineered Explosives.

It utilizes land-bouncing effects like Simic Growth Chamber and bounce lands to generate excessive mana and gain extra land drops per turn. The deck also employs toolbox cards like Trinket Mage to search for key pieces like Engineered Explosives or Walking Ballista, while also including utility lands like Bojuka Bog for graveyard hate. The goal is to efficiently assemble the combo pieces and overwhelm opponents with massive threats."

The deck aims to draw through the deck quickly with Sleight of Hand and Serum Visions, finding key pieces like Gifts Ungiven and Grapeshot to ultimately win the game by casting a large storm count spell or creating a massive army of goblin tokens with Empty the Warrens. The deck relies on precise sequencing and careful planning to achieve victory."
