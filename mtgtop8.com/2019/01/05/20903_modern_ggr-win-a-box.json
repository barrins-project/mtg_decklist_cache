By doing so, the deck aims to generate value from cards like Narcomoeba, Bloodghast, and Prized Amalgam, which can be brought back from the graveyard to create a strong board presence. The deck also utilizes Conflagrate and Creeping Chill as finishers to close out games. Overall, the key strategy is to exploit the graveyard as a resource to achieve a powerful combo and overwhelm the opponent."
