By utilizing cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel, Goblin Guide, and Monastery Swiftspear, along with efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their game plan. The inclusion of Boros Charm and Lightning Helix provides additional reach and burn potential, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. The mana base is streamlined for consistency and speed in order to maximize the deck's aggressive strategy."
