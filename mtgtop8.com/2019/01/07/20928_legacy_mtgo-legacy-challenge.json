By utilizing powerful green creatures like Knight of the Reliquary and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, alongside equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Batterskull, the deck is able to apply pressure while controlling the game tempo. The inclusion of cards like Wasteland and Mother of Runes further solidify its aggro control strategy, allowing it to keep opponents on the back foot and secure victory through relentless aggression and disruption."
