Cards like History of Benalia and Heroic Reinforcements provide additional ways to boost the power of the creatures, while cards like Conclave Tribunal and Ajani, Adversary of Tyrants offer disruption and card advantage. The deck aims to close out games quickly before opponents can stabilize."

Cards like Nicol Bolas, the Ravager and Doom Whisperer provide powerful threats to close out the game once the opponent's resources are depleted. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Search for Azcanta and Chemister's Insight for card advantage and consistency. Overall, the key strategy is to outlast and outplay the opponent through careful resource management and decision-making."
