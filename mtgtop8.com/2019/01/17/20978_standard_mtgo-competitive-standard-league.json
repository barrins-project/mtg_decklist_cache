By playing low-cost creatures with powerful abilities like Adanto Vanguard and Skymarcher Aspirant, you can quickly build a strong board presence. Cards like Venerated Loxodon and History of Benalia help to pump up your creatures and further push for damage. Conclave Tribunal provides removal for any threats from the opponent. The deck aims to win quickly by curving out and maximizing the synergies between your creatures and spells."
