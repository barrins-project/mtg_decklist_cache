            "notes": "The focus of this deck is to quickly fill the graveyard with cards like Faithless Looting and Tormenting Voice, enabling the quick emergence of Arclight Phoenix onto the battlefield. This aggressive approach is supported by a suite of low-cost burn spells and efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear. The deck aims to capitalize on the powerful recursive abilities of Arclight Phoenix while maintaining relentless pressure on the opponent through direct damage spells."
