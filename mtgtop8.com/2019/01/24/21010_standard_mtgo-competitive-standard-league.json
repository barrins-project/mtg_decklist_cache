By combining powerful creatures like Rekindling Phoenix and Skarrgan Hellkite with cheap removal spells like Lightning Strike and Shock, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The Gruul Aggro archetype relies on a proactive strategy, utilizing creatures with haste and powerful abilities to close out games quickly. This deck aims to be efficient in dealing damage and putting the opponent on the back foot from the start."
