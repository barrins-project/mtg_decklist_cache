This is achieved through the use of cost reduction effects from Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer, as well as card draw and selection spells like Serum Visions, Sleight of Hand, and Opt. Gifts Ungiven is key in finding combo pieces, while rituals like Desperate Ritual and Pyretic Ritual help generate mana for explosive turns. The deck aims to win quickly and efficiently through its powerful combo potential."
