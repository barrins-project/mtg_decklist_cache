The deck also aims to tempo down the opponent by playing cheap removal such as Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods. The win condition is to cheat in Emrakul, the Aeons Torn with Through the Breach or by simply hard casting it. Snapcaster Mage provides versatility by flashing back key spells from the graveyard. The deck's mana base allows for consistency and flexibility in casting spells."
