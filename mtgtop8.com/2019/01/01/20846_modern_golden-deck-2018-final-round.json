The deck includes various artifacts and mana sources to facilitate the combo, as well as Engineered Explosives and Pyrite Spellbomb for removal and reach. The goal is to assemble the combo pieces and loop artifacts to generate enough value to overwhelm opponents and win the game in a single explosive turn. The key to success lies in efficiently managing resources and finding the right timing to go off."
