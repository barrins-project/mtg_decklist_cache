The deck also includes control elements like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus to slow down opposing strategies. The goal is to establish a dominant board presence and overwhelm the opponent with high-impact threats. The deck aims to control the game until it can deploy its powerful late-game threats and secure victory."

The deck also includes some card draw and filtering spells like Opt and Search for Azcanta to ensure it has the right answers at the right time."
