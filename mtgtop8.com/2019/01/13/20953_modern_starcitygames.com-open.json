Cards like Through the Breach and Summoner's Pact help to pull key pieces from the deck to set up game-winning plays. The deck focuses on cheating out powerful creatures early in the game to overwhelm opponents and secure victory through powerful attacks."

It utilizes a mix of instant speed removal and counterspells to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage through card draw and recursion with Snapcaster Mage. The game plan is to stabilize the board with sweepers like Supreme Verdict and finish the game with Teferi, Hero of Dominaria's powerful card advantage and board control. The mana base is designed to support the deck's triple color requirements and includes utility lands like Field of Ruin to deal with problematic lands."

The deck also includes utility lands and creatures to support the main combo and protect against opponent disruption. Additionally, it includes spells like Pact of Negation and Slaughter Pact to protect the combo and maintain control of the game. The key strategy is to assemble the land and creature pieces needed to execute the combo as quickly and efficiently as possible."
