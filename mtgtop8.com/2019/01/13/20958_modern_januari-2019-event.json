The deck then uses cards like Collected Company and Lead the Stampede to draw more elves and flood the board, before finishing off the opponent with a combination of Shaman of the Pack and Ezuri, Renegade Leader for a massive amount of damage. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of elves and combo off for a lethal finish."
