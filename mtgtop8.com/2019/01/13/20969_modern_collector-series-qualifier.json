The use of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack helps to disrupt and punish opposing strategies that rely on gaining life or casting large spells. This deck prioritizes speed and efficiency to secure victories in a short amount of time."

            "notes": "The main concept of this Aggro - Humans deck is to capitalize on the synergy between human creatures and various support cards to quickly build a strong board presence and apply pressure to the opponent. By using cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Champion of the Parish to pump up the team, along with disruptive creatures like Meddling Mage and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast, aggressive strategy. Aether Vial helps to cheat creatures into play, while cards like Reflector Mage and Tajic, Legion's Edge provide additional utility and protection for the team."
