The overall strategy is to control the game's pace and resources while steadily whittling down the opponent's life total."

The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan by restricting their mana base and preventing them from effectively casting spells, while maintaining a strong board presence with efficient threats. Additional cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Trinisphere help to further disrupt the opponent, allowing the deck to maintain control and come out on top in the aggro matchup."
