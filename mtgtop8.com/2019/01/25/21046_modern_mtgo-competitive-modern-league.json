It utilizes aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Guide, and Eidolon of the Great Revel, alongside powerful burn spells such as Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Rift Bolt. The deck aims to control the board and deny the opponent from gaining life through cards like Skullcrack and Shard Volley. It also includes card draw options like Light Up the Stage to maintain a steady flow of resources. The deck is designed to apply early pressure and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
