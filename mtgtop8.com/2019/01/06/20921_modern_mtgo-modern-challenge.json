The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Spellstutter Sprite, while efficiently removing threats with Bitterblossom, Fatal Push, and Hero's Downfall. Cryptic Command provides versatile options for controlling the game, while Liliana of the Veil and Jace, the Mind Sculptor offer additional card advantage and disruption. The deck's land base supports its strategy by providing color options, card filtering, and manlands for added threats."

By utilizing cards like Champion of the Parish, Thalia's Lieutenant, and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to grow and buff the creatures, along with Aether Vial for instant speed creature deployment and disruption, the deck aims to quickly establish board presence. Cards like Meddling Mage, Kitesail Freebooter, and Reflector Mage provide additional disruption and control elements, while Mantis Rider and Tajic, Legion's Edge offer evasive threats. The mana base is optimized for casting Humans efficiently."
