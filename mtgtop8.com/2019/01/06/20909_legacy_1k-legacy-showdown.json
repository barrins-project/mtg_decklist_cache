It also aims to apply pressure early with aggressive creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Legion Warboss. The inclusion of cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Fiery Confluence helps control the board and keep the opponent on the back foot. Overall, the key strategy is to establish a powerful board presence while hindering the opponent's ability to cast spells effectively."
