Teferi, Hero of Dominaria allows for card advantage and controlling the opponent's resources, while The Mirari Conjecture provides late-game value by recurring key spells. Deafening Clarion helps stabilize the board against aggressive decks, while Expansion / Explosion can be used for additional control or as a finisher. The mana base is designed to support the three-color requirement of Jeskai Control, ensuring that the player can cast their spells consistently throughout the game."
