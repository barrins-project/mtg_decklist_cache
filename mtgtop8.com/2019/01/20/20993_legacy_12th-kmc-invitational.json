By utilizing a combination of aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, along with a variety of efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Price of Progress and Sulfuric Vortex further punish the opponent for playing non-basic lands, while cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel discourage the opponent from casting spells. Overall, the deck is designed to overwhelm the opponent with fast, direct damage."
