            "notes": "The main concept of this Dimir Control deck is to disrupt the opponent's game plan by using a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and hand disruption. The deck aims to control the board with powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana of the Veil, while generating card advantage with Snapcaster Mage and Serum Visions. Bitterblossom and Spellstutter Sprite provide additional threats and disruption. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements while also having utility lands like Creeping Tar Pit and Field of Ruin for additional control options."
