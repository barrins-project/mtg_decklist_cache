By using cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Search for Azcanta, the deck aims to out-value the opponent while keeping the board clear with cards like Seal Away and Deafening Clarion. The deck also includes win conditions such as Karn, Scion of Urza and Ral, Izzet Viceroy to close out the game once the opponent has been sufficiently controlled. The goal is to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
