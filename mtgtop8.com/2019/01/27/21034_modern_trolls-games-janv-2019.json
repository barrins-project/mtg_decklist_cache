            "notes": "The deck focuses on casting cheap spells to quickly fill the graveyard with Arclight Phoenixes, while utilizing aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear to deal damage. Cards like Faithless Looting and Tormenting Voice help to filter through the deck, while Maximize Velocity and Gut Shot can provide additional damage and tempo advantage. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of burn spells, quick creatures, and the recurring threat of Arclight Phoenix to close out the game swiftly."
