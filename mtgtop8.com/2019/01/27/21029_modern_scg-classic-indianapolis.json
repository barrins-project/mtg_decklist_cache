By dredging and sacrificing creatures like Bloodghast, players can consistently bring back Prized Amalgam and Narcomoeba from the graveyard for lethal attacks. The deck also includes burn spells like Conflagrate and Creeping Chill to finish off opponents. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of graveyard recursion and aggressive creatures."

The deck also utilizes cards like Pyromancer Ascension and Faithless Looting to generate card advantage and further enhance the deck's aggressive game plan. Overall, the deck aims to quickly fill the graveyard, recur Arclight Phoenix, and apply pressure to the opponent with a combination of burn spells and powerful creatures."

The deck also includes tutoring effects like Ancient Stirrings and Whir of Invention to find key cards like Crucible of Worlds and Academy Ruins for value. The main win condition is to assemble an impenetrable defense while slowly grinding the opponent out with card advantage and efficient removal spells. The deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
