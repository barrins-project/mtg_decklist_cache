The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and finish them off before they can stabilize. By efficiently using cards like Needle Drop, Lightning Bolt, and Fireblast, along with creatures like Thermo-Alchemist and Ghitu Lavarunner, the deck can consistently chip away at the opponent's life total and win through direct damage. The inclusion of Curse of the Pierced Heart helps to maintain pressure on the opponent, forcing them to react quickly or risk losing the game."
