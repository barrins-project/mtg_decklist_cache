By utilizing token generators like Legion's Landing and March of the Multitudes, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures. Trostani Discordant and Venerated Loxodon provide additional support and buffs to the team, while Ajani, Adversary of Tyrants helps in proliferating counters and enabling more aggressive plays."

By utilizing powerful red removal spells like Lightning Strike and Lava Coil, as well as impactful creatures like Aurelia and Rekindling Phoenix, the deck aims to control the board while constantly pressuring the opponent's life total. Experimental Frenzy provides card advantage and allows for explosive turns, while the efficient mana base ensures consistent plays. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and relentless attacks, ending the game before they can stabilize."
