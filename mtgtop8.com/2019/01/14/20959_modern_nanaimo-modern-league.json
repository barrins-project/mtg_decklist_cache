By disrupting the opponent's resources with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, as well as using removal spells like Fatal Push and Smallpox, the deck aims to gradually wear down the opponent and secure victory through attrition. Liliana of the Veil serves as a versatile planeswalker that can further disrupt the opponent's hand and board, while also providing additional win conditions."

Overall, the deck aims to win the game as quickly as possible through a combination of direct damage and creature aggression."
