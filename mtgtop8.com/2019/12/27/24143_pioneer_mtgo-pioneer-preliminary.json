The deck utilizes powerful red creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Glorybringer, along with burn spells such as Wild Slash and Lightning Strike to control the board and deal direct damage to the opponent. Combined with the strong synergy provided by cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Embercleave, the deck aims to close out games swiftly and decisively."
