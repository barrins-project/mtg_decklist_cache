The deck focuses on setting up strong turns with cantrips like Preordain and Brainstorm, while also having a flexible game plan with cards like Deprive and Tragic Lesson. The mana base includes snow-covered lands for Skred synergy and consistent fixing."

The key concept is to establish board dominance and control with cards like Mulldrifter, Dinrova Horror, Mnemonic Wall, and Stonehorn Dignitary. The deck also includes cards like Ghostly Flicker and Ephemerate to generate value and card advantage through flickering creatures and triggering their enter the battlefield effects multiple times. The goal is to stall the opponent's strategy and eventually win through card advantage and overwhelming mana advantage."
