Cards like Scale Up and Might of Old Krosa offer ways to pump up the infect creatures, while protection spells like Blossoming Defense and Vines of Vastwood help keep them safe. The deck aims to assemble a quick and powerful infect combo to overwhelm the opponent before they can mount a defense. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the aggressive game plan and ensure smooth gameplay."
