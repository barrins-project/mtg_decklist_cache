The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce, while also manipulating the top of their library with cards like Counterbalance and Predict. By utilizing a mix of removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and board wipes like Supreme Verdict and Terminus, the deck aims to keep the opponent's board clear while slowly building up resources to eventually win the game with powerful finishers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor or Entreat the Angels."
