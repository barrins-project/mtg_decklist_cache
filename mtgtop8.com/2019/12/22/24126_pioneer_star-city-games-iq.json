The deck also includes some removal options like Mizzium Mortars and Bonecrusher Giant to deal with opponent's threats. The Planeswalkers Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner, Domri, Anarch of Bolas, and Domri Rade provide additional value and support to the aggressive strategy of the deck. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, powerful creatures and efficient removal spells."
