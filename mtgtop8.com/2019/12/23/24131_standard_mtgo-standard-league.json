The deck focuses on using Teferi, Time Raveler to disrupt the opponent's strategy and protect your own key spells. Gadwick, the Wizened is used for card draw and tempo advantage, while Brazen Borrower provides a versatile threat that can also be flashed in to bounce permanents. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent through card advantage and careful resource management."
