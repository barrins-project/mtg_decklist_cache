By utilizing cards like Grisly Salvage, Gather the Pack, and Stitcher's Supplier, the player can fill their graveyard with creatures like Prized Amalgam and Narcomoeba. These creatures can then be used to quickly overwhelm the opponent with early aggression, while also utilizing cards like Haunted Dead and Scrapheap Scrounger as recurring threats. Overall, the deck aims to consistently put pressure on the opponent through efficient creature recursion and graveyard shenanigans."
