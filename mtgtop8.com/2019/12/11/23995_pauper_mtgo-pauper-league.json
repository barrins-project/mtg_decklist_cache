By grinding out incremental advantages and maintaining board control, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and eventually win the game through attrition. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to both black and white mana sources for casting the various spells in the deck."

The goal is to create a strong, evasive creature that can deal a lot of damage quickly, utilizing cards like Ancestral Mask and Aura Gnarlid to really boost their power. With the inclusion of Slippery Bogle and Silhana Ledgewalker for protection and evasion, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive, aura-enchanted creatures."
