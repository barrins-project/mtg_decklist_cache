The inclusion of Stoneforge Mystic and equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine provide additional win conditions. The mana base is optimized for consistency and can adapt to different situations with the help of Arcum's Astrolabe. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and win through incremental advantage."

It aims to generate value through cards like Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Urza, Lord High Artificer, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Drown in the Loch and Thoughtseize. The mana base includes a variety of fetch lands and snow-covered lands to enable the deck's color requirements. Overall, the deck seeks to outvalue and outmaneuver its opponent through efficient control elements."
