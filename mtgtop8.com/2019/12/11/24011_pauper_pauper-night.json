Cards like Timberwatch Elf and Lys Alana Huntmaster provide additional power and win conditions, while Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to refill the hand with more Elves. The deck aims to quickly build a board presence and pump up its creatures to push through damage and overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
