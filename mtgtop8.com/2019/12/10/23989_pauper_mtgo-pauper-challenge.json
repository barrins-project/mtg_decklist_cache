            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly deal damage to the opponent through direct burn spells and efficient creatures. By utilizing low-cost cards and a high number of damage-dealing spells, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize their board. This aggressive strategy allows for fast-paced games and puts pressure on the opponent to react quickly or risk losing the game. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Thermo-Alchemist and Ghitu Lavarunner provides additional damage output and potential for repeated damage each turn."
