The deck focuses on ramping with cards like Farseek and Sakura-Tribe Elder to quickly get to the required lands to activate Valakut's ability. Additional ramp and land destruction spells are included to help accelerate the combo and ensure its success. Lightning Bolt provides additional removal or reach to close out the game."
