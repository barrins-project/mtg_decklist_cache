The mana base is designed to support both color requirements and a strong land destruction plan with cards like Field of Ruin. Overall, the deck aims to control the board, disrupt the opponent's strategy, and outvalue them with powerful card advantage engines."

It aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and reach lethal damage before the opponent can stabilize. The deck also includes cards that provide additional utility and flexibility, such as removal spells and pump spells to boost the power of its creatures. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive game plan, allowing it to consistently cast its spells and maximize its efficiency."
