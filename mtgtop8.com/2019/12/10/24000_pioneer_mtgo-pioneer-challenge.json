The deck aims to efficiently use its mana base to cast powerful creatures such as Siege Rhino and Emrakul, the Promised End, while also generating card advantage with cards like Grim Flayer and Tireless Tracker. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Liliana, the Last Hope and Vraska, Golgari Queen provides additional utility and threats to further pressure the opponent. Overall, the deck combines aggression, disruption, and card advantage to overwhelm the opponent."
