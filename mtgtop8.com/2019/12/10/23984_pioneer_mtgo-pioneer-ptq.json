The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while drawing cards, generating value, and ultimately outlasting them in a long game. The deck also utilizes lands like Castle Ardenvale and Castle Vantress for additional utility and late-game advantage. This deck excels at outplaying opponents and grinding out wins through careful resource management and strategic play."
