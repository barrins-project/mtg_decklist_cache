By leveraging cards like Gather the Pack, Grisly Salvage, and Traverse the Ulvenwald to fill the graveyard, the deck can quickly bring out powerful threats like Soulflayer and Questing Beast. Additionally, the inclusion of Zetalpa, Primal Dawn provides a high-impact finisher, while cards like Murderous Rider and Gifted Aetherborn offer versatility and disruption. The mana base is optimized for consistent colors and early plays, allowing for a smooth curve and aggressive gameplay."
