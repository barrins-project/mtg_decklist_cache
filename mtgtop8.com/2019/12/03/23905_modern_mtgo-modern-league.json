It also uses Lingering Souls and Bloodghast to quickly rebuild its own board presence. The inclusion of Haakon, Stromgald Scourge allows for additional value by enabling Nameless Inversion as a removal spell. The deck also has a mana base that supports its color requirements and includes key lands like Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth and Ghost Quarter for additional utility."
