This aggro strategy is supported by powerful creatures like Gisela, the Broken Blade and Resplendent Angel, as well as anthem effects like Always Watching. The deck also includes lifelink creatures and lifegain effects to help stabilize against faster or more aggressive opponents. By constantly applying pressure and maintaining a strong board presence, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
