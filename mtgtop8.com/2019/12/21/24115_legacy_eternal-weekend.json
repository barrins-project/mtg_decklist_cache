It makes use of cheap threats like Delver of Secrets, Young Pyromancer, and Dreadhorde Arcanist to apply pressure while disrupting the opponent's gameplan with countermagic like Force of Will and Daze, and removal like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push. The deck is also able to filter through its deck with card selection spells like Brainstorm and Ponder to find the right cards at the right time."

The deck aims to control the board with counterspells and removal while maintaining a fast-paced tempo to close out the game quickly. Additionally, True-Name Nemesis and Brazen Borrower provide additional threats and disruptive elements to keep the opponent on the back foot. The deck focuses on quick, aggressive plays to overpower the opponent and secure victory."
