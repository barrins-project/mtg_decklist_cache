With cards like Aspect of Hydra and Avatar of the Resolute to pump up creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a large board presence and efficient mana ramp. Vivien, Arkbow Ranger provides additional support and removal options for the deck."

The key strategy is to maintain tempo, keep the pressure on, and close out the game as quickly as possible."

The deck aims to control the game tempo and outvalue opponents with powerful threats like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Supreme Verdict to stabilize the board. The addition of utility lands like Castle Vantress and Field of Ruin provide additional options for manipulating the game state. Overall, the key strategy revolves around controlling the board and hand, while slowly building up card advantage to secure a win."
