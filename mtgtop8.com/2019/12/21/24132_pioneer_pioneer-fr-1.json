Cards like Supreme Phantom and Empyrean Eagle boost the power of Spirit creatures, while Reflector Mage and Spell Queller provide disruptive elements to control the opponent's board. Collected Company allows for explosive plays, while Teferi, Time Raveler offers additional tempo advantage and protection. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast, evasive creature strategy."
