By sacrificing creatures with Altar of Dementia and generating Zombie tokens with Bridge from Below, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of speed and graveyard recursion. Additionally, hand disruption with Cabal Therapy helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect the combo pieces."
