The deck aims to quickly build a wide board of creatures, using cards like Pelt Collector and Lovestruck Beast, and then pump them up with cards like Venerated Loxodon and Huatli's Raptor to overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes removal and disruption cards like Conclave Tribunal and Giant Killer to deal with opposing threats. The mana base is set up to ensure consistency in casting the deck's spells."
