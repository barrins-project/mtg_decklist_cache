It also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Teferi, Time Raveler, and Oko, Thief of Crowns to control the board and generate card advantage. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by trading resources efficiently and eventually winning the game with powerful threats like Baleful Strix and Snapcaster Mage. The mana base is tuned to support the deck's three-color requirements while also fixing the colors effectively."
