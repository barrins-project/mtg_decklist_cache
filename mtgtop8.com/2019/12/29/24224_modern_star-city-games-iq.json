By using efficient creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear along with powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Lava Spike, the deck aims to deal damage fast and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze also helps to punish opponents for playing spells or creatures. The key strategy is to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain that pressure until victory."

By using powerful draw spells like Opt and Hieroglyphic Illumination, the deck can filter through its library to find answers to any situation. Mystic Sanctuary allows the deck to recur important spells from the graveyard, providing additional value. The deck's game plan is to disrupt the opponent's strategy, maintain board control, and win through incremental advantage."
