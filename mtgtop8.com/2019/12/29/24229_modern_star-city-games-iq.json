The deck also utilizes artifacts like Mox Opal and Mishra's Bauble for additional mana and card advantage. The inclusion of snow-covered lands allows for synergies with cards like Ice-Fang Coatl. Overall, the strategy revolves around maintaining control of the board and out-valuing the opponent to secure victory."
