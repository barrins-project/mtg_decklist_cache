With the addition of powerful finishers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Embercleave, the deck aims to close out games swiftly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of Torbran, Thane of Red Fell enhances the damage output of the deck's spells, making it even more potent in a fast-paced, aggressive strategy."
