            "notes": "This deck focuses on maintaining control over the game by using a combination of removal spells, planeswalkers, and disruptive enchantments. It aims to control the board with cards like Fatal Push, Doom Foretold, and Karn, Scion of Urza while also generating value through cards like History of Benalia and Liliana, Dreadhorde General. The deck can also gain life and stabilize with cards like Knight of the Ebon Legion and Gifted Aetherborn. Overall, the strategy revolves around slowly grinding down the opponent's resources and securing victory through attrition."
