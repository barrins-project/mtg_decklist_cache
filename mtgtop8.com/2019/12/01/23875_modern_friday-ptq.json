This enables powerful synergies with cards like Vengevine and Carrion Feeder to create a powerful board presence early in the game. Glimpse the Unthinkable and Hedron Crab provide additional graveyard filling and milling effects to fuel the combo. Oko, Thief of Crowns serves as a versatile disruption tool and win condition. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and resilient combo."

The deck also includes various control elements like Karn Liberated and Oblivion Stone to deal with opposing threats while using cards like Sylvan Scrying and Ancient Stirrings to find key pieces of the Tron lands.
