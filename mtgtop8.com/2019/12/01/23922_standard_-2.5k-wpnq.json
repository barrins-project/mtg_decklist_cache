Claim the Firstborn allows the deck to steal and sacrifice opposing creatures, while Angrath's Rampage and Rankle, Master of Pranks disrupt opponents' strategies. Chandra, Acolyte of Flame provides extra value and the deck prioritizes a balanced mana base to support its aggressive and sacrifice strategies."
