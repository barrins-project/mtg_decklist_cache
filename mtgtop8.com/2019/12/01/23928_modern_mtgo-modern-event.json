The deck also benefits from card advantage and mana ramp with cards like Light Up the Stage and Manamorphose. Overall, the goal is to maintain a fast pace and deal lethal damage before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly filling the graveyard with cards like Hedron Crab and Stitcher's Supplier, allowing for strong graveyard interactions with cards like Gravecrawler and Prized Amalgam. The key strategy is to quickly mill through the deck to return creatures like Vengevine to the battlefield and deal damage with Creeping Chill. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and aggressive graveyard-based combo. Memory Sluice and Glimpse the Unthinkable help with milling while also providing card advantage. The deck includes a mix of fetch lands and shock lands to ensure consistency in mana sources."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly and efficiently land infect creatures like Blighted Agent and Glistener Elf on the battlefield, then use various pump spells like Scale Up, Groundswell, and Might of Old Krosa to give these creatures infect damage. The deck also includes protection spells like Blossoming Defense and Spell Pierce to ensure the infect creatures can attack successfully. The mana base is focused on ensuring access to the necessary colors while including utility lands like Pendelhaven and Inkmoth Nexus for additional benefits. By combining aggressive creatures with powerful pump spells, this deck aims to quickly close out the game by dealing 10 infect damage to the opponent."
