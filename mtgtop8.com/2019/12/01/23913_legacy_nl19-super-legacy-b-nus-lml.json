Additionally, cards like Force of Will and Unsettled Mariner provide protection against removal and disruption, allowing the deck to maintain its aggressive strategy. The synergy between different types of Slivers enhances their effectiveness and makes them difficult to deal with."

The deck relies on card advantage, efficient removal, and powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to outvalue the opponent and take over the game. The inclusion of cards like Snapcaster Mage and Monastery Mentor provide additional versatility and win conditions to close out the game."
