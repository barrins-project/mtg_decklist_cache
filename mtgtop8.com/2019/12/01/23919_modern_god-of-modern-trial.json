Support those creatures with burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Lava Spike to finish your opponent off quickly. Use cards like Searing Blaze and Skullcrack to control the board and prevent your opponent from stabilizing. With a mana base that supports its aggressive strategy, this deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent can set up their own game plan."

It uses ramp spells like Sakura-Tribe Elder and Farseek to accelerate mana production and cheat Primeval Titan or other impactful creatures into play with Through the Breach. The inclusion of Nightpack Ambusher and Bonecrusher Giant provides some flexibility and disruption to the game plan. The deck is focused on quickly setting up its win condition and overwhelming the opponent with powerful creatures and burn spells."
