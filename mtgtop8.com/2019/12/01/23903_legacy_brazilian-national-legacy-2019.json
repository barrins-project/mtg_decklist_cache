With a solid suite of counter spells like Force of Will and Dovin's Veto, coupled with efficient removal like Swords to Plowshares, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Card selection and manipulation through Brainstorm and Ponder allow for consistency in drawing key cards. Planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Oko, Thief of Crowns provide additional value and control options. The deck also has win conditions in the form of Entreat the Angels and Monastery Mentor for late-game stabilization."

The deck aims to control the tempo of the game through a combination of card advantage from Brainstorm and Ponder, along with land disruption from cards like Wasteland. By applying pressure while disrupting the opponent, the deck seeks to quickly close out games before the opponent can establish a strong board presence."

The inclusion of cards like Back to Basics and Terminus help to further control the board state and limit the opponent's options. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent access to the necessary resources."
