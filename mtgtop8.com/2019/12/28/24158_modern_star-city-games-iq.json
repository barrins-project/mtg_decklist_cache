The deck also includes cards like Cathartic Reunion and Shriekhorn to dig through the library and discard cards for additional value. Finally, the deck utilizes cards like Creeping Chill and Conflagrate to deal damage and close out the game."

It also includes control elements like Ghost Quarter and Field of Ruin to disrupt the opponent's mana base. The main win condition of the deck is Field of the Dead, creating a zombie army to overwhelm the opponent. Additionally, cards like Sakura-Tribe Elder and Courser of Kruphix help with deck thinning and card advantage. The deck aims to control the game and win with its powerful late-game threats."
