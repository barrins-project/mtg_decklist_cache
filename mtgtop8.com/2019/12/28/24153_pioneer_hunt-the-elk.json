The deck aims to control the board with sweepers like Supreme Verdict and removal spells like Azorius Charm, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with counter spells like Absorb and Syncopate. Card advantage is gained through cards like Search for Azcanta, Sphinx's Revelation, and Dig Through Time, allowing the player to outvalue their opponent. The planeswalkers, Teferi and Narset, further help in card advantage and disrupting the opponent's strategy. The deck ultimately aims to grind out the opponent and win through incremental advantage."

By using creatures like Stonecoil Serpent and Walking Ballista, along with mana ramp from Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves, the deck can quickly overwhelm opponents with a strong board presence. Cards like Vivien, Arkbow Ranger and Voracious Hydra provide additional ways to buff creatures or deal direct damage, while Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Forests ensure a steady flow of mana for consistent aggression."
