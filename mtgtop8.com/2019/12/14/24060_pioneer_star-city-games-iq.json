This allows for explosive plays with powerful threats like Hydroid Krasis and Wicked Wolf, while also disrupting the opponent with Oko's versatile abilities. The inclusion of Walking Ballista and Scavenging Ooze provides additional removal and graveyard hate, making it a well-rounded and aggressive Simic Aggro deck aiming to overwhelm the opponent with strong creatures and versatile planeswalkers."

The deck aims to maintain board control through cards like Anger of the Gods, Magma Spray, and Abrade, while also generating card advantage and ramping with Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Sarkhan, Fireblood. The dragons in the deck, including Thunderbreak Regent and Glorybringer, provide a strong win condition and can quickly close out the game. Additionally, the deck includes some utility lands like Field of Ruin and Haven of the Spirit Dragon to further manipulate the battlefield."
