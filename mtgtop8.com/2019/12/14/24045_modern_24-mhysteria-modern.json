The deck also utilizes cards like Mishra's Bauble and Once Upon a Time to manipulate draws and find key pieces, allowing it to quickly close out games through a combination of efficient threats and disruption."

By assembling Urza's lands, the deck can quickly generate a lot of mana to cast big threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Wurmcoil Engine. Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon provide additional control options, while cards like Oblivion Stone and Blast Zone help deal with opposing threats. The deck aims to overpower the opponent with its large threats and efficient removal spells."
