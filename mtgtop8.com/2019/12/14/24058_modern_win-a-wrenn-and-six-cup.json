            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly deal damage to the opponent through efficient burn spells and aggressive creatures. By using cards like Goblin Guide, Monastery Swiftspear, and Eidolon of the Great Revel, the deck aims to apply constant pressure while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Lightning Helix and Boros Charm. The goal is to win the game as quickly as possible by reducing the opponent's life total to zero before they can stabilize or mount a meaningful defense."
