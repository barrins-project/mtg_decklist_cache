By utilizing ramp cards like Llanowar Elves and Gilded Goose to quickly get ahead on mana, this deck can play its threats ahead of schedule and apply pressure early in the game. Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Oko, Thief of Crowns provide strong utility and disruption, while cards like Voracious Hydra and Hydroid Krasis offer flexibility and scaling threats. By combining efficient creatures with powerful support cards, this deck aims to dominate the board and close out games quickly."
