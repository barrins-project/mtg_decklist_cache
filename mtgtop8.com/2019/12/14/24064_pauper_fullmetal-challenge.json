The deck utilizes low-cost creatures like Glint Hawk, Thraben Inspector, and Kor Skyfisher to generate card advantage and maintain a strong board presence. It also includes burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast to clear the way or finish off the opponent. The deck further strengthens its aggressive strategy with cards like Battle Screech and Palace Sentinels, providing additional creatures and card draw. Its mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and maintain consistency."
