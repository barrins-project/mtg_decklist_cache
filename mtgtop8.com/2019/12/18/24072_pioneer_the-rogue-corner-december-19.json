With a mix of removal spells like Anger of the Gods and Magma Spray, along with powerful dragons like Glorybringer and Stormbreath Dragon, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and finish them off with powerful dragon attacks. Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Sarkhan, Fireblood help ramp into big threats while providing card advantage. Ultimately, the key strategy is to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with powerful dragons."
