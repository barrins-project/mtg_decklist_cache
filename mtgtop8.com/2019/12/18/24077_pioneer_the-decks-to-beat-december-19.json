With mana ramp provided by Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves, the deck can play its threats ahead of schedule and maintain pressure on the opponent, supported by removal spells like Fatal Push and powerful planeswalkers like Nissa and Vivien."

By using efficient creatures like Bloodsoaked Champion, Gutterbones, Knight of the Ebon Legion, and Scrapheap Scrounger, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total. Additionally, removal spells like Fatal Push, Grasp of Darkness, and Thoughtseize help to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also includes versatile threats like Murderous Rider and Rankle, Master of Pranks to provide additional ways to close out the game."
