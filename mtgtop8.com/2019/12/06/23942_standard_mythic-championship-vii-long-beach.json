By restricting the number of spells you can cast per turn to 2 (due to Fires of Invention's effect), you can control the board with powerful spells like Deafening Clarion and use high-impact creatures like Cavalier of Flame to quickly close out the game. Teferi, Time Raveler provides additional control and disruption, while the deck's consistency is improved through land filtering with cards like Shimmer of Possibility and Castle Vantress."
