The deck aims to control the board and win through incremental advantage, using powerful cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria to outvalue the opponent. The deck also has ways to recur important spells with Mystic Sanctuary and protect its game plan with Force of Negation. Ultimately, the goal is to outlast the opponent and secure victory through superior card advantage and control."

Cards like Hedron Crab and Stitcher's Supplier help achieve this goal, while creatures like Gravecrawler and Narcomoeba can be brought back easily from the graveyard. By setting up your graveyard with key pieces like Vengevine and Prized Amalgam, you can overwhelm your opponent with a fast and relentless assault. The deck also includes cards like Creeping Chill to drain your opponent's life and Glimpse the Unthinkable to further mill your deck."
