Once you have enough lands on the battlefield, you can use Scapeshift to sacrifice them and search for even more mountains, dealing massive amounts of damage to your opponent with Valakut triggers. The deck also includes cards like Veil of Summer to protect your combo and cards like Hour of Promise to search for more lands to ensure your combo is successful."

The key concept revolves around using mana acceleration from cards like Gilded Goose and Mox Opal to play powerful threats like Urza and Oko, while also disrupting opponents with counterspells and removal. The deck also utilizes cards like Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Engineered Explosives to maintain board control. Overall, the strategy combines efficient removal, card advantage, and powerful threats to outvalue opponents and control the game."
