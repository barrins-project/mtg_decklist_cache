The mana base is carefully constructed to support the multicolor requirements of the deck, with mana dorks like Noble Hierarch and Gilded Goose helping to ramp into the more expensive spells. Overall, the deck seeks to control the game early on before transitioning into a proactive midrange strategy to close out the game."
