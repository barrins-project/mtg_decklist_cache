The deck focuses on playing efficient and evasive creatures such as Spectral Sailor and Spell Queller, while also providing disruption with cards like Spell Pierce and Brazen Borrower. By increasing the power of Spirits with cards like Supreme Phantom and Empyrean Eagle, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total before they are able to stabilize. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize consistency."
