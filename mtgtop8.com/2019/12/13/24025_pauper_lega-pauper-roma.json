By utilizing aggressive cards like Rancor, Elephant Guide, and Savage Swipe, along with creatures like Vault Skirge, Skarrgan Pit-Skulk, and Nettle Sentinel, the goal is to establish a strong board presence early in the game. The inclusion of cards like Quirion Ranger and Burning-Tree Emissary provide additional synergy and mana acceleration to maintain the pressure on the opponent. Overall, the strategy revolves around quick and consistent aggression to push for a speedy victory."
