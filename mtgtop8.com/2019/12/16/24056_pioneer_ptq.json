            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively ramp up green mana through devotion, utilizing cards like Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Nissa, Who Shakes the World. By flooding the board with mana, the deck can quickly bring out powerful threats like Voracious Hydra and Walking Ballista to overwhelm the opponent. Vivien, Arkbow Ranger and Questing Beast provide additional utility and evasion, while cards like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic help accelerate the deck's explosive early game. With a focus on green devotion and aggressive plays, this deck aims to overpower the opponent quickly."
