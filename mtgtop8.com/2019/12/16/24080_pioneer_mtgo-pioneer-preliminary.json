Cards like Gilded Goose and Elvish Mystic provide additional ramp, while Oko, Thief of Crowns disrupts the opponent's board and creates threats of your own. Wicked Wolf and Walking Ballista offer removal options and Lovestruck Beast provides a big body for attacking. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early, while also having the capability to go long with powerful mid to late game threats."
