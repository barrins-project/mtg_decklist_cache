It also aims to gain card advantage and outvalue the opponent with cards like Seasons Past and Nissa, Vastwood Seer. The control elements present in the deck, such as board wipes and removal, help maintain control of the game and allow for a more controlling playstyle. The deck also includes a small ramp package with Nissa's Pilgrimage and Nissa's Renewal to help cast powerful spells like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon."
