Players use cards like Dark Ritual, Cabal Ritual, and Lion's Eye Diamond to generate mana, while cards like Duress, Thoughtseize, and Brainstorm help filter through the deck and protect the combo. By casting spells like Ad Nauseam and Tendrils of Agony, the deck can create a storm count high enough to deal lethal damage to the opponent in a single turn."

The deck utilizes powerful mana acceleration cards like Ancient Tomb and Simian Spirit Guide to ramp into powerful Planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Karn, Scion of Urza. By utilizing cards like Blood Moon and Chalice of the Void, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and lock them out of the game while applying pressure with its aggressive creatures."
