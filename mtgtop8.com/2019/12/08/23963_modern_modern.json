It utilizes cards like Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying to search for key pieces like the Urza lands and Expedition Map for consistency. The deck also includes removal options like Oblivion Stone and Walking Ballista for control. The goal is to establish a strong board presence while controlling the opponent's board through powerful spells and creatures."
