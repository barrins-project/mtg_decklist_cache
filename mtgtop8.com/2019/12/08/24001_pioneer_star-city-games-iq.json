The deck focuses on quickly ramping up mana using mana dorks like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic, and then casting impactful threats like Steel Leaf Champion, Questing Beast, and Lovestruck Beast. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Vivien, Arkbow Ranger provide additional value and flexibility. The deck also includes key spells like Stubborn Denial to counter opposing spells and maintain tempo advantage."
