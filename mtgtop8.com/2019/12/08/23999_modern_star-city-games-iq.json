It includes cards like Scapeshift and Through the Breach to quickly put the combo together, along with ramp spells like Search for Tomorrow and Explore to accelerate the process. Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Primeval Titan are key threats that can also help close out the game. Chalice of the Void provides disruption for the opponent's game plan, while Simian Spirit Guide and Sakura-Tribe Elder help ramp and fix the mana base."
