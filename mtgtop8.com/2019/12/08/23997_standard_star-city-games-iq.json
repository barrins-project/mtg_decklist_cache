Gadwick, the Wizened can draw cards and tap down opposing creatures, providing card advantage and disruption. The deck also includes burn spells like Scorching Dragonfire and Ral's Outburst for additional removal options. The mana base includes lands that can scry or fix mana to ensure consistency in casting spells. The goal is to outvalue the opponent and ultimately finish the game with strong creatures and burn spells."
