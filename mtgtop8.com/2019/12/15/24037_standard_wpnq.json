The combination of card draw, efficient creatures, and disruption spells creates a fast and aggressive strategy that aims to quickly establish board control and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Quench, Sinister Sabotage, and Brazen Borrower helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain tempo throughout the match."
