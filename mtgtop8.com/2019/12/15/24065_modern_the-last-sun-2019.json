With this mana, the deck aims to play powerful threats like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, Karn Liberated, and Wurmcoil Engine to control the board and dominate the late game. The deck also features removal spells like Dismember and Oblivion Stone to deal with threats, along with card selection and ramp cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to find key pieces quickly. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game and overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats."
