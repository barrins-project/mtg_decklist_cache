By utilizing mana acceleration and efficient creatures like Hydroid Krasis, Jadelight Ranger, and Wicked Wolf, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive game plan. The addition of Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Heart of Kiran provide additional mana sources and evasive threats to further push the tempo and pressure on the opponent."
