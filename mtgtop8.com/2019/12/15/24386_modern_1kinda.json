The deck includes a variety of lands and mana acceleration cards to ensure consistent access to all five colors of mana. Teferi, Time Raveler and Wrenn and Six provide control elements such as disruption and card advantage. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Helix, Kolaghan's Command, and Dreadbore for dealing with threats. Bring to Light allows the deck to search for specific answers or threats. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and outvalue opponents with the powerful Niv-Mizzet Reborn."
