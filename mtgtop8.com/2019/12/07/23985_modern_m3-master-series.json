It also has a solid mana base to support its color requirements. The deck aims to curve out with powerful cards like Tarmogoyf, Bloodbraid Elf, and Oko, Thief of Crowns, while using powerful removal and disruptive spells like Lightning Bolt and Thoughtseize to keep opponents on the back foot. The strategy is to apply constant pressure on the opponent and out value them with strong card advantage engines like Liliana of the Veil and Wrenn and Six."
