Karn, the Great Creator is used to shut down opponents' artifacts, while Field of the Dead can provide additional value in the late game. The mix of lands, including utility lands like Boros Garrison and Bojuka Bog, allows for flexibility in different situations. With efficient card selection and mana acceleration, this deck aims to consistently assemble its combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful creatures."

            "notes": "The primary focus of this deck is to assemble the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Tower, Power Plant, and Mine) in order to generate a large amount of mana quickly. With this mana advantage, the deck aims to control the game by playing powerful threats such as Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, Karn Liberated, and various Eldrazi creatures. The deck also includes removal spells and card filtering to handle opponents' threats and maintain card advantage. The overall strategy is to ramp up quickly, control the board, and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
