By playing creatures like Avatar of the Resolute, Steel Leaf Champion, and Rhonas the Indomitable, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with big threats early in the game. The inclusion of cards like Blossoming Defense and Aspect of Hydra helps protect and pump up creatures to maintain pressure on the opponent. The deck's mana base supports its strategy by providing the necessary green mana sources to cast its powerful creatures and spells."
