The deck also includes disruptive spells like Stubborn Denial to protect its threats, as well as versatile planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns for additional value. The deck aims to apply pressure early with efficient creatures and generate advantage with its planeswalkers, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with a combination of aggro and tempo strategies."
