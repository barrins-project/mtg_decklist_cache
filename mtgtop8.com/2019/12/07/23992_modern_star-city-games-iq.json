The deck also utilizes mana acceleration with Noble Hierarch and Aether Vial, along with a mana base tailored to support the Human tribal theme."

Primeval Titan can also be used to search for additional lands or Valakut, while cards like Reclamation Sage provide utility. The deck aims to control the board until it can assemble the combo pieces needed to win the game in a single turn."
