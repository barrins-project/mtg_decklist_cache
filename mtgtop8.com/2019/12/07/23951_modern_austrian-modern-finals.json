Additionally, the deck includes removal spells like Dismember and All Is Dust to deal with threats, while also having access to versatile artifacts like Walking Ballista and Hangarback Walker to provide additional threats or utility as needed."

By utilizing cards like Aether Vial and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to disrupt the opponent's game plan, combined with powerful creatures like Mantis Rider and Reflector Mage to pressure the opponent, the deck aims to establish board presence quickly and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The use of tribal synergies and disruptive elements create a highly aggressive and synergistic playstyle."
