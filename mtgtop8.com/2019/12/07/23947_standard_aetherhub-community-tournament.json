The deck also includes counterspells like Ionize, Quench, and Negate to disrupt opponent's game plan. Ral's Outburst provides card advantage and removal, while Brineborn Cutthroat can grow into a threatening creature. The few removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire and Blast Zone help deal with creatures and troublesome permanents. This deck aims to outvalue the opponent and win through incremental advantage."
