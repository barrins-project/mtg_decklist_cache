The deck is designed to apply early pressure and force the opponent to react quickly, aiming to overwhelm them before they can stabilize. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Mishra's Bauble and Traverse the Ulvenwald to help find key cards and maintain consistency."

Once Valakut is in play, the goal is to play Scapeshift to search for more Mountain cards and trigger Valakut's ability multiple times, dealing massive damage to the opponent. The deck also includes Primeval Titan to search for lands and further accelerate the combo, creating a powerful win condition through Valakut's triggered ability."
