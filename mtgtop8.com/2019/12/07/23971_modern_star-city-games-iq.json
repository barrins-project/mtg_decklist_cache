Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Unsettled Mariner slow down the opponent's game plan, while Supreme Phantom and Drogskol Captain enhance the power of the spirit creatures. Selfless Spirit and Giver of Runes provide protection for key creatures, allowing for a strong and resilient aggro strategy. Overall, this deck aims to be fast, disruptive, and difficult for the opponent to handle."

Additionally, the deck has a toolbox of removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember, as well as counterspells in Stubborn Denial. The deck also includes valuable card selection and deck thinning with Mishra's Bauble and Thought Scour. The inclusion of Temur Battle Rage provides the potential for explosive turns to finish off the opponent quickly. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and disrupt the opponent's strategy to secure a victory."
