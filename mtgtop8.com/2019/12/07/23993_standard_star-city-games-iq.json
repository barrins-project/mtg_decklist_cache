Card advantage is maintained through draw spells like Opt and Chemister's Insight, while Teferi, Time Raveler disrupts the opponent's game plan. The win condition is to outvalue the opponent with powerful Instants and Sorceries, supported by cards like Gadwick, the Wizened and Brazen Borrower, ultimately securing victory through sheer control and resource management."
