The deck utilizes cards like Dark Ritual and Lotus Petal to ramp up mana quickly and combo off in the early turns of the game. Cabal Therapy and Unmask are used to disrupt opponents and clear the way for your reanimation spells. The overall goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures before they can establish a board presence."

The deck includes counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect the combo, as well as card draw spells like Ponder and Preordain to find the key pieces. Additionally, Teferi, Time Raveler can be used to disrupt the opponent's strategy and allow for more efficient plays. The overall goal is to ramp up quickly and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
