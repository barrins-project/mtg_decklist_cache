By ramping with Urza lands and Expedition Map, the deck can quickly deploy threats like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer. Chalice of the Void disrupts the opponent's game plan, while Karn, the Great Creator provides additional versatility and utility. The deck also includes removal options like Dismember and Warping Wail to deal with threats. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and efficient Eldrazi creatures while controlling the game with disruptive spells and artifacts."
