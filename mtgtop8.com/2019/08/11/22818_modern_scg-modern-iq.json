By constantly recurring creatures from the graveyard, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and summon powerful threats like Vengevine. Assassin's Trophy and Fatal Push provide removal options, while the land base helps fix mana for the diverse range of spells in the deck."

The inclusion of cards like Eternal Witness and Postmortem Lunge allows for recursion and flexibility in different situations. Overall, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo while providing support through creature toolbox options."
