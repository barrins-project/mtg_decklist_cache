            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly flooding the board with Goblins and using Aether Vial to cheat them into play. The Goblins benefit from various tribal synergies to increase their power and effectiveness, with cards like Goblin Warchief reducing their cost and Goblin Piledriver becoming a huge threat. Key cards like Goblin Ringleader and Munitions Expert provide card advantage and removal, while cards like Krenko, Mob Boss and Sling-Gang Lieutenant can generate additional tokens for a powerful attack. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast aggressive strategy."
