By utilizing cards like Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis and Vengevine, the deck can quickly overwhelm opponents and win the game in just a few turns. In addition, including Leyline of the Void helps disrupt opponents' graveyard strategies, while Assassin's Trophy and Lightning Axe provide removal options.
