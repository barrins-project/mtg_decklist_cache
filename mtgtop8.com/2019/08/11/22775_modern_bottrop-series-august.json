            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively burn the opponent with direct damage spells and early creatures, aiming to quickly reduce their life total to zero. By utilizing efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, along with fast creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a defense. The inclusion of cards like Boros Charm and Eidolon of the Great Revel adds versatility and disruption to the strategy, making it a powerful and consistent aggressive force in the Modern format."

The deck also aims to maintain card advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Opt, while using Field of Ruin to disrupt opponent's mana base. Supreme Verdict provides a board wipe option, while cards like Force of Negation and Mana Leak help protect your own threats. Overall, the key goal is to out-value and out-last your opponent until you can secure a win condition."
