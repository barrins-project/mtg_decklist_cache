By utilizing mana dorks like Llanowar Elves and Priest of Titania, the deck aims to ramp up its mana production to play out multiple threats in a single turn. Timberwatch Elf and Elvish Vanguard provide powerful pump effects to overwhelm the opponent, while cards like Wellwisher provide a source of lifegain to outlast opponents. The inclusion of Viridian Longbow allows for removal options against opposing threats."
