            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing the synergy and tribal abilities of Merfolk creatures to quickly overwhelm opponents with aggressive and efficient board presence. By leveraging Lord of Atlantis, Master of the Pearl Trident, and Merfolk Mistbinder to boost the power of all Merfolk creatures, along with disruptive cards like Merfolk Trickster and Echoing Truth, the deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents. The use of Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, while Spreading Seas disrupts opponent's mana bases. The deck's mana base supports its aggressive strategy with a mix of lands that enable smooth gameplay."
