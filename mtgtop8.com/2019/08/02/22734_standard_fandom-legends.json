The deck aims to build up a board of lands, especially Field of the Dead, and eventually win the game with a massive Scapeshift. The deck also utilizes Hydroid Krasis for card draw and life gain. Overall, the strategy is to stall the game until the deck can overwhelm the opponent with a powerful Scapeshift combo."
