The deck aims to quickly ramp up mana through cards like Exploration and Mox Diamond, while also recurring valuable lands with Life from the Loam. Punishing Fire serves as a versatile removal spell, with the ability to be repeatedly brought back from the graveyard. The inclusion of Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage offers a powerful win condition, allowing the player to create a lethal 20/20 creature in just a few turns. Overall, the deck seeks to dominate the game by managing lands effectively and out-grinding opponents."

This allows the deck to quickly overwhelm the opponent with massive creatures and powerful abilities, often ending the game in a single turn. The deck also includes various control elements such as Teferi, Time Raveler, Thoughtseize, and Force of Will to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's strategy."
