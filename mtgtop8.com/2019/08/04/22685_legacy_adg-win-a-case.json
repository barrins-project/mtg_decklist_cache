Meanwhile, the deck aims to assemble the powerful combo of Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage to quickly generate a lethal 20/20 creature token. The inclusion of Life from the Loam provides recurring value and card advantage, making it a versatile and resilient control deck."

The goal is to set up for a powerful combo turn, where the player can effectively \"storm off\" by chaining together spells like Infernal Tutor and Tendrils of Agony to deal a lethal amount of damage to their opponent in one turn. The deck also includes disruption in the form of discard spells like Duress and Thoughtseize to protect its combo."
