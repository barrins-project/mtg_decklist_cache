It aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures, burn spells, and card advantage through cantrips like Faithless Looting and Light Up the Stage. Blood Moon helps disrupt opponents' mana bases while also benefiting the deck, and supportive cards like Gut Shot, Lava Dart, and Lightning Bolt provide quick removal and reach. The deck aims to quickly close out games by constantly applying pressure and burning opponents down."
