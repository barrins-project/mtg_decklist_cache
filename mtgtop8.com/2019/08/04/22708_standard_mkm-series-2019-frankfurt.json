The main strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures like Knight of the Ebon Legion, Adanto Vanguard, and Legion Lieutenant, while using Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord to bring them back from the graveyard. The deck also uses removal spells like Cast Down and Mortify to clear the path for its creatures to attack. The key concept of this deck is to apply constant pressure on the opponent and win the game quickly."
