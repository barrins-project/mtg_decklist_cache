The deck aims to control the board with powerful planeswalkers like Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, while utilizing cards like Wurmcoil Engine and Oblivion Stone to stabilize the battlefield. Additionally, Karn, the Great Creator can shut down opponent's artifacts, making it difficult for them to execute their game plan. The deck also includes ways to search for key pieces and disrupt opponent's strategies, making it a formidable control archetype in Modern 1 vs 1 format."
