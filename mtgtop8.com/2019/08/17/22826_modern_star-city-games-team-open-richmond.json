By combining Karn, the Great Creator with artifacts like Mystic Forge and Mishra's Bauble, the deck can manipulate the board state and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Chalice of the Void and Ensnaring Bridge provide additional control elements, while cards like Expedition Map and Inventors' Fair help find key pieces of the Tron lands. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents through careful resource management and strategic planning."

The deck aims to protect its infect creatures like Glistener Elf and Blighted Agent with Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense, while also disrupting the opponent's spells with Spell Pierce. The deck also includes additional pump spells like Scale Up and Distortion Strike to further increase the infect damage output. Overall, the deck's strategy revolves around setting up a lethal attack with infect creatures and pump spells to win the game quickly."
