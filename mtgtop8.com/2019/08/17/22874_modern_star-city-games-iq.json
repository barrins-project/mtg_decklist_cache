By using Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient creature-based strategy. Cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Thalia's Lieutenant help to further disrupt the opponent's game plan while buffing your own creatures. With a mix of disruption and aggression, this deck aims to take control of the game early and maintain pressure throughout."
