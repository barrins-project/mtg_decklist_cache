Additionally, utilizing Nexus of Fate allows for extra turns to further cement its advantage. The deck's versatile land base ensures consistency in casting its spells and activating Field of the Dead for additional win conditions."

The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thought Erasure and Narset, while also sweeping the board with cards like Kaya's Wrath. The deck can draw cards efficiently with Drawn from Dreams and Search for Azcanta, and finish off the opponent with powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Liliana, Dreadhorde General. Ultimately, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind out a win through control and card advantage."
