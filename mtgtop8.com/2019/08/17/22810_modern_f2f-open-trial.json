The synergy between cards like Soul-Scar Mage and Monastery Swiftspear enhances the deck's ability to consistently apply pressure and close out games swiftly. The inclusion of cards like Bedlam Reveler and Light Up the Stage ensures that the deck can maintain momentum and keep up the pressure throughout the game."
