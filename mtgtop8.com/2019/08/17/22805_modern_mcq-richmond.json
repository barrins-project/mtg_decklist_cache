By discarding cards and sacrificing creatures, the player can efficiently bring back creatures like Gravecrawler and Bloodghast while also maximizing the potential of cards like Vengevine and Hogaak. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of creatures and disrupt their game plan through targeted removal and efficient creature recursion. The combination of graveyard synergies and creature sacrifice mechanics creates a potent and aggressive strategy in Modern 1 vs 1 matches."
