The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while gradually building up its own resources and eventually closing out the game with powerful finishers like Celestial Colonnade or Jace, the Mind Sculptor. By carefully managing resources and controlling the pace of the game, this deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver its opponents in a slow, methodical manner."
