            "notes": "This deck focuses on putting early pressure on the opponent with powerful creatures like Tarmogoyf and Bloodbraid Elf, while disrupting their game plan with removal spells and hand disruption. The Planeswalkers, Liliana of the Veil and Wrenn and Six, provide additional value and control over the game. The deck aims to control the board state and deal damage quickly to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. This aggressive strategy is complemented by efficient removal spells to handle threats and protect your own creatures. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistency and to support the powerful multicolor spells in the deck."
