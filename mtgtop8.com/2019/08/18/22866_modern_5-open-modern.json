By combining these cards with Scapeshift, the goal is to quickly assemble a powerful combo that deals massive amounts of damage to the opponent. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Lightning Bolt and removal spells like Sweltering Suns and Anger of the Gods to control the board and protect the combo. Relic of Progenitus is used to disrupt opponent graveyards and keep the combo intact."
