It combines aggressive creatures like Thing in the Ice with card draw spells and cheap instants/sorceries to consistently bring back Arclight Phoenix from the graveyard. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of fast creatures and burn spells, while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Surgical Extraction. The deck aims to close out games quickly and efficiently before the opponent can stabilize."

            "notes": "This Modern Urza control deck focuses on using artifacts to control the game, assemble infinite thopter tokens with Sword of the Meek and Thopter Foundry, and ultimately win through attrition or combo. Key cards include Urza, Lord High Artificer, Thopter Foundry, and Whir of Invention to tutor for important artifacts such as Ensnaring Bridge or Damping Sphere. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating value and advantage through artifact synergy and mana acceleration with Mox Opal and Mishra's Bauble."
