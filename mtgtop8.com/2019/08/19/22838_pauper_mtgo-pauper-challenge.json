By playing multiple one-drop creatures like Lagonna-Band Trailblazer and Deftblade Elite, the deck aims to build a strong board presence early on. With cards like Ethereal Armor and Cho-Manno's Blessing to pump up these creatures, as well as protection spells like Spare from Evil and Act of Heroism, the deck can maintain pressure and protect its creatures. This strategy allows for a swift and efficient victory against slower opponents."

By utilizing efficient and direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt, Fireblast, and Lava Spike, along with creatures like Thermo-Alchemist and Spear Spewer to continually chip away at the opponent's life total, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize or mount a defense."
