By utilizing cards like Neoform and Eldritch Evolution, the deck can consistently tutor for the pieces needed for the combo. The deck aims to win the game quickly by overwhelming the opponent with big creatures and potentially drawing the entire deck using Laboratory Maniac's ability. The deck also includes protective elements like Pact of Negation to ensure the combo goes off successfully."
