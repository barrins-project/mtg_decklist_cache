It includes a variety of counterspells like Force of Negation and Mana Leak, removal spells like Path to Exile and Wrath of God, as well as card advantage engines like Teferi, Time Raveler and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan, control the board, and ultimately win through incremental advantage and out-valuing the opponent. The mana base is designed to support the control elements and provide consistency in casting spells."
