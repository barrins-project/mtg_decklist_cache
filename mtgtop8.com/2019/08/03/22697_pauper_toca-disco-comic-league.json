By sacrificing artifacts like Terrarion and Ichor Wellspring, the deck can dig deeper into the library with cards like Thoughtcast and Perilous Research. Along with powerful creatures like Myr Enforcer and Atog, the key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of fast-moving threats and finish them off with cards like Temur Battle Rage and Fling. The mana base is optimized for maximum efficiency with lands that can tap for multiple colors and artifacts that can fix mana."
