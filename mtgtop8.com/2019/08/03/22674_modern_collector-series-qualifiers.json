The deck also utilizes cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Ghirapur Aether Grid to stall the opponent's attacks and maintain board control. With the ability to tutor for specific artifacts with Whir of Invention, this deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent in the long game."

Ranger-Captain of Eos is used to tutor for Death's Shadow or other important creatures. The deck has a disruption package in the form of Tidehollow Sculler, Thoughtseize, and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Removal spells like Path to Exile and Fatal Push help control the board while cards like Nihil Spellbomb provide graveyard hate. The deck aims to be aggressive and efficient in its game plan."
