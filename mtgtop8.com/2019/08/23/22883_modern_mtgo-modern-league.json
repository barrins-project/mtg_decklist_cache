The deck aims to ramp up mana with Sakura-Tribe Elder and utilize the toolbox of cards available through Bring to Light to answer any threats on the board. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Kaya, Orzhov Usurper to further control the game and outvalue the opponent."
