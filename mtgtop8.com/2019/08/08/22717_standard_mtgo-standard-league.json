The key strategy is to eventually overwhelm the opponent with zombies generated from Field of the Dead and finish the game with a powerful Scapeshift combo. Teferi, Time Raveler provides additional control tools, while Drawn from Dreams helps find key cards. The deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a strong board presence and secure a victory through a combination of control and big mana plays."
