It also includes disruption in the form of hand disruption spells like Duress and Thoughtseize, as well as removal spells like Abrupt Decay. The deck aims to win the game quickly by creating a powerful threat that is difficult for opponents to deal with."

The deck includes cards like Elvish Reclaimer, Crop Rotation, and Vampire Hexmage to search for and accelerate the combo. Additionally, the deck features disruption elements such as Cabal Therapy and Thoughtseize to control the opponent's hand. This deck aims to quickly assemble the combo while disrupting the opponent's game plan to secure victory."
