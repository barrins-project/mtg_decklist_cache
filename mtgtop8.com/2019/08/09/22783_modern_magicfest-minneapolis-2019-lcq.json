The deck revolves around the synergy between lands that produce multiple mana (such as bounce lands) and cards that untap them (such as Amulet of Vigor) to generate massive mana advantage. This enables you to tutor for key lands or threats with cards like Tolaria West and Trinket Mage, ultimately setting up explosive turns to overwhelm your opponent and secure victory."

With burn spells like Lava Spike, Lightning Bolt, and Lava Dart, the deck can deal direct damage to the opponent while also enabling the recursion of Arclight Phoenix from the graveyard. Overall, this deck is focused on applying pressure and closing out the game quickly."

The deck also includes cantrips like Serum Visions and Opt to help filter through the deck and find combo pieces, with Gifts Ungiven acting as a versatile toolbox to set up the combo. The goal is to efficiently cycle through the deck and storm off for a lethal finish."
