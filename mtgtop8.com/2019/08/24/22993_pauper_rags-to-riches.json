Cards like Hunger of the Howlpack and Rancor help pump up these creatures, while spells like Savage Swipe and Lightning Bolt provide removal and combat tricks. The inclusion of Arcum's Astrolabe and Snow-Covered lands ensures consistent mana fixing. Overall, the deck aims to win the game quickly by being aggressive and proactive."
