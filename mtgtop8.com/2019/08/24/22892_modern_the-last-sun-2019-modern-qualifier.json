The aggressive creatures, like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage, provide early pressure and help close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The deck's goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast damage and close out the game quickly."

The deck also includes cards like Mesmeric Orb and Manic Scribe to continue milling each turn. It includes disruption cards like Fatal Push and Surgical Extraction to control the board and prevent the opponent from stopping the mill strategy. The deck also has some toolbox cards like Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver and Scheming Symmetry to help find key pieces of the combo. The overall goal is to mill the opponent's library before they can defeat you."
