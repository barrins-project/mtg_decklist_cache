This is supported by cards like Crop Rotation, Sylvan Scrying, and Green Sun's Zenith to tutor for the combo pieces. In addition, disruption is provided through cards like Thoughtseize, Duress, Abrupt Decay, and Assassin's Trophy. The rest of the deck is dedicated to mana acceleration and protection, such as Lotus Petal, Elvish Spirit Guide, Sylvan Safekeeper, and Wasteland. The goal is to assemble the combo as quickly as possible while disrupting the opponent's game plan."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Stifle and Wasteland, while also utilizing the card advantage provided by cards like Brainstorm and Wrenn and Six to outvalue the opponent. The combination of disruption, aggression, and card advantage allows this deck to quickly close out games against slower and more controlling decks."
