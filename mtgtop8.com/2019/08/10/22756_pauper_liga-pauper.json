            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing low-cost creatures to maintain board presence and control spells to disrupt the opponent's strategy. By combining aggressive creatures like Faerie Seer and Ninja of the Deep Hours with efficient removal spells like Skred and Journey to Nowhere, the deck can apply pressure while keeping the opponent on the back foot. The inclusion of counter spells like Counterspell also allows the deck to protect its own game plan while disrupting the opponent's. The mana base is optimized for consistency and enables the use of powerful utility lands like Ancient Den."
