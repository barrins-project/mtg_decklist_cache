By utilizing a combination of low-cost creatures, anthem effects, and powerful vampire synergies, the deck aims to build a wide board presence and apply constant pressure. Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord provides additional utility and reach with his abilities, while removal spells like Cast Down and Legion's End help clear the way for the swarm of creatures. The deck's key strategy is to curve out smoothly, establish a dominant board position, and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
