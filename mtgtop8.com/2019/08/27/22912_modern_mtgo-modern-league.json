The deck also utilizes search and tutoring effects like Whir of Invention and Mishra's Bauble to ensure consistency and find the necessary pieces. Additionally, the deck has some graveyard hate with Tormod's Crypt and can recurr valuable artifacts with Crucible of Worlds and Academy Ruins. Overall, the focus is on control and resource denial, with a strong emphasis on artifacts for synergy and utility."

It utilizes a combination of creatures with enter the battlefield abilities, such as Tidehollow Sculler and Deputy of Detention, as well as value creatures like Eternal Witness and Scavenging Ooze. The deck also takes advantage of synergies between cards like Flickerwisp and Eldrazi Displacer to control the board and generate incremental advantage. The mana base is designed to support the multiple color requirements of the deck while also incorporating powerful lands like Eldrazi Temple and Horizon Canopy."
