Teferi, Time Raveler and Deputy of Detention provide control elements to protect your board and disrupt the opponent's strategy, while Trostani Discordant and Voracious Hydra offer additional threats and options for closing out the game quickly. The deck aims to be aggressive and explosive, leveraging the synergy between its creatures and planeswalkers for a powerful aggro strategy."
