It also utilizes cards like Teferi, Time Raveler to disrupt the opponent's game plan and Ice-Fang Coatl for additional card draw and possible removal. The goal is to survive the early game, disrupt the opponent's strategy, and then win the game with a powerful combo finish."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's hand with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, while removing threats with removal spells like Fatal Push and Assassin's Trophy. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to further disrupt the opponent's game plan. The creatures in the deck, such as Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant, are strong threats that can quickly close out the game if left unchecked."
