By utilizing efficient counterspells like Rune Snag and Mana Leak, alongside bounce spells like Unsummon and Vapor Snag, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building up a board presence with cards like Supreme Phantom, Rattlechains, and other Spirit creatures. The goal is to maintain control of the battlefield and deal damage to the opponent rapidly, utilizing the card advantage from Jace, Wielder of Mysteries as a potential alternate win condition."
