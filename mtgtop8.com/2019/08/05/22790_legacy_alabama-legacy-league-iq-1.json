The deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Narset, Parter of Veils to control the board and win the game. Removal spells like Fatal Push, Lightning Bolt, and Angrath's Rampage help deal with threats, while countermagic in the form of Force of Will provides additional protection. The deck aims to control the game and outvalue the opponent to secure victory."
