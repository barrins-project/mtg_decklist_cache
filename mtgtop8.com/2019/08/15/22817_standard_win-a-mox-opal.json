By curving out early with efficient creatures like Skymarcher Aspirant and Adanto Vanguard, the deck aims to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total and overwhelm them with damage, while also using cards like Legion's End and Mortify to control the opponent's board presence. Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord serves as both a powerful pump effect and a way to consistently trigger lifelink and other synergies within the deck."
