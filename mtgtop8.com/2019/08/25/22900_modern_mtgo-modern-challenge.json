With cards like Thoughtseize, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Liliana of the Veil for disruption, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also applying pressure with aggressive creatures like Tarmogoyf, Bloodbraid Elf, and Scavenging Ooze. The deck also has flexibility with cards like Assassin's Trophy and Kolaghan's Command for removal and interaction. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and allow for consistent casting of spells."
