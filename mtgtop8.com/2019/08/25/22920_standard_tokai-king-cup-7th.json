Mayhem Devil and Judith, the Scourge Diva enhance the deck's ability to deal damage to both creatures and the opponent. Rekindling Phoenix provides a resilient threat, while cards like Lightning Strike and Chandra, Acolyte of Flame offer direct damage and card advantage. Tibalt, Rakish Instigator disrupts opposing strategies, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize."
