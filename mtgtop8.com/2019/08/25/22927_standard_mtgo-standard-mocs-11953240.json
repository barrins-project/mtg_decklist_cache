The key strategy is to play low-cost creatures like Tenth District Legionnaire and Dreadhorde Arcanist, then use spells like Defiant Strike and Gods Willing to pump them up and protect them. Season of Growth helps to draw more cards and maintain hand advantage. Feather, the Redeemed allows for spell recursion, while Domri's Ambush and Reckless Rage provide removal options. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient threats while maintaining card advantage."

With cards like Nicol Bolas, the Ravager and Nicol Bolas, Dragon-God providing card advantage and versatile abilities, along with removal spells like Bedevil and Ritual of Soot to handle threats, the deck aims to slow down the game and outvalue the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Thought Erasure helps to disrupt the opponent's hand and restrict their options, while maintaining a consistent mana base for casting powerful spells."
