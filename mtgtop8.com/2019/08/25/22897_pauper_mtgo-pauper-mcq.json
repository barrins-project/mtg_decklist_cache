The deck focuses on efficient mana production with cards like Springleaf Drum and Prophetic Prism, while also utilizing burn spells like Galvanic Blast to finish off the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Flayer Husk and Carapace Forger helps to provide additional protection and resilience to the aggro strategy."
