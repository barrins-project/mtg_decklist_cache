            "notes": "This Bomberman combo deck focuses on generating infinite mana and recurring artifacts to create a powerful board presence. By using Auriok Salvagers to loop Lion's Eye Diamond, players can produce infinite mana and use it to cast Walking Ballista for a lethal finish. Monastery Mentor provides additional value by creating Monk tokens with each non-creature spell cast. Karn, the Great Creator can lock opponents out of the game with artifacts and Mystic Forge allows for card advantage and filtering. The deck is designed to quickly assemble the combo and overwhelm opponents with a powerful finish."

The mana base is streamlined to ensure consistency and the inclusion of cards like Dreadhorde Arcanist and True-Name Nemesis provide additional threats to overwhelm the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to win quickly through a combination of aggression and disruption."
