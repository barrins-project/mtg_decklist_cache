The deck aims to quickly disrupt the opponent's game plan and close out the game as fast as possible. The inclusion of cards like Wrenn and Six and Dreadhorde Arcanist provide additional value and utility to the deck, allowing for repeated spellcasting and recursion. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements while also utilizing land destruction with cards like Wasteland."
