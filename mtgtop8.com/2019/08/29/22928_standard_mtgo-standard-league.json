Tamiyo, Collector of Tales and Search for Azcanta help to find your combo pieces and provide card advantage. The deck also includes some control elements like Root Snare and Blast Zone to survive until you can assemble your combo. Overall, the key strategy is to create a powerful engine that allows you to take infinite turns and overwhelm your opponent."
