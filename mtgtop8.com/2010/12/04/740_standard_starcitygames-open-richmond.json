By slowly building up mana and controlling the board with cards like Day of Judgment and Ratchet Bomb, the deck aims to eventually overpower the opponent with powerful finishers like Gideon Jura and Celestial Colonnade. This strategy requires patience and careful decision-making to outlast and outvalue the opponent."

By ramping up your mana with cards like Cultivate and Everflowing Chalice, you can quickly play out your high-cost threats like Frost Titan and Primeval Titan. Destructive Force serves as a game-ending finisher, clearing the board of your opponent's creatures while leaving your powerful Titans unscathed. With a mix of card draw and land manipulation, this deck aims to dominate the late game and overwhelm your opponent."
