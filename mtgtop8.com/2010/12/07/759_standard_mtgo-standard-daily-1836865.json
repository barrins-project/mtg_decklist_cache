Cards like Honor of the Pure boost the power of all white creatures, while Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and control. Baneslayer Angel and Transcendent Master serve as powerful late game finishers. The deck aims to maintain board presence and apply pressure to the opponent, ultimately leading to victory through aggressive play and strategic decision-making."
