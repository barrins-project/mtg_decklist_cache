By efficiently managing resources and responding to threats with cards like Cancel, Lightning Bolt, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, the player aims to gain card advantage and stabilize the game. Additionally, Frost Titan and Destructive Force provide powerful threats and board control options, while the inclusion of cards like Pyroclasm and Terramorphic Expanse help deal with aggressive strategies. The deck excels at disrupting the opponent's game plan and establishing control of the game."
