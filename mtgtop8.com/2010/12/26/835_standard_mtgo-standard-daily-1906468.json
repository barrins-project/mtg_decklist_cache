The deck aims to dominate the board state and outvalue the opponent in a long, grindy game."

The deck focuses on playing defensively with cards like Wall of Omens and Day of Judgment to control the board while gradually building card advantage with Jace, the Mind Sculptor and other card draw effects. The win condition of the deck is to ultimately overpower the opponent with powerful planeswalker cards like Gideon Jura and Elspeth Tirel, or by attacking with creatures like Celestial Colonnade. The deck also utilizes land disruption and control with cards like Spreading Seas and Tectonic Edge."
