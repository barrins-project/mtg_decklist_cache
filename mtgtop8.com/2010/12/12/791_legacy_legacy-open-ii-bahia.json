By efficiently using direct damage spells like Chain Lightning, Fireblast, and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to outpace the opponent and end the game before they have a chance to stabilize. The emphasis on mountains and instant-speed burn spells allows for consistent and fast aggression, making it difficult for the opponent to keep up with the onslaught of damage."
