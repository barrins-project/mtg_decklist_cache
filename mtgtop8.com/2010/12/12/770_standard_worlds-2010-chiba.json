The deck also aims to maintain card advantage through drawing and filtering with cards like Sea Gate Oracle, Preordain, and Jace Beleren. The win condition is through gradual damage with creatures like Grave Titan and creeping damage with land creatures like Creeping Tar Pit."

By using cards like Harrow, Cultivate, and Khalni Heart Expedition, the deck can quickly get to its endgame threats. Lightning Bolt provides removal while Oracle of Mul Daya helps with card advantage. Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle serves as a win condition, dealing massive damage when enough Mountains are in play. Overall, the deck aims to control the game while setting up a powerful late game board presence."
