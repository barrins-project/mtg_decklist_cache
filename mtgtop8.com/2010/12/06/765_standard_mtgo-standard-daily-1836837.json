The key strategy is to swarm the board with fast Vampires like Bloodghast and Pulse Tracker, while using cards like Gatekeeper of Malakir and Lightning Bolt to clear the way for direct attacks. The inclusion of control elements like Inquisition of Kozilek and Mark of Mutiny helps disrupt the opponent's plans, while the sword provides additional damage and protection. The deck aims to win the game swiftly before the opponent can stabilize."
