            "notes": "This deck revolves around utilizing the \"Show and Tell\" card to cheat huge, game-winning creatures like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Progenitus into play. It aims to quickly ramp up mana with cards like Chrome Mox and Ancient Tomb, while also controlling the game with counter spells like Force of Will and Spell Snare. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures early in the game, often securing a quick victory before the opponent can react effectively. The deck also includes some disruptive elements like Blood Moon to further disrupt the opponent's game plan."
