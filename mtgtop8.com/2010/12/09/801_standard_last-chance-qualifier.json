By using cards like Cultivate, Explore and Harrow, the deck aims to efficiently accelerate its mana base to cast large threats like Avenger of Zendikar and Oracle of Mul Daya. Pyroclasm provides board control against aggressive decks, while Summoning Trap acts as a powerful way to cheat out big creatures. Overall, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful land synergies."
