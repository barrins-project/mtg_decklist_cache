Oracle of Mul Daya helps to play additional lands each turn, further fueling the Valakut engine. The deck also includes Lightning Bolt for removal and Summoning Trap as a potential surprise to cheat in big creatures."

The deck aims to control the board through cards like Day of Judgment and Journey to Nowhere, while also creating a win condition with Luminarch Ascension. By managing the opponent's threats and resources, the deck can outlast its opponent and secure victory through attrition. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the mind sculptor and Elspeth Tirel provide additional value and control options."
