It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while slowly building up its own resources and win conditions. By efficiently managing the board and using powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Elspeth Tirel, the deck looks to establish dominance and secure victory through attrition and smart decision-making. The land base is designed to support the control strategy and provide flexibility in utilizing various spells and abilities."
