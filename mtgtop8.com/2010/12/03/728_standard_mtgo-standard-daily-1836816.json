The key strategy involves disrupting the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Mana Leak and Stoic Rebuttal, while using card draw from cards like Wall of Omens and Jace Beleren to maintain card advantage. Baneslayer Angel and Sun Titan provide threats that can quickly close out the game, while board wipes like Day of Judgment keep the opponent's board in check. Ultimately, the goal is to out-value and out-tempo the opponent until victory is achieved."
