By using cards like Mana Leak and Condemn to disrupt their opponent's game plan, while generating card advantage and board presence with planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura, the deck aims to out-grind and out-value the opponent. The deck also includes versatile cards like Celestial Colonnade and Tectonic Edge to help maintain control of the battlefield and secure the win."
