Planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura provide additional card advantage and removal options. With a mix of creature threats and powerful control spells, this deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent in a grindy match-up, ultimately leading to victory through attrition and careful resource management."
