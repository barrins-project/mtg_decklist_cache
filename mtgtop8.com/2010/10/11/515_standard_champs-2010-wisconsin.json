The key strategy is to stall the opponent's threats with cards like Wall of Omens and Condemn while generating card advantage with Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Jace Beleren. Mana Leak and Deprive are used to counter key spells, while Day of Judgment serves as a board wipe. Sun Titan and Gideon Jura provide win conditions and additional utility. The mana base supports the deck's color requirements and helps control the opponent's resources."
