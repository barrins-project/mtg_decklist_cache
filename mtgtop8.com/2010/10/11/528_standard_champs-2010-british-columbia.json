This is achieved through a combination of ramp spells such as Cultivate and Explore, as well as creatures like Overgrown Battlement and Primeval Titan. Once Valakut is active, the deck can finish off opponents with the powerful landfall ability to deal significant damage with each Mountain that enters the battlefield. Additional threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Inferno Titan provide backup options for closing out games."
