By using cards like Steppe Lynx, Plated Geopede, and Emeria Angel to trigger landfall abilities, along with equipment such as Basilisk Collar and Adventuring Gear, the deck aims to deal consistent damage quickly. Cards like Journey to Nowhere and Lightning Bolt provide removal options, while Stoneforge Mystic can search for key equipment pieces. Overall, the deck focuses on aggression and efficient creature plays to overwhelm opponents."
