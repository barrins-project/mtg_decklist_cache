The key win condition revolves around Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle, which deals damage based on the number of mountains in play each time a mountain enters the battlefield. By controlling the board and consistently ramping up mana, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and burn spells fueled by Valakut's volcanic power."
