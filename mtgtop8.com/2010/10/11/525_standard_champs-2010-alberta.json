By utilizing cards like Cancel, Mana Leak, and Stoic Rebuttal, the player can prevent threats from resolving while also keeping the opponent's board clear with removal spells like Condemn and Journey to Nowhere. Card advantage is gained through Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Jace Beleren, allowing the player to dig deeper into their deck and find answers. The win condition of the deck is to stall the game until a late-game threat like Gideon Jura or Wurmcoil Engine can close out the game."

The deck includes mana accelerants like Birds of Paradise and Lotus Cobra to ramp up mana quickly, while also incorporating disruption with cards like Mana Leak and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. Vengevine serves as a key threat that can be easily brought back from the graveyard, and cards like Frost Titan and Inferno Titan provide additional firepower. The inclusion of Trinket Mage allows for additional utility by searching for key artifacts like Basilisk Collar or Brittle Effigy. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with aggressive plays and efficient creature synergies."
