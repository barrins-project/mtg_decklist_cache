Cards like Goblin Guide, Plated Geopede, and Kiln Fiend help to pressure the opponent early on, while burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Burst Lightning provide additional reach to finish the game. The deck aims to establish board control and maintain pressure throughout the game to close out the match as quickly as possible."
