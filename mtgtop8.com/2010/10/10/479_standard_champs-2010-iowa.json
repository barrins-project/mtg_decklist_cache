The goal is to survive the early game with removal and counterspells, then stabilize with powerful threats like Sun Titan and Celestial Colonnade. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and control, while Gideon Jura helps protect against aggressive strategies. This deck excels in long, grindy games where patience and careful decision-making are key."

Trinket Mage is used to tutor for key artifacts like Everflowing Chalice. The deck also has ways to gain life and protect itself with cards like Elixir of Immortality and Venser, the Sojourner. The overall strategy is to outvalue the opponent and control the game until a win condition can be established."
