Fauna Shaman serves as a toolbox to tutor for specific creatures in different situations. The inclusion of removal spells like Journey to Nowhere and Cunning Sparkmage helps to control the opponent's board while continuing to press the aggression. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and combat tricks."

Avenger of Zendikar and Wurmcoil Engine provide additional threats on the board while Summoning Trap can help cheat out a Primeval Titan or Avenger of Zendikar for added value. Lightning Bolt provides removal and Raging Ravine is an additional win condition."
