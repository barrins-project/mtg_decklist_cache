The deck utilizes cards like Primeval Titan and Oracle of Mul Daya to ramp up lands quickly and trigger Valakut's ability. Cards like Pyroclasm provide control and protection while cards like Avenger of Zendikar and Wurmcoil Engine provide threats and additional value. The goal is to stall the game until Valakut can close out the match with a devastating amount of direct damage."
