The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of elf creatures and use cards like Eldrazi Monument and Garruk Wildspeaker to boost their power and protect them. Tajuru Preserver helps protect against sacrifice effects, while Nissa Revane and Nissa's Chosen provide additional support. The deck also includes cards like Genesis Wave and Tectonic Edge for added versatility and disruption."
