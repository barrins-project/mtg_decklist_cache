The combination of counter spells, card draw, and versatile removal options allows for both offense and defense strategies. The mana base is carefully constructed to support a diverse range of spells, with a focus on powerful blue and white spells. By combining aggression with disruption, this deck aims to quickly establish dominance on the board and maintain control throughout the game."
