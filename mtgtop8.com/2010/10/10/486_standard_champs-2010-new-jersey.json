The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan, controlling the board state, and winning through attrition. Cards like Mana Leak, Day of Judgment, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor provide the tools to control the game, while finishers like Baneslayer Angel and Sun Titan give the deck a way to close out the game once it has gained control."
