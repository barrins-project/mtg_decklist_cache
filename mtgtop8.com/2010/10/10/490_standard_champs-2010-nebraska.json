The win condition comes from dropping powerful threats like Frost Titan, Wurmcoil Engine, and Destructive Force to overpower the opponent. Jace helps with card advantage and controlling the game, while Volition Reins and Mystifying Maze offer additional control options. The deck aims to outvalue and outcontrol the opponent to secure victory."
