The main win condition is Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle which deals damage based on the number of Mountains in play. Cards like Cultivate, Harrow, and Khalni Heart Expedition help to quickly get more Mountains on the board. The deck also includes cards like Oracle of Mul Daya and Avenger of Zendikar for additional value and card advantage. Ultimately, the goal is to control the game until Valakut can deal lethal damage to the opponent."

The deck also includes a variety of ramp spells and card draw effects to ensure it can consistently hit its land drops and find its key threats. Overall, the strategy revolves around efficiently managing resources and out-valuing opponents with high-impact plays."
