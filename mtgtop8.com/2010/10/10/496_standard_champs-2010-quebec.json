Once enough Mountains are on the battlefield, cards like Primeval Titan and Avenger of Zendikar can quickly close out the game by dealing direct damage to the opponent. Oracle of Mul Daya helps to ensure consistent land drops, while cards like Lightning Bolt provide additional removal options. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and burn spells while maintaining control of the battlefield."
