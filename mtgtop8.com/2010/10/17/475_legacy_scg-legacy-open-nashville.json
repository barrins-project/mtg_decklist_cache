Utilizing a mix of countermagic like Force of Will and disruption spells like Thoughtseize, the deck aims to control the tempo of the game and maintain board presence. Key cards like Brainstorm and Ponder help to smooth out draws and dig for additional threats. Wasteland and Stifle provide additional disruption by disrupting the opponent's mana base. With a blend of aggression and disruption, this deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents in the Legacy format."

The deck also utilizes mana acceleration with Noble Hierarch and Chrome Mox to quickly get ahead in the game. Overall, the strategy is to adapt to different situations and outmaneuver the opponent."
