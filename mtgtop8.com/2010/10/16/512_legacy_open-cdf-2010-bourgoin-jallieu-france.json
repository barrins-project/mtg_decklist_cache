The key strategy is to establish a lock with Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top, allowing the player to counter spells of different converted mana costs. The deck also includes threats like Tarmogoyf and Knight of the Reliquary to pressure the opponent while maintaining control of the game. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while advancing its own win condition."
