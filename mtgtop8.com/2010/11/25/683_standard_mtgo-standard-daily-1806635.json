            "notes": "The primary focus of this Boros Landfall Aggro deck is to utilize landfall triggers to quickly build up board presence and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures. By including a mix of powerful landfall creatures like Steppe Lynx and Plated Geopede, along with efficient removal and equipment like Lightning Bolt and Sword of Body and Mind, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain that pressure throughout the game. By maximizing the potential of landfall triggers, this deck can often win games quickly and decisively."
