By playing low-cost creatures with abilities that benefit from sacrificing and dying, the deck aims to control the board while dealing consistent damage to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Blade of the Bloodchief and Gatekeeper of Malakir helps to further enhance the power of the vampire creatures. The deck's synergy and speed make it a formidable force in a 1 vs 1 Standard format."
