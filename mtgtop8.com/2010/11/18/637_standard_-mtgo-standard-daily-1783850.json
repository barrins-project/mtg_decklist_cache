Primeval Titan and Avenger of Zendikar provide powerful threats to close out the game, while Oracle of Mul Daya helps to ensure consistent land drops. Lightning Bolt offers removal and reach, while Summoning Trap can provide a game-winning surprise play. The deck aims to control the board and overwhelm the opponent with big creatures and Valakut triggers for massive damage."
