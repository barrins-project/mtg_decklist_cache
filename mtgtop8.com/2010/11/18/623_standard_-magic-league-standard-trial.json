It aims to maintain board control through a combination of cheap creatures like Elite Vanguard and Student of Warfare, and powerful anthem effects like Honor of the Pure. It also includes disruptive elements like Mana Leak and Leonin Arbiter to prevent the opponent from stabilizing. The inclusion of cards like Elspeth Tirel and Linvala, Keeper of Silence provides additional utility and late-game options. The deck utilizes a mana base of white-producing lands to ensure consistent access to its aggressive threats."
