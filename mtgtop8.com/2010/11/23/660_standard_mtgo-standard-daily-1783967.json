This allows you to deal massive amounts of damage to your opponent's creatures or directly to them. The deck also includes powerful creatures like Avenger of Zendikar and Primeval Titan to further control the board and put pressure on your opponent. Additionally, cards like Summoning Trap and Oracle of Mul Daya provide additional utility and card advantage."
