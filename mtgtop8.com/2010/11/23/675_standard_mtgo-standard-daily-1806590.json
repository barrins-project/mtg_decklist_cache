The synergy between efficient creatures and equipment allows for a fast-paced aggressive strategy that aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The deck's win condition revolves around assembling powerful artifact equipment while continuously applying pressure to force the opponent into difficult decisions."
