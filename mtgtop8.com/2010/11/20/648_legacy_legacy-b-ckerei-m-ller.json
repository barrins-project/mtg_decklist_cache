By utilizing cards like Coralhelm Commander, Lord of Atlantis, and Merrow Reejerey to pump up the team, along with Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent in the early game. With disruption spells like Daze, Force of Will, and Spell Pierce, as well as the card advantage engine Standstill, the deck can maintain tempo and pressure throughout the game."
