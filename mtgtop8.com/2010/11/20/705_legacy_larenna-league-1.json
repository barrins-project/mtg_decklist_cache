Cards like Gempalm Incinerator and Siege-Gang Commander provide removal and reach, while cards like Goblin Warchief and Goblin Chieftain pump up the team. With cards like Aether Vial helping to get creatures onto the battlefield quickly, this deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

It aims to slow down the opponent's game plan by constantly disrupting their plays and removing their threats. The deck also utilizes card draw and manipulation through cards like Brainstorm and Sensei's Divining Top to ensure consistency and find key cards when needed. The key strategy is to establish board presence through cards like Standstill and Jace, the Mind Sculptor while keeping the opponent's resources in check with cards like Force of Will and Wasteland."
