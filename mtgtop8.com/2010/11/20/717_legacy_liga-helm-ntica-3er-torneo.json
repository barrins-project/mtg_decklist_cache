Phyrexian Walker and Shield Sphere provide early defense while cards like Duress and Pact of Negation protect the combo. The inclusion of Sensei's Divining Top and Lim-Dûl's Vault help to find key combo pieces quickly. The deck is designed to win the game in one explosive turn with the storm mechanic."
