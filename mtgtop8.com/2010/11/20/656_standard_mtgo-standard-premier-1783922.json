It utilizes cards like Cultivate and Explore to accelerate land drops, while also using cards like Overgrown Battlement to generate extra mana. The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Arc Trail while also utilizing the powerful Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle to deal damage to the opponent. The creatures in the deck provide additional value with landfall triggers and can quickly overwhelm the opponent with an army of tokens."
