By utilizing mana ramp cards like Llanowar Elves and Joraga Treespeaker, the deck can quickly drop high impact creatures like Vengevine and Ezuri, Renegade Leader. The inclusion of cards like Fauna Shaman and Copperhorn Scout allows for card selection and additional creature buffs. The deck also includes cards like Eldrazi Monument and Genesis Wave for late game power plays. Overall, the deck aims to have a fast and aggressive start while maintaining board presence throughout the game."
