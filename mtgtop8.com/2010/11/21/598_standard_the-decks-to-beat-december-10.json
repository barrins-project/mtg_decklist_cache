Cards like Kalastria Highborn and Viscera Seer offer additional benefits when creatures are sacrificed, while Lightning Bolt and Burst Lightning provide direct damage to both creatures and the opponent. The inclusion of removal spells like Arc Trail and Mark of Mutiny allows for removal of threats and manipulation of the opponent's creatures. The deck also features Sword of Body and Mind as a way to generate additional threats and card advantage. Finally, Dark Tutelage assists with maintaining card advantage throughout the game."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to create a fast and aggressive playstyle by utilizing the Fauna Shaman archetype. The deck focuses on generating early mana with cards like Lotus Cobra and Birds of Paradise, and using Fauna Shaman to search for specific creatures to play. It also incorporates control elements with cards like Mana Leak and Tectonic Edge to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck includes powerful creatures like Frost Titan and Molten-Tail Masticore, as well as planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Garruk Wildspeaker to further enhance its capabilities."
