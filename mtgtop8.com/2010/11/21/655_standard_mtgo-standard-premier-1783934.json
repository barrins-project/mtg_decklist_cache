The key strategy involves using cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Sea Gate Oracle to filter through the deck, while also maintaining board presence with creatures like Abyssal Persecutor and Grave Titan. Mimic Vat provides additional value by allowing for creature recursion, giving the deck an advantage in the late game. By managing resources effectively and disrupting the opponent's game plan, this deck seeks to grind out victories through attrition."
