The deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on, supported by cards like Tarmogoyf and Knight of the Reliquary, while also disrupting the opponent's strategies with removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Lightning Bolt. Additionally, the deck has flexibility in its threats with cards like Elspeth, Knight-Errant and Figure of Destiny, allowing for different lines of attack depending on the opponent's game plan."

This allows the player to cast multiple spells in a single turn and potentially win the game through overwhelming the opponent with a large board presence. The deck also includes a toolbox of creatures that can be searched for using cards like Chord of Calling, providing flexibility and adaptability in different situations. Overall, the deck aims to quickly and efficiently combo off to secure a victory."

Once Emrakul, the Aeons Torn is in the graveyard, it can be reanimated using Dread Return to win the game. Show and Tell can also be used to cheat Emrakul into play. Cabal Therapy helps disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect your combo, while Force of Will provides additional protection. Overall, the goal is to assemble the combo pieces quickly and win the game before the opponent can respond."
