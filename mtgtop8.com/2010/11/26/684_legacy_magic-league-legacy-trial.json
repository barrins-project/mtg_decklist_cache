The deck also runs disruption in the form of Force of Will and Misdirection to protect the combo. The deck aims to quickly find the combo pieces through cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder, as well as accelerating with Dark Ritual and Lotus Petal. Show and Tell can also be used as an alternative way to cheat Hive Mind into play."
