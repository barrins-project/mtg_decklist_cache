By ramping up with Lotus Cobra and Oracle of Mul Daya, the deck aims to control the game with counterspells like Mana Leak and removal like Lightning Bolt. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Garruk Wildspeaker, along with threats like Frost Titan and Gaea's Revenge to close out the game. With a mix of ramp, control, and threats, the RUG Control deck aims to outplay and outvalue opponents in a 1 vs 1 format."
