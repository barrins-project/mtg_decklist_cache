The key strategy revolves around utilizing Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent's creatures and life total. The deck includes cards like Cultivate, Explore, and Harrow to help accelerate land drops and trigger Valakut's ability. Additionally, Lightning Bolt and Summoning Trap add versatility and removal options to maintain board control."
