These powerful creatures put pressure on the opponent, with the potential to quickly overwhelm them. Cards like Acidic Slime provide utility in dealing with opponent's threats, while cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Garruk Wildspeaker offer additional card advantage and support. Overall, the deck aims to establish board presence and push for a fast win through aggressive plays."
