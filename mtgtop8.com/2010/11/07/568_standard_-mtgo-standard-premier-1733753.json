The synergies between creatures like Glint Hawk and Kor Outfitter, as well as the recurring abilities of Kor Skyfisher, help maintain pressure on the opponent while setting up for explosive plays with your equipment. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy centered around completing your holy quest for powerful artifacts."
