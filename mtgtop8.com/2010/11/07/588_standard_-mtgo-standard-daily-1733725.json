By ramping with cards like Cultivate and Explore, the deck aims to quickly get to seven lands and start triggering Valakut's ability to deal damage to opponents. Primeval Titan and Avenger of Zendikar provide additional threats on the board, while cards like Harrow and Khalni Heart Expedition help accelerate land drops. Lightning Bolt serves as removal and reach, while Oracle of Mul Daya and Summoning Trap offer card advantage and additional threats."
