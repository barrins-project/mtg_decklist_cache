The planeswalkers, like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura, provide additional control elements and card advantage. The deck also includes card draw and creature protection with Wall of Omens and uses land destruction with Tectonic Edge to disrupt the opponent's mana base."

By utilizing cards like Eldrazi Temple and Overgrown Battlement, the deck aims to cast powerful Eldrazi creatures such as Emrakul, Kozilek, and Ulamog. The strategy involves using cards like Primeval Titan and Cultivate to search for lands and increase mana production. Additionally, cards like Summoning Trap allow for the casting of Eldrazi creatures for free. Overall, the deck focuses on overwhelming the opponent with large, powerful creatures while controlling the game through mana ramp and removal spells."
