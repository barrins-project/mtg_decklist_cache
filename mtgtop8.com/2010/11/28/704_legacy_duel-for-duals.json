Stiflenought leverages Stifle and Phyrexian Dreadnought to create a powerful threat that can be difficult for opponents to handle. The deck also incorporates card draw and manipulation through Brainstorm, Sensei's Divining Top, and Trinket Mage to find key pieces and maintain card advantage. Additionally, the mana denial strategy with Wasteland and Mishra's Factory helps to further limit the opponent's resources."

It aims to control the tempo of the game by countering opponent's spells with Daze, Force of Will, and Spell Pierce, while also maintaining card advantage with Standstill. The deck's synergy comes from its tribal theme, leveraging the abilities of Lord of Atlantis, Merrow Reejerey, and Silvergill Adept. With Aether Vial for additional creature deployment and land disruption with Wasteland, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of Merfolk creatures."
