By utilizing the landfall triggers of Valakut and Primeval Titan, the deck aims to deal incremental damage to the opponent while also maintaining board presence with cards like Avenger of Zendikar and Wurmcoil Engine. The inclusion of cards like Oracle of Mul Daya and Summoning Trap ensure that the deck has the necessary consistency and flexibility to outvalue and out tempo the opponent."
