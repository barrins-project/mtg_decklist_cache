It also utilizes Planeswalkers such as Jace Beleren and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to generate card advantage and control the board. The deck also includes win conditions like Celestial Colonnade and Sun Titan to close out the game. The mana base is designed to ensure consistency and allow for the activation of powerful lands like Tectonic Edge. Overall, the strategy revolves around controlling the game until victory can be secured."
