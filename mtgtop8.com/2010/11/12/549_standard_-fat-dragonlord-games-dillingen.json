The deck also includes cards like Pyroclasm and Lightning Bolt to control the opponent's board state and removal threats. The main finishers of the deck include Primeval Titan, Avenger of Zendikar, and Wurmcoil Engine to further pressure the opponent and secure victory."

The deck aims to quickly establish board presence with early mana acceleration from cards like Birds of Paradise and Lotus Cobra, and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive threats like Inferno Titan and Frost Titan. The inclusion of cards like Cunning Sparkmage and Basilisk Collar provide additional removal options, while cards like Trinket Mage can tutor for utility artifacts like Everflowing Chalice."
