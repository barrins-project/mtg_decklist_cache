The key win condition is to have Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle on the battlefield alongside multiple mountains and then trigger its ability to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent. The deck focuses on controlling the board with removal spells like Lightning Bolt while also setting up for a powerful end game with landfall triggers and Valakut activations."
