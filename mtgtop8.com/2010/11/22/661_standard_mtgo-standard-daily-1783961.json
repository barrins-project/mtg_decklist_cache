By controlling the game and out-valuing the opponent, UW Control seeks to win through attrition and inevitability. Additionally, cards like Spreading Seas and Tectonic Edge provide additional disruption by mana denial."

The deck also includes powerful finishers like Grave Titan and Sarkhan the Mad. By controlling the board and drawing cards with Sign in Blood, the deck aims to maintain control of the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its threats. Additionally, the deck runs a few land destruction spells and lands that can turn into creatures to provide additional value."
