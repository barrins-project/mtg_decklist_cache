The deck also focuses on controlling the board with removal spells like Lightning Bolt, while also generating value with cards like Avenger of Zendikar and Oracle of Mul Daya. The inclusion of cards like Cultivate and Explore helps accelerate your mana base, giving you the resources needed to overpower your opponent with powerful creatures and efficient removal spells."
