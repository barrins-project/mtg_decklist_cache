By utilizing cards like Goblin Lackey and Aether Vial to cheat out powerful goblin creatures, the deck is able to quickly build a board presence and deal significant amounts of damage. Cards like Goblin Chieftain, Goblin Piledriver, and Goblin Warchief make the goblin creatures stronger and more resilient, while cards like Gempalm Incinerator and Siege-Gang Commander provide additional removal and reach. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Warren Weirding and Relic of Progenitus to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
