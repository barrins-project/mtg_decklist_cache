Pernicious Deed and Maelstrom Pulse provide board control while cards like Standstill and Force of Will help maintain the advantage. The deck aims to control the board, disrupt the opponent's strategy, and eventually gain a dominant position to win the game. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements while also providing utility with cards like Mishra's Factory and Wasteland."
