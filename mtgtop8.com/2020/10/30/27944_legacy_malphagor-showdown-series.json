Additionally, it includes potent threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to close out the game. The deck aims to grind out opponents with incremental advantage and efficient answers, ultimately overpowering them in the late game."

The deck can quickly ramp up to play powerful finishers like Craterhoof Behemoth or tutor them with Green Sun's Zenith and Natural Order. By efficiently chaining together creatures and spells, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a swarm of elves and close out the game in a single explosive turn."

The deck includes various creatures with enter-the-battlefield effects that can be abused with Aluren, such as Shardless Agent and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. By establishing a board presence quickly and efficiently, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful combo before they can react. The inclusion of disruptive cards like Force of Will and Abrupt Decay helps to protect and further enable the combo strategy."

The deck aims to cheat out powerful creatures like Griselbrand, Vilis, Broker of Blood, Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite, and Sire of Insanity early in the game, overwhelming the opponent with their sheer power and abilities. The deck also includes disruptive spells like Force of Will and Daze to protect its combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
