The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with early game pressure and combat tricks, while maintaining a consistent stream of threats. The deck aims to win the game by dealing damage directly to the opponent, utilizing the evasion of creatures like Vault Skirge and Silhana Ledgewalker to bypass blockers. This Mono Green Aggro deck is designed to end the game swiftly through efficient creature-based beatdown."
