The deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent's life total and hand size, utilizing powerful creatures like Rankle and Ox of Agonas to gain card advantage and close out games quickly. With a mix of efficient threats and disruption, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a strong board presence."
