It aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent's life total and finish the game as quickly as possible. The key strategy is to efficiently use cheap creatures with strong abilities, such as Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, and Embercleave, to maximize damage output and secure victories within a few turns. The deck also includes versatile spells like Shock and Shatterskull Smashing to remove threats or deal direct damage when needed. The objective is to maintain a fast pace and outpace the opponent to secure the win."
