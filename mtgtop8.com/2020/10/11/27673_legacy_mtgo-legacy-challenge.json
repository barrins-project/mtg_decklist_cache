The mana base is focused on consistency with fetch lands and dual lands to ensure the deck can reliably cast its spells.

This enables you to play powerful creatures like Bloodghast, Gravecrawler, and Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis. You can then use Altar of Dementia to mill more creatures into your graveyard and trigger abilities like Vengevine and Bridge from Below. Cabal Therapy helps disrupt your opponent's strategy while also filling up your graveyard. The deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with a fast, creature-heavy combo strategy."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan through cards like Force of Will and Assassin's Trophy, while generating card advantage with cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Sylvan Library. The deck also includes a mix of threats like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Entreat the Angels to close out the game once the opponent's resources are depleted. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure smooth gameplay."
