            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and consistent damage. Using a mix of cheap, efficient burn spells and creatures with haste, the deck aims to keep up the pressure from the very beginning of the game. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds extra resiliency and the ability to recur valuable threats from the graveyard. By utilizing a low mana curve and a high level of aggression, this deck seeks to close out games quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
