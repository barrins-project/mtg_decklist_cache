The deck aims to generate value through cards like Lucky Clover and Edgewall Innkeeper, and has access to versatile options through Fae of Wishes. The inclusion of Escape to the Wilds and Ondu Inversion provides additional card advantage and board control options. Overall, the deck focuses on accelerating mana production and controlling the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
