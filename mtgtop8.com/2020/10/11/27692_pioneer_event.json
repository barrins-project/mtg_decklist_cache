It also includes control elements like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Blast Zone to deal with opposing threats. The deck aims to control the game through its powerful creatures and board wipes, eventually winning by overwhelming the opponent with its high-powered threats. The key strategy is to efficiently ramp up mana and control the board until late game where the deck can take over with its powerful finishers."
