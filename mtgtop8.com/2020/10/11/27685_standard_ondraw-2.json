It takes advantage of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion to provide additional value and recursion. The deck aims to survive the early game with efficient removal spells like Bloodchief's Thirst and Drown in the Loch, while maximizing card advantage with Frantic Inventory and Into the Story. By using its efficient removal and counterspells, the deck aims to out-value and outlast the opponent to secure victory."
