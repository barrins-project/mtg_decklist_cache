Additionally, cards like Chalice of the Void and Thorn of Amethyst help disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Karn, Scion of Urza provide additional utility and card advantage. The deck's mana base is optimized for fast mana generation, allowing for explosive starts and consistent pressure."

It aims to control the board with removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Plague Engineer, while also having threats like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to pressure the opponent. The deck also utilizes powerful cards like Sylvan Library and Leovold, Emissary of Trest to gain card advantage and outvalue the opponent. Overall, the strategy is to combine aggression and midrange elements to overpower the opponent."
