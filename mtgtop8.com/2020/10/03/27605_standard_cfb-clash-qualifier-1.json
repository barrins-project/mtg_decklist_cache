By using counterspells like Mystical Dispute, removal like Bloodchief's Thirst, and powerful mill cards like Maddening Cacophony and Teferi's Tutelage, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and win condition. The deck also includes creatures like Ruin Crab and Thieves' Guild Enforcer to mill the opponent's library while drawing cards to fuel the mill strategy. Overall, this deck seeks to outlast the opponent and win through milling out their deck."
