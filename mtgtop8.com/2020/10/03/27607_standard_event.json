By casting spells like Cultivate and Genesis Ultimatum, the goal is to quickly accelerate into powerful plays. Felidar Retreat provides extra value by creating tokens and giving additional landfall triggers. Escape to the Wilds offers card advantage and Kenrith, the Returned King gives flexibility with its abilities. By efficiently managing resources and overwhelming the opponent with powerful spells, this deck aims to establish dominance and secure victory."
