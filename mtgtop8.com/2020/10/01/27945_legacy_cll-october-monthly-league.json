It relies on cheap, fast spells like Chain Lightning, Lava Spike, and Lightning Bolt combined with aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear to put pressure on the opponent. Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish the opponent for casting spells, while Price of Progress deals heavy damage if the opponent is playing nonbasic lands. The goal is to burn through the opponent's life total as quickly as possible and win the game before they can stabilize."

By dredging cards such as Golgari Grave-Troll, Golgari Thug, and Stinkweed Imp, it allows for the deck to quickly fill the graveyard with creatures. This activates cards like Bridge from Below, Narcomoeba, and Prized Amalgam to generate tokens and reanimate creatures. The deck also utilizes cards like Balustrade Spy and Dread Return to quickly put creatures from the library into the graveyard, further fueling the graveyard-based engine. This combination of effects allows for explosive and overwhelming plays."
