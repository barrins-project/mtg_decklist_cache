The deck aims to set up a fast win condition by using cards like Pyretic Ritual and Desperate Ritual to cast a high impact spell like Irencrag Feat or Reforge the Soul, leading to a combo finish with Goblin Charbelcher or a massive Valakut Awakening. The deck also includes cards like Bala Ged Recovery and Turntimber Symbiosis for card advantage and recursion."
