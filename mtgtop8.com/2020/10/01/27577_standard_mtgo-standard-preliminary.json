Fae of Wishes allows for versatile sideboard options and Escape to the Wilds provides additional card advantage. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistency in casting spells. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures and spells."
