The mana denial strategy with Wasteland and cheap removal spells like Lightning Bolt makes it difficult for opponents to stabilize, allowing the deck to maintain its aggressive edge throughout the game."

The deck aims to control the board state and keep the opponent from developing their strategy. It utilizes cards such as Force of Will, Swords to Plowshares, and Teferi, Time Raveler for disruption, while also using powerful spells like Lay Claim and Replenish to take over the game in the late stages. The deck also has options to draw cards, manipulate the top of the library, and clear the board when necessary."
