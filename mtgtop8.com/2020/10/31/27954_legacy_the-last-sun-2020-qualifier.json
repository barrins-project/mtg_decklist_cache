The deck is able to efficiently answer threats while also presenting its own threats in the form of versatile creatures like Ice-Fang Coatl and powerful finishers like Omnath, Locus of Creation. Additionally, the deck utilizes a mana base that includes various dual lands and basics for consistency and flexibility."
