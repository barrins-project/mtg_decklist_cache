            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly building a board presence and overwhelming the opponent with aggressive creatures. It utilizes Winota, Joiner of Forces to cheat out high-impact creatures like Archon of Emeria and Basri's Lieutenant. Using cards like Alseid of Life's Bounty and Selfless Savior to protect its key creatures, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The deck also has some flexibility with removal spells like Spikefield Hazard and Shatterskull Smashing to deal with opposing threats. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent land drops."
