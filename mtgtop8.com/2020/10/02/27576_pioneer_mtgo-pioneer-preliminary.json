The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain a steady stream of threats with cards like Bloodsoaked Champion and Scrapheap Scrounger. The inclusion of removal spells like Fatal Push and Murderous Rider helps control the board while cards like Knight of the Ebon Legion and Spawn of Mayhem provide additional ways to push damage and close out the game. The use of Mutavault and Castle Locthwain helps to provide additional utility and card advantage."
