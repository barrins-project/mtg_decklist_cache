The inclusion of powerful threats like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Bonecrusher Giant also allows the deck to pressure the opponent while maintaining control of the game. By disrupting the opponent's game plan and creating advantageous board states, the deck aims to secure victory through attrition and strategic play."
