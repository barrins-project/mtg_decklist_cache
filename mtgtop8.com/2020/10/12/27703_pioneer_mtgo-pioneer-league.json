The deck focuses on using cards like Lightning Strike, Boros Charm, and Viashino Pyromancer to deal damage directly to the opponent while maintaining a board presence with creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value by allowing cards to be recast from the graveyard. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast and efficient damage output."
