It also includes disruptive cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to outpace opponents and maintain card advantage through cards like Stitcher's Supplier and Village Rites, while also using Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion to provide additional value by recurring key creatures and spells from the graveyard."
