The deck also utilizes powerful threats like Questing Beast and Skyclave Apparition to control the board and push for damage. Additionally, the deck includes some resilience with cards like Scavenging Ooze and Elspeth Conquers Death to handle opposing threats. The mana base is designed for consistency and allows for both aggressive starts and powerful late-game plays with Emeria's Call and The Great Henge."

The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value by recurring cheap permanents from the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent while disrupting their game plan, ultimately securing victory through a combination of combat damage and milling."
