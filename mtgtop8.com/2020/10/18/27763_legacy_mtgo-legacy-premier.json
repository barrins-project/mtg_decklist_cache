The deck also aims to control the board with removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and disrupt the opponent's mana base with cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port. The deck utilizes Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play and efficiently use its resources. The inclusion of equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte provides additional win conditions and boosts the deck's overall power level."
