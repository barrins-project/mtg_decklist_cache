The deck utilizes countermagic such as Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect its threats while disrupting the opponent's game plan. Card selection and manipulation are key with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain helping to find the right cards at the right time. With a mix of burn spells like Lightning Bolt and efficient creatures, this deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain tempo throughout the game."
