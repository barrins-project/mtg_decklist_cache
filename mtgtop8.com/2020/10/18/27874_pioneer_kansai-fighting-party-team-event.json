It combines mana acceleration from creatures like Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves with aggressive threats like Goblin Rabblemaster and Legion Warboss, aiming to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a wide board presence. Cards like Angrath's Marauders and Burning-Tree Emissary provide additional synergy and power to the deck's strategy, allowing for explosive turns and unexpected victories."
