The deck utilizes a mix of card advantage engines like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Sylvan Library, along with a diverse mana base to ensure consistency and flexibility in responding to the opponent's threats. With a focus on resource management and disruption, this UWx Control deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in the Legacy format."
