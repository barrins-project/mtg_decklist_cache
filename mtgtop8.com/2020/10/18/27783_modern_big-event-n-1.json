The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while ramping up to powerful threats like Primeval Titan and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. The inclusion of cards like Wilderness Reclamation and Field of the Dead allows for additional value generation and inevitability in the late game. With a mix of disruption, ramp, and powerful win conditions, this deck looks to out value and outlast its opponents in a grindy game."
