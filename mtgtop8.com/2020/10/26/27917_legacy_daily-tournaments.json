By rushing out these big threats early on, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to react. The deck also includes protection spells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to ensure the combo goes off successfully, as well as card selection cards like Brainstorm and Ponder to find the combo pieces faster."
