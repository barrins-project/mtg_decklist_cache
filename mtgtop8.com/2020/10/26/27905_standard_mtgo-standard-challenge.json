By constantly cycling through cards, the deck aims to maintain a quick pace and pressure the opponent without running out of resources. The companion card, Lurrus of the Dream-Den, synergizes well with the cycling strategy, allowing for additional value to be gained from cycling cards. Overall, the deck is designed to overwhelm the opponent with fast-paced, aggressive plays."
