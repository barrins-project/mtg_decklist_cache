The key strategy is to use cards like Lightning Skelemental and Omnath to apply pressure while also disrupting your opponent's game plan with cards like Voice of Resurgence and Unsettled Mariner. The Elemental tribal theme allows for synergy between creatures and helps to protect your key pieces. Additionally, the inclusion of Aether Vial provides efficient creature deployment and manipulation. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents through a mix of control and Elemental synergy."

The deck also includes disruption cards like Drown in the Loch and Fatal Push to control the board and stop your opponent from easily stopping your mill strategy. Additionally, cards like Surgical Extraction can be used to remove key cards from your opponent's graveyard."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on controlling the game by using counterspells, card draw, and removal spells to disrupt the opponent's strategy. It also includes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to provide additional control and card advantage. The deck aims to stall the game until it can stabilize and take over with win conditions like Entreat the Angels or Time Warp. The mana base is designed to support the control strategy with a mix of lands that provide colored mana and utility, ensuring consistency in casting spells and protecting the player's life total."
