The combination of auras such as Karametra's Blessing, All That Glitters, and Ethereal Armor, along with cards like Sram, Senior Edificer and Season of Growth, allows the deck to quickly scale up its creatures and deliver lethal damage in a short amount of time. Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a powerful companion that can be used to recur auras and creatures from the graveyard, providing additional value and resilience to the deck."
