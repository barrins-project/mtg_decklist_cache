The use of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for recurring key creatures from the graveyard, ensuring a steady stream of threats. The deck includes cards like Deathrite Shaman and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also utilizing cards like Into the Story and Soaring Thought-Thief to draw cards and close out games quickly. The combination of aggressive creatures and disruption spells creates a versatile and resilient deck strategy."
