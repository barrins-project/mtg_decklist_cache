By ramping up quickly with mana dorks and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx, the deck aims to play big threats like Ghalta, Primal Hunger and Steel Leaf Champion early on. Cards like Garruk's Harbinger and Vivien, Arkbow Ranger provide additional card advantage and support for the creatures. The inclusion of combat tricks like Titanic Brawl and Aspect of Hydra helps the deck maintain pressure and win favorable trades in combat."
