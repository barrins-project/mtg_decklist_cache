Then, by casting Hogaak and utilizing Altar of Dementia, players can create a loop to mill themselves and continuously bring back creatures from the graveyard, triggering Bridge from Below multiple times and overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of creatures. The deck aims to win the game by generating a strong board presence through graveyard manipulation and combo interactions."

The deck utilizes various cards like Elvish Reclaimer, Crop Rotation, and Vampire Hexmage to search for and protect the combo pieces. It also includes disruptive cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to control the opponent's hand and Pithing Needle to shut down potential threats. Overall, the strategy focuses on speed and efficiency to win the game through the powerful Dark Depths combo."
