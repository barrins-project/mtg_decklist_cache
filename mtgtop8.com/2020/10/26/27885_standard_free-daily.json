By combining cards like Agadeem's Awakening and Malakir Rebirth with powerful creatures like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Rankle, Master of Pranks, the deck aims to continuously apply pressure and drain the opponent's life total quickly. Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional recursion options, while cards like Ayara, First of Locthwain and Acquisitions Expert help maintain a strong board presence."
