By utilizing cards like Felidar Retreat and Lotus Cobra to generate tokens and mana, the deck aims to create a wide board presence and apply pressure early on in the game. Yasharn, Implacable Earth helps to prevent the opponent from gaining life or sacrificing permanents, allowing the deck to maintain its aggression. Glass Casket and Skyclave Apparition provide removal and disruption to control the board while building up to a strong late-game with cards like Turntimber Symbiosis and Emeria's Call."
