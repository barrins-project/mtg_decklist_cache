By using cards like Storm's Wrath, Fire Prophecy, and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, the deck aims to keep opponents at bay while generating value through cards like Mazemind Tome and Solemn Simulacrum. The deck also utilizes creatures like Bonecrusher Giant and Ox of Agonas to apply pressure and close out games. With a focus on maintaining board control and resource advantage, this Mono Red Control deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents."
