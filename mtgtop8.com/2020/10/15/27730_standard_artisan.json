Focus on maximizing card draw and graveyard interaction with cards like Into the Story and Soaring Thought-Thief, while using cheap removal spells like Bloodchief's Thirst and Drown in the Loch to maintain board control. The deck's strategy centers around exploiting the opponent's weaknesses and capitalizing on the synergy between creatures and spells to secure victory through aggressive and strategic gameplay."
