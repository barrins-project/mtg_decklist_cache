The deck utilizes a variety of card draw, mana acceleration, and graveyard manipulation to quickly assemble the necessary pieces to win the game. By milling yourself and triggering powerful graveyard abilities, you can ultimately reanimate powerful creatures like Vengevine and quickly overwhelm your opponent. The key is to stay a step ahead of your opponent and efficiently execute your game plan before they can disrupt you."

It uses control elements such as Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to disrupt the opponent's game plan while ramping into powerful threats like Emrakul, the Promised End and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The deck also includes utility lands like Blast Zone and Sanctum of Ugin to further enhance its control and threat capabilities."
