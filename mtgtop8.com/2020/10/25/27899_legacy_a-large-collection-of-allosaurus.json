Emrakul, the Aeons Torn adds a strong finisher to the deck. The inclusion of cards like Show and Tell and Force of Will allows for a versatile gameplay, while cards like Brainstorm and Ponder help maintain card advantage and consistency. The deck also includes some removal spells like Fatal Push and Eliminate to deal with threats. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and disruptive plays."
