The deck also includes cards like Scorching Dragonfire and Primal Might for removal and additional reach. The Great Henge provides additional value and card draw, while Fabled Passage and Cragcrown Pathway help ensure consistent mana fixing. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, aggressive, and efficient in dealing damage."
