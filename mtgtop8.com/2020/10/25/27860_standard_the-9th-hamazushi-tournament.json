The key idea is to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats and efficiently use resources to maintain pressure and secure victory. The synergy between creatures and spells, along with the ramp provided by Gilded Goose and Castle Garenbrig, allows for explosive turns and constant pressure on the opponent. Vivien, Monsters' Advocate provides additional card advantage and helps to further support the aggressive game plan."
