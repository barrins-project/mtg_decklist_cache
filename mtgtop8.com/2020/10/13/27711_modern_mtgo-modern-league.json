            "notes": "The deck focuses on creating infinite combos by using cards like Saheeli Rai and Felidar Guardian. By repeatedly copying Felidar Guardian with Saheeli Rai's -2 ability, players can create an infinite loop of entering the battlefield triggers, allowing them to either flicker their own permanents for value or attack for lethal damage. The deck also includes cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Wrenn and Six to control the board and generate card advantage. Overall, the key strategy is to assemble the combo pieces quickly and efficiently to overwhelm opponents."
