The deck utilizes cards like Balustrade Spy, Undercity Informer, and Thassa's Oracle to mill through the deck and potentially win the game. It also includes cards like Pact of Negation and Force of Will to protect the combo and disrupt opponents. The deck also includes card draw spells like Ponder and Brainstorm to dig through the library and find key pieces."
