Supporting cards like Mishra's Bauble, Thoughtseize, Lightning Bolt, and Fatal Push help control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for recurring smaller creatures and spells, adding resilience to the deck. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy while also providing access to multiple colors for versatility."

The deck also includes various control elements, such as counterspells like Remand and Condescend, and card draw with Thirst for Knowledge and Gifts Ungiven.
