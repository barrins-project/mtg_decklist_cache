The deck also has a mill sub-theme with cards like Into the Story and Thieves' Guild Enforcer. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent with card advantage from cards like Shark Typhoon and Zareth San, while also having a decently low curve for aggression."

Zareth San, the Trickster and Gadwick, the Wizened provide additional value and card advantage. The deck also has some versatility with Shark Typhoon and Agadeem's Awakening for late-game power and recursion. The mana base is designed to support a smooth curve and consistent color requirements."
