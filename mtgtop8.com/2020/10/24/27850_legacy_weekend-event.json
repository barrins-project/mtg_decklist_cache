By casting a series of free spells and rituals, the deck can easily generate a critical mass of mana to cast Thassa's Oracle as the last remaining card in the deck, securing a victory. The deck also includes protection in the form of Force of Will and Pact of Negation to ensure the combo goes off successfully."
