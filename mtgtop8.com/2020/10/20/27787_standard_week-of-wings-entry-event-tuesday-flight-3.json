The deck also utilizes disruptive spells like Murderous Rider and Agonizing Remorse to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With cards like Rankle, Master of Pranks and Ox of Agonas providing additional value and card advantage, the deck aims to rapidly deplete the opponent's resources and close out the game quickly. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive game plan while still allowing for flexibility in casting spells."
