By utilizing counterspells and removal to protect its creatures, the deck aims to establish early board presence and maintain pressure throughout the game. The combination of aggressive creatures like Thieves' Guild Enforcer and Nighthawk Scavenger with card advantage engines like Soaring Thought-Thief and Merfolk Windrobber allows the deck to consistently apply pressure while disrupting the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the inclusion of powerful finishers like Rankle, Master of Pranks and Zareth San, the Trickster provides additional ways to close out games efficiently."
