The deck aims to lock the opponent out of casting their spells efficiently and quickly close out the game with powerful creatures and burn spells like Punishing Fire and Fiery Confluence. It utilizes fast mana acceleration and disruptive elements to win the game through a combination of resource denial and proactive threats."

The deck also utilizes disruption in the form of Chalice of the Void and Thought-Knot Seer to disrupt opponents' game plans. Karn, the Great Creator can also provide additional disruption and utility with his abilities. Overall, the main goal of the deck is to quickly overwhelm opponents with large Eldrazi creatures and disrupt their strategies with various tools to secure victory."
