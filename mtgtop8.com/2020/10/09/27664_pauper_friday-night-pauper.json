The deck focuses on protecting its creatures with protection spells and buffing them with auras like Cartouche of Solidarity and Ethereal Armor, while also utilizing cheap combat tricks like Mutagenic Growth and Defiant Strike to push through damage and maintain board presence. With a strong focus on early aggression and resilience, this deck aims to close out games quickly and decisively."
