The deck focuses on creatures like Bonecrusher Giant, Magmatic Channeler, and Mire Triton to apply early pressure and deal damage, while also utilizing powerful removal spells like Murderous Rider, Heartless Act, and Spikefield Hazard to control the opponent's creatures. The deck also includes graveyard interaction, with cards like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Tymaret Calls the Dead, to further disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck's land base ensures a consistent flow of mana to support its aggressive plays."
