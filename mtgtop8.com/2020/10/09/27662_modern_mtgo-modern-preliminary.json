The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast and efficient threats, while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Dismember and All Is Dust. By efficiently ramping into Eldrazi creatures using Eldrazi Temple and the Urza lands, the deck can quickly establish a dominant board presence and close out games before opponents are able to stabilize."
