            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to utilize ramp and control elements to disrupt and slow down the opponent while generating value from cards like Utopia Sprawl, Pillage, and Karn, the Great Creator. Karn can also shut down opponent's artifacts while providing additional threats. The deck also includes reach and removal with cards like Lightning Bolt, Bonecrusher Giant, and Glorybringer. Additionally, the deck has a minor graveyard interaction theme with Klothys, God of Destiny and Scavenging Ooze. The inclusion of Blood Moon can also disrupt opponent's mana base and give the deck an advantage."
