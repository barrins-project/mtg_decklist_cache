By manipulating the library with cards like Shelldock Isle and Jace, Wielder of Mysteries, the deck aims to quickly exile the library before winning the game with Oracle's ability. The deck also utilizes graveyard hate and hand disruption to ensure a clear path to victory. This combo-centric strategy requires careful decision-making and timing to successfully execute the win condition."
