The deck aims to control the board with cards like Delver of Secrets, Dreadhorde Arcanist, and Hooting Mandrills, while offering protection with Force of Will and Daze. Additionally, the deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns to further disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base includes fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistency and flexibility in casting spells."

By using cards like Life from the Loam, Crop Rotation, and Exploration, the deck can repeatedly access powerful lands like Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage to generate threats or disrupt the opponent's lands. With a combination of removal like Lightning Bolt and Punishing Fire, along with utility lands like Bojuka Bog and Rishadan Port, the deck aims to control the game and outvalue the opponent through land-based interactions."
