By using creatures like Spawn of Mayhem, Rankle, Master of Pranks, and Knight of the Ebon Legion, along with removal spells like Murderous Rider and Fatal Push, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain it throughout the game. Thoughtseize helps disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Scrapheap Scrounger and Bloodsoaked Champion provide recursive threats that can be difficult for the opponent to deal with. With a fast and aggressive strategy, this deck looks to win games quickly and decisively."
