Mishra's Bauble allows for card selection and graveyard synergies, while Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional card advantage by allowing players to continually replay small creatures. Thoughtseize disrupts opponents' game plans and clears the way for aggressive plays. This deck focuses on fast, decisive plays to overpower opponents before they can stabilize."
