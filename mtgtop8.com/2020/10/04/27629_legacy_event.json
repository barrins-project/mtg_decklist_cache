By utilizing cards like Ingenious Infiltrator and Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow, alongside other low-cost creatures like Ornithopter and Changeling Outcast, this deck aims to consistently apply pressure to the opponent. The inclusion of disruption spells like Force of Will and Fatal Push, as well as card draw and manipulation cards like Brainstorm and Daze, help maintain the deck's tempo and provide flexibility in various situations."
