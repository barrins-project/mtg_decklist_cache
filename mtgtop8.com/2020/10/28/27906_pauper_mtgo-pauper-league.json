By utilizing artifacts like Ardent Recruit, Atog, Frogmite, and Myr Enforcer along with spells like Thoughtcast and Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays while maintaining card advantage. The inclusion of cards like Fling allows for burst damage to finish off opponents. The mana base consists of artifact lands to support the Affinity strategy and ensure smooth mana production for a consistent aggressive game plan."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering key spells and removing threats while generating card advantage through spells like Mulldrifter and Forbidden Alchemy. With a mix of efficient creatures like Gurmag Angler and card selection from Preordain, the deck looks to stabilize the board and grind out a win through attrition. The Dimir Control archetype seeks to control the game tempo and outlast opponents with a versatile array of control tools."
