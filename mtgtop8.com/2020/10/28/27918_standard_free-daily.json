By utilizing creatures that have strong abilities or enter the battlefield effects, combined with cards like Village Rites and Malakir Rebirth to maintain card advantage, this deck aims to apply pressure from the early game onwards. With an emphasis on efficient mana costs and synergy between cards such as Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Nightmare Shepherd, this Mono Black Aggro deck looks to quickly deplete the opponent's life total and secure victory."
