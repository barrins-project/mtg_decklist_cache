By utilizing a combination of disruptive spells like Force of Will and Thoughtseize, along with tempo plays like Stifle and Daze, the deck aims to protect its aggressive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Tarmogoyf. The inclusion of Oko, Thief of Crowns provides additional versatility and power, while cards like True-Name Nemesis and Brazen Borrower offer additional threats that can quickly close out the game. The mana base is optimized to support all the different color requirements of the deck."
