            "notes": "The main focus of this Dimir Aggro deck is to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy while also aggressively attacking with evasive creatures. By utilizing a mix of removal spells, counter magic, and powerful creatures like Zareth San, the Trickster and Soaring Thought-Thief, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and close out the game quickly. The inclusion of card draw in the form of Into the Story helps maintain card advantage, while the mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility in casting spells."
