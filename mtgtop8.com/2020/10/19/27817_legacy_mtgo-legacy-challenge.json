The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Kitesail Freebooter and Mother of Runes, while steadily building up a strong board presence with cards like Champion of the Parish and Thalia's Lieutenant. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, while cards like Wasteland and Karakas provide additional disruption and protection for key creatures. The deck focuses on applying early pressure and controlling the game with efficient creatures and disruption."
