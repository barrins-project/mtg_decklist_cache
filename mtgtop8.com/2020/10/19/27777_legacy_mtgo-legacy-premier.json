With key cards like Craterhoof Behemoth and Natural Order, the deck can finish off the opponent in one explosive turn. The mana base is designed to support this strategy by including cards like Gaea's Cradle and Dryad Arbor."

The deck also utilizes cards like Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith to draw through the deck and find key combo pieces. Natural Order is used to tutor for Craterhoof Behemoth or other threats, while Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger provide additional value and protection for the creatures. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large board presence and win the game in a single turn."
