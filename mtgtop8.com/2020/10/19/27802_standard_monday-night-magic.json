The deck aims to stabilize the board with cards like Extinction Event and Heartless Act, counter key spells with Negate and Neutralize, and generate card advantage with Mazemind Tome and Frantic Inventory. The win condition is to outvalue the opponent with powerful threats like Ashiok, Nightmare Muse and Voracious Greatshark, while also having access to powerful finishers like Shark Typhoon. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistency in casting spells."

Embercleave provides a powerful late-game finisher, allowing the deck to close out games quickly before opponents can stabilize. The deck thrives on maintaining pressure and forcing opponents to react defensively."
