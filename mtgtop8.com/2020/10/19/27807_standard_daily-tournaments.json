Utilizing a combination of counterspells, removal spells, hand disruption, and powerful planeswalkers like Ashiok, Nightmare Muse, the deck aims to outlast and outvalue your opponent. The inclusion of cards like Mazemind Tome and Shark Typhoon further helps in card draw and producing threats. The deck also has a few finisher creatures like Voracious Greatshark and Lochmere Serpent to close out the game once you have established control."
