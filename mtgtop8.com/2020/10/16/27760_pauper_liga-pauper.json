The deck also includes ways to protect its creatures and gain additional resources through cards like Palace Sentinels and Golden Egg. By combining fast aggression with card advantage and protection, this deck aims to keep the pressure on opponents and secure a quick victory."

By combining control elements with card draw, the deck works towards creating a winning board state through careful management of resources and timing of spells."
