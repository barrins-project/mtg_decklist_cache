The deck includes counterspells like Force of Will and Daze to protect its threats, as well as disruption like Fatal Push and Baleful Strix to control the board. The deck's key strategy is to consistently apply pressure, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and generate card advantage through Yuriko's abilities."
