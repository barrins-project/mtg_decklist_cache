The deck takes advantage of the Zenith Flare card to deal damage directly to the opponent based on the number of cards cycled. By constantly cycling through the deck, the player can maintain a steady flow of resources and keep up the pressure on the opponent, ultimately aiming to win the game through sheer speed and efficiency."
