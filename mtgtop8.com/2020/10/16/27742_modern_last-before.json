By using cards like Thoughtseize and Dismember to manipulate your own life total, you can quickly drop Death's Shadow onto the field as a massive threat. The deck also includes aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage, along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Dart to help finish off your opponent. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with early aggression and efficient removal."
