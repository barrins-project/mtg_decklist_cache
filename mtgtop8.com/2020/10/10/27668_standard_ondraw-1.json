            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and efficient removal spells in order to quickly reduce their life total to zero. By combining powerful creatures like Bonecrusher Giant and Rankle, Master of Pranks with removal spells like Bloodchief's Thirst and Heartless Act, the deck aims to maintain board control while applying pressure. Additionally, the deck utilizes graveyard recursion with cards like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Tymaret Calls the Dead to continuously provide threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
