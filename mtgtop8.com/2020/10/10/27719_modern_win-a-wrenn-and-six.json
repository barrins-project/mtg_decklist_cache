Using cards like Through the Breach and Summoner's Pact, the deck can bring out powerful creatures early and start dealing massive amounts of damage with Valakut triggers. The inclusion of Castle Garenbrig and Field of the Dead provide additional ways to ramp up mana and generate tokens to overwhelm opponents. The deck aims to win through a combination of ramp, creature threats, and Valakut triggers to deal lethal damage."
