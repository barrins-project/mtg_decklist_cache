By disrupting the opponent's hand with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, while simultaneously developing a board presence with cards like Dreadhorde Arcanist and Young Pyromancer, the deck aims to apply constant pressure. Unearth and Seasoned Pyromancer provide additional card advantage and graveyard recursion, while Lightning Skelemental and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger deliver heavy hitting threats. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to clear a path for its creatures to attack relentlessly."
