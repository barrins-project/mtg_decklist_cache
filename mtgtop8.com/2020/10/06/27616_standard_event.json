It utilizes a mix of disruption spells and evasive creatures to control the board and chip away at the opponent's life total. By efficiently using removal spells like Heartless Act and countering their opponent's spells with Lofty Denial, they can clear the path for their evasive threats like Brazen Borrower and Nighthawk Scavenger to deal damage and close out the game quickly. It also includes card advantage tools like Into the Story and Merfolk Windrobber to keep the gas flowing throughout the game."
