The deck also includes counterspells like Drown in the Loch and Anticognition to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Lochmere Serpent can be used as a win condition, while planeswalkers like Jace and Ashiok provide additional card advantage and disruption. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and win through attrition."

By combining evasive threats like Nimana Skydancer and Soaring Thought-Thief with counter spells like Drown in the Loch and Didn't Say Please, the deck aims to control the game while dealing consistent damage. Into the Story and Frantic Inventory provide card draw to maintain momentum. Thieves' Guild Enforcer, Zareth San, the Trickster, and Zulaport Duelist offer additional ways to disrupt the opponent's game plan and secure victory."

Additionally, it uses cards like Teferi's Tutelage to mill the opponent's deck faster and eventually win through decking out. The mana base supports the three-color Grixis control archetype, with a mix of lands that provide the necessary colors and some life-gain lands for survivability."
