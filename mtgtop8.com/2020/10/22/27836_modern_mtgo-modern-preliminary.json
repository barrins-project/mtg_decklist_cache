By combining cards like Cathartic Reunion, Life from the Loam, and Stinkweed Imp, players can trigger powerful effects like Creeping Chill and Ox of Agonas. The deck aims to establish a strong board presence and overwhelm opponents with a combination of aggressive creatures and direct damage spells. The key strategy is to efficiently fill the graveyard with key cards and then quickly bring them back into play for a powerful offensive."
