It also aims to generate card advantage through drawing with Soaring Thought-Thief and filtering with Overwhelmed Apprentice. The deck's win condition lies in milling the opponent's deck with Ominous Seas and Teferi's Tutelage or bringing back key creatures with Call of the Death-Dweller for a final blow."
