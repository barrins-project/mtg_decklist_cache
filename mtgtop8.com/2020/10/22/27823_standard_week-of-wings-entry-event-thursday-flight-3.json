Additionally, it utilizes Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion to bring back low-cost creatures and enchantments from the graveyard, providing additional value and resilience to the deck.

            "notes": "This deck focuses on controlling the game through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw. The main win condition is utilizing Transmogrify to turn tokens generated by Omen of the Sun or Shark Typhoon into Dream Trawler, a powerful threat that can quickly close out the game. Yorion, Sky Nomad serves as a companion to provide additional value by flickering permanents for extra card advantage. The deck aims to stall the game and grind out an advantageous board state before overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats like Dream Trawler."
