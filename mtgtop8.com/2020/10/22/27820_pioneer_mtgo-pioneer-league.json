Cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Goblin Rabblemaster can help increase the number of non-human creatures to trigger Winota's ability multiple times in a turn. Angrath's Marauders can double the damage dealt, delivering a lethal blow to the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful board state and close out the game quickly."
