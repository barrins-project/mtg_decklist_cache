By curving out with strong threats like Questing Beast and Polukranos, Unchained, the deck can quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. With a mix of efficient removal and resilient threats, this deck is designed to be a consistent and formidable force in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
