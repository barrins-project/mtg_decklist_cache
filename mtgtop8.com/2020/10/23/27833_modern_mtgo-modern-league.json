Cards like Noble Hierarch and Vines of Vastwood help protect your infect creatures, while Blossoming Defense and Apostle's Blessing provide additional protection and evasion. Inkmoth Nexus serves as an alternate win condition, allowing you to turn it into a creature and activate its infect ability for a surprise victory."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while ramping into powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. Chalice of the Void is used to lock down specific mana costs, creating a difficult board state for the opponent to navigate."

By utilizing lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to boost the power and toughness of all Merfolk creatures, along with disruptive cards like Merfolk Trickster and Unsettled Mariner, the deck can quickly establish board control and pressure the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Force of Negation and Path to Exile provide answers to opponent threats, while Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment. Spreading Seas can disrupt opponent's mana base, giving the deck additional advantage."

The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with Utopia Sprawl and Arbor Elf, while also applying pressure with creatures like Bloodbraid Elf and Elder Gargaroth. Klothys, God of Destiny helps to provide additional value and resilience. Overall, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also presenting a strong board presence to close out the game."
