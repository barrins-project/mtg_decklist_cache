The deck also utilizes powerful equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte to buff up creatures and control the board. Land destruction through cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port further cripples opponents, creating a strong tempo advantage for the player."

It also has a strong control element with counterspells like Force of Will and disruptive cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns. The mana base includes fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistent color access. The deck aims to pressure opponents quickly while disrupting their game plan, ultimately leading to victory through a combination of creature damage and control elements."
