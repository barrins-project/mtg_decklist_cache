By combining cheap instants like Lightning Bolt and Gut Shot with aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Sprite Dragon, the deck aims to control the board and pressure the opponent early in the game. Cards like Light Up the Stage and Stormwing Entity provide card advantage and additional threats, while efficient mana-fixing with cards like Manamorphose allows for consistent aggression. With a focus on speed and resource management, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
