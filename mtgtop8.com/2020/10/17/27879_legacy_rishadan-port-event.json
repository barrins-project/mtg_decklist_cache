The deck leverages cards like Brainstorm, Force of Will, and Swords to Plowshares to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also generating card advantage through cards like Sylvan Library and Ponder. The inclusion of cards like Veil of Summer and Dead of Winter provide additional protection and removal options, making it difficult for the opponent to establish a board presence. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent to secure victory."
