By assembling key combo pieces like Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek, as well as utilizing efficient removal spells like Fatal Push, it aims to disrupt opponents while generating value with cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer and Emry, Lurker of the Loch. The deck utilizes tutor effects like Whir of Invention to find necessary pieces and can also generate card advantage with Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath."
