The deck also focuses on ramping up mana with Llanowar Visionary and Khalni Ambush to play powerful threats like Voracious Typhon and Syr Faren, the Hengehammer. The inclusion of cards like Bala Ged Recovery and Garruk's Uprising provide additional utility and card advantage to help maintain pressure on the opponent."
