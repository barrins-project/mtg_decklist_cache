The deck relies on the synergy between cards like Champion of the Parish, Thalia's Lieutenant, and General Kudro of Drannith to build a strong board presence quickly. Cards like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter also help to disrupt the opponent's game plan while cards like Aether Vial and Cavern of Souls provide mana fixing and acceleration. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy."

The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value and resilience in the late game. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push, while pushing damage through with cards like Temur Battle Rage and Mutagenic Growth. The mana base is designed to support the deck's low curve and enable consistent access to all colors of mana."
