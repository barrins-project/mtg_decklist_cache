In addition, the inclusion of cards like Veil of Summer and Ice-Fang Coatl helps to protect against disruption and control strategies.

With a focus on efficient mana fixing and card draw, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategies while building up its own resources. By leveraging powerful cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns, Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and Force of Will, the deck can maintain control of the battlefield and dictate the pace of the game. Additionally, the inclusion of snow lands and cards like Ice-Fang Coatl and Dead of Winter provide additional value and versatility in various matchups."
