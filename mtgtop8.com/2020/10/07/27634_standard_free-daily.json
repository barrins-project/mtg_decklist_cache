By combining aggressive threats like Nighthawk Scavenger and Thieves' Guild Enforcer with disruptive cards like Brazen Borrower and Drown in the Loch, the deck aims to control the game while dealing consistent damage to the opponent. The Dimir color combination allows for a versatile range of spells that can handle various threats and keep the pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to win the game through a combination of early aggression and disruption."
