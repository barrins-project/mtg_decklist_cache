Cards like Faithless Looting and Battle Screech provide card advantage and additional threats, allowing the deck to maintain pressure and close out the game quickly. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive game plan with a mix of red and white sources."

By playing multiple Slivers, the deck can overwhelm opponents with a high powered and synergistic creature army. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to refill the hand with even more Slivers. The mana base is designed to provide the necessary colors for the Slivers while maintaining consistency. The goal is to apply pressure early and push for a quick victory through aggressive creature combat."

Cards like Crypt Rats and Pestilence help to clear the board when necessary. The deck also has some card draw and recursion to help maintain card advantage and recover from losses. Overall, the goal is to outlast the opponent and win the game through attrition and control."
