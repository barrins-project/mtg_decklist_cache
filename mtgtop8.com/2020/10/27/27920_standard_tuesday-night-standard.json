By combining these threats with removal spells like Bloodchief's Thirst and Shatterskull Smashing, the deck aims to control the board while dealing damage quickly. Additionally, the deck utilizes graveyard recursion with cards like Ox of Agonas and Tymaret Calls the Dead to maintain card advantage and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Finally, the inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Liliana, Waker of the Dead adds another layer of threat and versatility to the deck."
