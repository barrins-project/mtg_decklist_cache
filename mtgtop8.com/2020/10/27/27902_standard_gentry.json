Key cards like Rankle, Master of Pranks, Savvy Hunter, and Village Rites help generate card advantage and maintain tempo, while cards like Witch's Oven and Lampad of Death's Vigil enable efficient creature sacrifice. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creature aggression and disruptive tactics."
