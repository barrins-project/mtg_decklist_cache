The goal is to control the board through various removal spells like Glass Casket and Extinction Event, while generating card advantage with cards like Trail of Crumbs and Elspeth Conquers Death. The deck also uses Eerie Ultimatum to bring back multiple permanents from the graveyard for a powerful late-game play. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and control the game until it can secure a victory."
