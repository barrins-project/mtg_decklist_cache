The deck also includes a variety of card draw and countermagic spells to control the board and disrupt opponents' strategies. Overall, the key idea is to ramp up quickly with the Urza lands, control the game with card advantage and removal, and eventually overwhelm opponents with powerful spells and card advantage."

Seeker of the Way provides lifegain to help stabilize against other aggressive decks, while Squadron Hawk helps ensure a steady stream of creatures to attack with. Prismatic Strands offers protection against opposing removal spells, and Rally the Peasants can provide a powerful finisher. The mana base supports the aggro strategy by focusing on producing red and white mana for quick plays."
