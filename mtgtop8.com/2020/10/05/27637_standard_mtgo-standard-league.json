The goal is to control the game by disrupting the opponent's strategy while steadily decreasing their library size. Thieves' Guild Enforcer and Ruin Crab help to further accelerate the milling process, while Sea Gate Stormcaller provides extra value by copying key spells. Overall, the deck aims to win through deck depletion rather than traditional damage output."
