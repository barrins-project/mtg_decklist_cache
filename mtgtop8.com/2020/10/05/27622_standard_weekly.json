Felidar Retreat can create multiple creature tokens to pressure the opponent, and Escape to the Wilds allows the player to draw additional cards and keep the pressure going. The land base ensures consistent mana production across all colors."

The deck also uses the enchantment Doom Foretold to force opponents to make difficult decisions and keep their resources in check.
