With the ability to create a wide board presence and deal massive damage with Winota triggers, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its combo potential. Additional cards like Kenrith, the Returned King and Seasoned Hallowblade provide extra utility and protection, making this deck a formidable force in the Pioneer 1 vs 1 format."

It includes cards that help the player dig through their deck quickly to find the necessary pieces to execute their game plan, such as Sylvan Scrying and Dig Through Time. By combining untap effects like Hidden Strings and Vizier of Tumbling Sands with Lotus Field, the deck aims to generate a large amount of mana and cast spells like Peer into the Abyss to win the game in one explosive turn."
