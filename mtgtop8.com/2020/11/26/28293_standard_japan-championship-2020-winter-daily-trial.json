The deck focuses on using cards like Bonecrusher Giant, Brazen Borrower, and Terror of the Peaks to remove threats and maintain board control. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Kazandu Mammoth and Lovestruck Beast allows for a strong offense while cards like Cultivate and Genesis Ultimatum help to ramp up mana and play big threats quickly. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of control and powerful creatures."
