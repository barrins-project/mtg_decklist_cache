The inclusion of cards like Embercleave and The Great Henge provide additional power and resilience to the deck. The deck also includes removal spells like Fire Prophecy and Primal Might to deal with opposing threats. With a focus on aggressiveness and tempo, this Gruul Aggro deck aims to close out games quickly and decisively."
