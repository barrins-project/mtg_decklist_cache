The deck also includes disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push to control the board and keep the opponent on the back foot. Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord provides additional value and synergy with vampire creatures. The deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total while maintaining card advantage and board presence to secure victory in a fast-paced Pioneer 1 vs 1 match."
