Yorion, Sky Nomad allows for extra value by flickering creatures and gaining card advantage. The deck also includes powerful additions such as The Great Henge and Emeria's Call for additional threats and resilience. With a mix of aggressive creatures and versatile removal spells, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory through a combination of aggression and control."
