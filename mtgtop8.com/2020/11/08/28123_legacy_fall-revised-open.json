            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to quickly fill up the graveyard with creatures like Hogaak, Bloodghast, Gravecrawler, and Vengevine using cards like Hedron Crab, Stitcher's Supplier, and Careful Study. Once the graveyard is filled, the deck aims to combo off by sacrificing creatures to Altar of Dementia and generate tokens with Bridge from Below. This allows the player to overwhelm their opponent with a large army of creatures and quickly close out the game. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
