Gadwick, Zareth San, and Brazen Borrower provide card advantage and tempo advantage, while Thieves' Guild Enforcer and Soaring Thought-Thief attack the opponent's hand and graveyard. Removal spells like Heartless Act and Eliminate help maintain board control, while card draw spells like Into the Story and Drown in the Loch keep the deck's gas flowing. The deck also has a disruptive element with counterspells and a bit of graveyard hate."
