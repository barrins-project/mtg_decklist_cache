            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly fill up your graveyard with creatures and then use cards like Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis, Bloodghast, and Vengevine to bring them back onto the battlefield for aggressive combo plays. With cards like Stitcher's Supplier, Gravecrawler, and Altar of Dementia helping to facilitate this strategy, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a powerful board presence. Cabal Therapy and Careful Study provide additional graveyard manipulation and disruption, while Bridge from Below can generate tokens to further pressure opponents. The mana base focuses on fetching lands that produce both black and green mana for consistency."
