It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while ramping up resources and card advantage through cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Growth Spiral. With access to powerful cards like Omnath, Locus of Creation and Time Warp, the deck can quickly take control of the game and shift momentum in its favor. The mana base is optimized for consistency and includes powerful utility lands like Mystic Sanctuary to further increase the deck's control potential."
