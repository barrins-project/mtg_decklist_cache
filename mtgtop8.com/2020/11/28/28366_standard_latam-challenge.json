By utilizing strong creatures like Brushfire Elemental, Bonecrusher Giant, and Kazandu Mammoth, along with powerful spells like Soul Sear and Embercleave, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain a steady stream of threats. The inclusion of cards like Edgewall Innkeeper and Vivien, Monsters' Advocate helps generate card advantage and keep the pressure on the opponent. The deck's goal is to close out the game swiftly before the opponent can stabilize."
