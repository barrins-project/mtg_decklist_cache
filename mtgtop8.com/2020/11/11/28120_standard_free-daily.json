The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive creatures and burn spells, utilizing the synergy between red creatures and artifacts to secure victory. The focus is on constantly applying pressure and forcing the opponent to react defensively, ultimately leading to a win through sheer aggression."
