By utilizing powerful planeswalkers like Teferi and Jace, along with permission spells like Cryptic Command and Spell Snare, the deck aims to disrupt its opponent's game plan while generating incremental advantage. The inclusion of cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Force of Negation further solidifies the control aspect of the deck. Additionally, the deck includes utility lands like Mystic Sanctuary and Field of Ruin to further enhance its control capabilities."
