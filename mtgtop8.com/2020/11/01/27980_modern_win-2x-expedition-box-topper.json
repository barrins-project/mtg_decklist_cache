            "notes": "This UR Aggro deck focuses on fast-paced, efficient damage dealing using cheap spells and creatures with prowess abilities. The goal is to quickly empty your hand of aggressive threats like Monastery Swiftspear, Sprite Dragon, and Stormwing Entity, while utilizing burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Dart, and Gut Shot to clear the way and finish off opponents. The deck aims to be hyper-aggressive and overwhelm opponents before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of card draw spells like Serum Visions and Light Up the Stage helps maintain momentum and find the right cards to keep up the pressure."
