The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while building towards a win condition through milling with cards like Ruin Crab and Soaring Thought-Thief, and closing out the game with a large Agadeem's Awakening or a powerful creature reanimated with Call of the Death-Dweller."

The deck focuses on dealing damage efficiently and maintaining card advantage through a combination of card draw and graveyard recursion. With a streamlined game plan and a focus on early aggression, this Mono Black Aggro deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
