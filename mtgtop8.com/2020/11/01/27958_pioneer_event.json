By utilizing cards like Sram, Senior Edificer and Season of Growth to draw more cards, the player can consistently find and play auras to buff their creatures. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for recursion of auras from the graveyard. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast, large creature that is difficult to deal with due to the protection granted by auras and other cards in the deck."
