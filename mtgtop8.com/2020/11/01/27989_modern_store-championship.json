The goal is to put pressure on the opponent early and keep them on the back foot with cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Boros Charm. The mana base is optimized for consistency and speed with fetch lands and shock lands to ensure the deck can cast its spells on curve. The aggressive nature of the deck seeks to end the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
