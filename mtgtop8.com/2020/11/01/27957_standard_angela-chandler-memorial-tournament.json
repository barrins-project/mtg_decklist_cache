By efficiently ramping with cards like Lotus Cobra and Tangled Florahedron, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a constant stream of threats. Cards like Scavenging Ooze and Skyclave Apparition provide removal and disruption to slow down opposing strategies. The key strategy is to build a wide board presence and utilize cards like Felidar Retreat and Emeria's Call to go wide and go tall at the same time."
