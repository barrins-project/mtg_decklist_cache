By cycling through cards and building up resources, the deck aims to create a powerful Zenith Flare finisher to close out the game. Additionally, the inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds consistency to the deck by allowing for the recursion of key cycling cards. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast-paced aggressive strategy fueled by cycling synergies."
