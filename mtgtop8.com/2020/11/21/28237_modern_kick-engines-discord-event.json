The goal is to utilize Primeval Titan to search for lands like Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Field of the Dead to generate massive amounts of value. With the ability to play multiple lands per turn and untap lands with Amulet of Vigor, this deck can overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures and generate a huge board presence in just a few turns."
