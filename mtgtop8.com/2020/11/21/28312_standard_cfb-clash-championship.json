With a mix of counter spells like Negate and Essence Scatter, along with removal spells like Heartless Act and Bloodchief's Thirst, this deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent. The addition of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value and flexibility in the deck."
