By using cards like Leyline of Sanctity for protection and Pelakka Predation for disruption, the deck aims to quickly assemble key pieces like Vengevine and Sword of the Meek to overwhelm opponents with powerful plays. With a focus on efficient mana generation and graveyard recursion, the deck aims to quickly set up game-winning combos while controlling the game with disruptive spells and creatures."
