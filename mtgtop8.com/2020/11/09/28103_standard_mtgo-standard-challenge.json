By utilizing cards like Into the Story, Drown in the Loch, and Lullmage's Domination, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and win conditions. Thieves' Guild Enforcer and Ruin Crab provide additional mill support, while Lurrus of the Dream-Den acts as a versatile companion that can bring back key cards from the graveyard. With a focus on control and mill, this deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent."
