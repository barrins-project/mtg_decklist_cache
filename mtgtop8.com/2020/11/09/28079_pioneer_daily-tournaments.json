The deck focuses on sacrificing its own creatures, such as Blisterpod, Satyr Wayfinder, and Priest of Forgotten Gods, to trigger effects like Zulaport Cutthroat and Cruel Celebrant, which drain the opponent's life. This deck also utilizes Fiend Artisan as a versatile threat that can grow in power and search for key creatures. Additionally, the deck has the potential for explosive plays with Rally the Ancestors and Return to the Ranks to bring back multiple creatures at once."
