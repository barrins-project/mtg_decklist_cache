It also includes powerful cards like Embercleave and Shatterskull Smashing to deal extra damage and clear the way for attacks. The goal is to build a strong board presence early in the game and maintain pressure on the opponent to finish them off before they can stabilize. With a focus on fast, efficient creatures and direct damage spells, this deck aims to win quickly and decisively."
