Additionally, the deck includes disruption in the form of hand disruption spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, as well as removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember to control the board. The deck also includes ways to recur key threats with cards like Traverse the Ulvenwald and Lurrus of the Dream-Den."

            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to control the game through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and card advantage. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating incremental advantages with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. By utilizing a variety of versatile and flexible cards like Cryptic Command, Archmage's Charm, and Force of Negation, the deck can adapt to different situations and effectively answer threats from the opponent. The mana base is carefully constructed to support these powerful spells and ensure consistency in casting them."
