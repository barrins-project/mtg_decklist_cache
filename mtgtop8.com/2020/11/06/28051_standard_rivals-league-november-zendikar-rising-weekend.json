This is achieved by utilizing cards like Essence Scatter, Eliminate, Cling to Dust, Heartless Act, Lullmage's Domination, and Bloodchief's Thirst to remove threats and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also focuses on resource management with cards like Drown in the Loch and Into the Story to gain card advantage. Additionally, the deck has a mill sub-theme with Ruin Crab and Soaring Thought-Thief, putting additional pressure on the opponent and potentially emptying their library."
