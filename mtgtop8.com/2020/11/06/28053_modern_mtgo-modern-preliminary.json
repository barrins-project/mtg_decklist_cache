By using cards like Death's Shadow and Scourge of the Skyclaves to take advantage of your own life loss, combined with discard spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's strategy, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and finish the game before they can stabilize. Additionally, utilizing cards like Lightning Bolt and Temur Battle Rage for additional damage output and removal, this deck is designed to secure victories through speed and aggression."
