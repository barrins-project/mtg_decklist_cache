It also aims to generate card advantage through card draw effects and token production. By playing a defensive game plan and out-valuing the opponent, the deck aims to win through incremental advantage and eventually overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Dream Trawler and Shark Typhoon. The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value and flexibility in the deck's strategy."
