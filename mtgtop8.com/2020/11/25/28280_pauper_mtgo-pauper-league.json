By having multiple low-cost creatures that generate mana and provide additional benefits such as life gain, card draw, and pump effects, the deck aims to build a wide board presence quickly. Cards like Lead the Stampede and Distant Melody allow the player to refill their hand with more Elves, while cards like Timberwatch Elf and Wildheart Invoker provide the necessary finishers to secure victory. The deck combines mana ramp, card advantage, and combat tricks to maximize damage output and pressure the opponent."
