This allows the player to cast powerful colorless threats like Emrakul, Ulamog, and Wurmcoil Engine. The deck also includes versatile artifacts like Karn Liberated and Karn, the Great Creator to control the board and search for key pieces. Additionally, there are disruption elements like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus to disrupt opponents' strategies. The overall strategy is to control the game with powerful threats and versatile spells until victory is achieved."
