By leveraging the power of Yorion as a companion, the deck can consistently blink its own permanents for additional value. The deck's win condition usually involves generating card advantage through recurring threats with Dance of the Manse and Elspeth Conquers Death, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with Doom Foretold and Extinction Event. It aims to control the board state and grind out a victory with incremental advantage."
