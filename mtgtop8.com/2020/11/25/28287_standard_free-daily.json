The deck also utilizes powerful cards like Sublime Epiphany and Kiora Bests the Sea God to gain additional advantage. Gadwick and Brazen Borrower provide additional control options, while cards like Mystic Sanctuary and Castle Vantress help to ensure consistency in drawing key cards. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outtempo the opponent through a combination of counterspells, card draw, and efficient threats."
