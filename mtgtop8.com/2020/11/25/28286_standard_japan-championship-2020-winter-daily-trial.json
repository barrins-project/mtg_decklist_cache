The key strategy is to establish a strong board presence early with fast plays like Lovestruck Beast, Seasoned Hallowblade, and Bonecrusher Giant, backed up by removal and protection from cards like Giant Killer and Outlaw's Merriment. The deck aims to close out games with Embercleave and The Great Henge, leveraging the card advantage from Edgewall Innkeeper to maintain a steady stream of threats. Vivien, Monsters' Advocate provides additional card advantage and mana ramp to overwhelm the opponent."
