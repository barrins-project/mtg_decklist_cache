The key strategy is to efficiently control the board and opponent's resources through a combination of removal spells and counterspells, ultimately overwhelming them with card advantage and graveyard recursion. With a focus on disruption and manipulation, the deck seeks to outlast the opponent by grinding out incremental advantages and denying them the ability to execute their own game plan effectively."
