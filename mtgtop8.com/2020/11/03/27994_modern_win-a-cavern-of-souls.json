This allows the player to quickly ramp into powerful threats like Primeval Titan and Dryad of the Ilysian Grove, ultimately leading to overwhelming board presence and potential for a combo finish with cards like Turntimber Symbiosis and Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle. The deck aims to take advantage of land interactions to outvalue and outpace the opponent."
