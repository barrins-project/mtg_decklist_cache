Ugin, the Spirit Dragon serves as a win condition and a way to clear the opponent's threats. Ox of Agonas can be used as a card draw engine and a way to replenish the hand. The deck also includes some life gain lands like Radiant Fountain to help stabilize against aggressive strategies. Overall, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and win through incremental advantage."
