This combo is supported by cards like Ranger-Captain of Eos to tutor for key pieces, and Collected Company to help assemble the combo quickly. The presence of Auriok Champion provides protection and lifegain, while Giver of Runes offers valuable protection. The deck also runs disruption in the form of Skyclave Apparition to deal with opponent's threats. Overall, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful synergy."
