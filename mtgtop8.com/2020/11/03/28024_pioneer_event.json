The main strategy is to create a fast and aggressive board presence to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their game plan. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds an extra layer of consistency and value to the deck. By combining efficient creatures with powerful auras and protective measures, this deck aims to win the game through combat damage in a swift and decisive manner."
