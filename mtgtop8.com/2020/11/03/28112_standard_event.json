The deck also includes powerful support cards like The Great Henge and Elspeth Conquers Death to provide additional value and control the board. Yorion, Sky Nomad is included as a companion to provide additional value and synergy with the deck's flicker effects. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of fast creatures and powerful synergies."
