By efficiently using efficient spells like Lightning Bolt and Light Up the Stage, as well as pump spells like Mutagenic Growth and Bedlam Reveler, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a variety of threats such as Sprite Dragon, Stormwing Entity, and Monastery Swiftspear. The mana base is built to support the aggressive game plan, with a focus on red mana sources and the ability to filter mana with cards like Manamorphose."
