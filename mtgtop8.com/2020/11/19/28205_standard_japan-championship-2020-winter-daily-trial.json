The addition of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion adds an extra source of damage. The deck aims to outvalue opponents with cards like Genesis Ultimatum and The Great Henge while maintaining a solid defensive position through cards like Brazen Borrower and Bonecrusher Giant. Overall, the deck seeks to dominate the late game with powerful creatures and spells."
