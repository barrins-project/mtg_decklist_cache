            "notes": "The main focus of this Legacy 1 vs 1 deck is to combo off with Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis as quickly as possible by filling up the graveyard with creature cards using cards like Stitcher's Supplier and Careful Study. Additionally, using Altar of Dementia to further fuel the graveyard and trigger Bridge from Below for extra value. The deck aims to bring back key creatures like Bloodghast and Vengevine to overwhelm the opponent and win the game. The mana base is designed to support the graveyard-centric strategy while also allowing for consistent casting of cards."
