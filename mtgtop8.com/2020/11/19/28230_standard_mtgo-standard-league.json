            "notes": "This deck focuses on overwhelming the opponent with fast and powerful creatures, using mana acceleration provided by Gilded Goose and Tangled Florahedron to quickly curve out threats like Feasting Troll King and Lovestruck Beast. Trail of Crumbs and Bonders' Enclave help with card advantage, while The Great Henge provides a big boost to your board presence. Kogla, the Titan Ape offers removal and protection, making it difficult for opponents to stabilize against your aggressive onslaught. Castle Garenbrig helps with ramping, ensuring you can keep up the pressure and overwhelm your opponent."
