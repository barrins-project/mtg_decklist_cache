Liliana, Waker of the Dead and Tymaret Calls the Dead provide additional value and graveyard recursion, giving the deck resilience and flexibility. The deck's land base supports its aggressive game plan with a mix of sources for both colors."

Once you reach the late game, you aim to dominate the board with powerful threats such as Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Genesis Ultimatum. The deck also includes powerful creatures like Terror of the Peaks and Beanstalk Giant to pressure your opponents. The mana base is carefully crafted to ensure you have the right colors to cast your spells consistently."
