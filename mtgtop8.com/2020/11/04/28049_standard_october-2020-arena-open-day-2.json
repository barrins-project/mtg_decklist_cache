The deck also has a self-milling strategy with cards like Woe Strider and Tymaret Calls the Dead, allowing for additional value and graveyard recursion. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and maintain control throughout the game."

The deck focuses on generating value through enter-the-battlefield effects with cards like Skyclave Apparition and Glass Casket to control the opponent's board. Yorion, Sky Nomad serves as both a finisher and a way to flicker creatures for additional value. The deck also includes some removal options like Wicked Wolf and Elspeth Conquers Death, while maintaining card advantage through Trail of Crumbs and Vivien, Monsters' Advocate. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a well-rounded mix of creatures and control elements."

The deck also includes alternative win conditions like milling the opponent with Glimpse of Freedom and Mystic Subdual. By stabilizing the board, generating card advantage, and having versatile answers for threats, the deck seeks to grind out a victory against most opponents."

The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a Companion allows for recursion of key creatures, maintaining pressure on opponents. The deck also includes removal options like Skyclave Apparition and offers some flexibility with cards like Charming Prince."
