The inclusion of bounce spells like Echoing Truth and Moonblade Shinobi adds even more disruption to the deck's game plan, allowing for more control over the battlefield and the opponent's strategy."

By utilizing cards like Thoughtcast and Prophetic Prism, the deck can draw through the deck quickly to find key pieces for aggressive plays. Fling and Galvanic Blast are used as finishers to close out games when the opponent's defenses are down. The mana base is primarily made up of artifact lands to ensure the deck can produce the necessary colors of mana to cast its creatures and spells efficiently."
