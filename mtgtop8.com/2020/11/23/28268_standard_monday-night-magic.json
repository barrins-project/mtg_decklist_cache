It also aims to generate card advantage and selection with cards like Mazemind Tome and Omen of the Sea. The deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Ashiok, Nightmare Muse and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to further control the board and generate value. The companion Yorion, Sky Nomad provides additional value by allowing for extra cards and resetting powerful permanents. The mana base is optimized for consistency and to support the control game plan."
