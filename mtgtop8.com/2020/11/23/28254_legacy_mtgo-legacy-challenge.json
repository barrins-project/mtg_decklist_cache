The deck also includes disruption cards like Thoughtseize and Force of Will to protect the combo, as well as card advantage engines like Brainstorm and Ponder to ensure consistency in drawing the necessary pieces.

It utilizes cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to slow down opponents, while using ramp cards like Noble Hierarch and Birds of Paradise to accelerate its own game plan. The deck also includes powerful threats like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Knight of the Reliquary to pressure opponents and close out games quickly. Additionally, the deck includes versatile removal spells like Swords to Plowshares to deal with opposing threats."
