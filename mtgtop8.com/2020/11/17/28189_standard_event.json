By utilizing powerful red creatures like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Bonecrusher Giant, along with equipment like Embercleave, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and close out the game swiftly. The inclusion of cards like Rimrock Knight and Fervent Champion helps maintain a constant stream of threats while also providing some additional utility. With a high number of Mountains and Castle Embereth for added damage, this deck is designed for fast-paced, aggressive gameplay."
