Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by allowing the player to continuously recur low-cost permanents from the graveyard. The inclusion of versatile cards like Cling to Dust and Sea Gate Restoration further enhances the deck's ability to control the game's pace."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Skyclave Apparition and Elspeth Conquers Death, while also generating card advantage and stabilizing with cards like Dream Trawler and Extinction Event. The win condition is to outvalue the opponent through efficient removal and card advantage until the opponent runs out of resources."
