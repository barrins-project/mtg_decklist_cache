This combo is supported by cards like Ranger-Captain of Eos, Giver of Runes, and Conclave Mentor to protect and enhance the combo's effectiveness. The deck also includes cards like Collected Company and Eladamri's Call to help find the combo pieces quickly. Additionally, Utopia Sprawl and Arbor Elf are used to ramp up mana production and ensure the combo can be effectively pulled off."
