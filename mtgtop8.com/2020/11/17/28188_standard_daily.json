With efficient removal like Bonecrusher Giant and Scorching Dragonfire, as well as card advantage from Castle Vantress and Genesis Ultimatum, this deck aims to outvalue and overwhelm opponents in the mid to late game. Shark Typhoon provides additional flexibility and win conditions, making the deck a versatile and resilient control archetype."
