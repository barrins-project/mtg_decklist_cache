It includes powerful creatures like Questing Beast and Brushfire Elemental, along with efficient removal spells like Bonecrusher Giant and Fire Prophecy. The goal is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a mix of creatures and direct damage, often finishing the game with Embercleave. The deck also includes some card draw and life gain to help maintain momentum. The mana base is built to support a quick and consistent curve, ensuring that the deck can apply pressure from the start."
