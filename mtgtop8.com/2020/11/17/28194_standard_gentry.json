The deck aims to establish early game presence with cards like Improbable Alliance and Sprite Dragon, while using countermagic like Lofty Denial to protect key spells. The deck also includes card draw engines like Frantic Inventory to ensure a steady flow of resources. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game tempo and out-valuing opponents in a 1 vs 1 scenario."
