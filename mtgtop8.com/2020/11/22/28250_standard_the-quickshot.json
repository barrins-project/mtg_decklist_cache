By utilizing powerful creatures like Questing Beast, Lovestruck Beast, and Brushfire Elemental, along with efficient removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire and Shatterskull Smashing, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and deal damage to the opponent as efficiently as possible. The inclusion of cards like Embercleave and Primal Might provide additional combat tricks and ways to pump up creatures for maximum damage output."
