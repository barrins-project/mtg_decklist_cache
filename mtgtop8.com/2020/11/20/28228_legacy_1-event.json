By consistently casting burn spells and attacking with creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the goal is to reduce the opponent's life total to zero as quickly as possible. The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Price of Progress also punishes opponents for playing nonbasic lands, adding another layer of pressure to the aggressive strategy."
