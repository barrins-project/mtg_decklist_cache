Karn, the Great Creator can shut down opponent's strategies by accessing the sideboard through artifacts, while cards like Chalice of the Void and Walking Ballista provide additional disruption and control. The deck aims to assemble its combo pieces quickly and efficiently to overwhelm opponents and secure a victory."
