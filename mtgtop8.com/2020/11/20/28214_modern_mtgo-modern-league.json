The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack further punishes opponents for playing non-creature spells, ensuring a quick victory through direct damage.

It also includes burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Dart to deal direct damage to the opponent or clear blockers. The inclusion of cards like Seasoned Pyromancer and Light Up the Stage helps to maintain card advantage. Blood Moon acts as disruption against multicolor decks, while the companion Obosh, the Preypiercer, boosts the damage output of all odd-converted mana cost spells in the deck. Overall, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with relentless aggression and burn damage."
