            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the board by utilizing cards like Narset, Teferi, and Agent of Treachery to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The key concept is to use the Fires of Invention enchantment to cast multiple spells for free each turn, while also taking advantage of Lukka and Transmogrify to cheat out powerful creatures like Agent of Treachery. The deck also includes ways to generate card advantage and create a board presence with cards like Omen of the Sea, Shark Typhoon, and The Birth of Meletis while using Yorion as a companion for additional value."
