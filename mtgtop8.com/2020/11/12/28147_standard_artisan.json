By utilizing cards like Mystical Dispute, Neutralize, and Jwari Disruption, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining card advantage through cards like Frantic Inventory and Opt. The win condition is provided by creatures like Sprite Dragon and Improbable Alliance, which can quickly close out the game if left unchecked. The deck focuses on being proactive while controlling the pace of the game."
