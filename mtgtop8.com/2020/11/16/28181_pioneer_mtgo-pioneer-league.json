It aims to stabilize the game with sweepers like Supreme Verdict and Elspeth Conquers Death, while generating card advantage with planeswalkers like Narset and Ashiok. The inclusion of Yorion as a companion provides additional value by blinking permanents for extra ETB triggers. The mana base is carefully crafted to ensure consistent access to all colors needed to cast your spells efficiently."
