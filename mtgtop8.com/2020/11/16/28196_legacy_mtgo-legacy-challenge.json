The deck also utilizes card draw through cards like Elvish Visionary and Glimpse of Nature to help find combo pieces quickly. The deck also has a toolbox aspect with Green Sun's Zenith to find specific creatures when needed. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large number of powerful creatures and finish the game quickly."
