It also includes cards like Stitcher's Supplier and Young Pyromancer to generate value from the graveyard. The deck also includes disruption with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push, and has access to reach and removal with cards like Claim / Fame and Village Rites. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and control the game with a mix of aggression and disruption."
