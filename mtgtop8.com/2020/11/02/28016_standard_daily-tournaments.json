This is achieved through cards like Negate, Essence Scatter, Drown in the Loch, and Cling to Dust. The deck also utilizes mill effects with cards like Soaring Thought-Thief and Thieves' Guild Enforcer to drain the opponent's deck and potentially win by decking them out. The deck's win condition is Shark Typhoon, which can create a massive flying creature or generate card advantage."
