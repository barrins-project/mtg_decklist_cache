This mana is then used to cast powerful late-game threats such as Wurmcoil Engine and Karn, the Great Creator to control the board and win the game. The deck also includes disruption in the form of counterspells like Condescend and Remand, along with versatile removal spells like Cyclonic Rift and Spatial Contortion, to control the game until the win condition can be established."
