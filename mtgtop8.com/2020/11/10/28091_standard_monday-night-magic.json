The key strategy is to establish a board presence with evasive threats like Nighthawk Scavenger and Soaring Thought-Thief, while protecting them with counterspells like Lofty Denial. Zareth San, the Trickster can then capitalize on the opponent's graveyard, using their own resources against them. The deck aims to close out the game quickly by pressuring the opponent and controlling the board."
