Using cards like Street Wraith, Mishra's Bauble, and Thoughtseize to draw cards, disrupt your opponent's strategy, and lower your life total, you aim to control the board with cheap removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember while protecting your threats with Stubborn Denial. With powerful threats like Gurmag Angler and Snapcaster Mage, you aim to deal massive damage quickly and overwhelm your opponent before they can stabilize."
