By efficiently ramping into your big threats and using cards like Escape to the Wilds and Genesis Ultimatum to generate card advantage, you can overwhelm your opponent's board while keeping them off balance with counterplay and removal options. This deck aims to control the game until you can win through a powerful tempo advantage and overwhelming board presence."

The companion Yorion, Sky Nomad provides additional value by allowing for extra blink effects on key permanents. Overall, the strategy revolves around stabilizing the board, disrupting the opponent's plans, and eventually overwhelming them with powerful threats."
