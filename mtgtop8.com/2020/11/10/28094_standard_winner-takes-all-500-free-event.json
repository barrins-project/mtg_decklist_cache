            "notes": "This deck focuses on efficiently utilizing mana ramp and powerful aggressive creatures to quickly overwhelm the opponent. By ramping up mana with cards like Gilded Goose and Tangled Florahedron, the deck can cast large threats such as Feasting Troll King and Kogla, the Titan Ape ahead of schedule. The Great Henge provides additional card draw and life gain to sustain the aggressive strategy. Cards like Witch's Oven and Trail of Crumbs provide additional value and utility to further pressure the opponent. With a focus on speed and power, this deck aims to win quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
