The goal is to quickly deplete the opponent's resources and finish them off with evasive threats like Brazen Borrower and Shark Typhoon. The deck aims to maintain pressure and control throughout the game."

Brazen Borrower can provide tempo advantage, while counter spells like Mystical Dispute and Essence Scatter disrupt the opponent's game plan. Removal spells like Heartless Act and Into the Story help maintain board control, while Drown in the Loch offers flexibility. Agadeem's Awakening can be used to reanimate key threats, and Shark Typhoon provides a late-game win condition."
