The key strategy is to establish a strong board presence early on, ramp into powerful creatures like Elder Gargaroth and Feasting Troll King, and use cards like The Great Henge and Trail of Crumbs to maintain card advantage. By efficiently utilizing your mana and constantly applying pressure, you can outpace your opponent and secure victory before they have a chance to stabilize."
