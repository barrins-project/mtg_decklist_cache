It aims to control the board with cards like Path to Exile and Aether Vial, while also leveraging equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine for additional threats. The mana base is built around land destruction with cards like Field of Ruin and Ghost Quarter, ensuring opponents have trouble developing their own game plan."
