The key strategy is to establish a strong board presence early on with creatures like Fervent Champion and Anax, Hardened in the Forge, while using burn spells like Shock and Bonecrusher Giant to control the board. The deck aims to close out games quickly with Embercleave, while also maintaining pressure with Phoenix of Ash and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell. The mana base consists of mostly Mountains to ensure consistent and fast deployment of threats."

With a mixture of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence while disrupting the opponent's strategy. The land base and support cards provide stability and consistency to ensure the deck can execute its game plan effectively."
