The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with cards like Gilded Goose and Tangled Florahedron to play powerful creatures such as Elder Gargaroth and Kogla, the Titan Ape. The inclusion of cards like The Great Henge and Bonders' Enclave provide card draw and additional advantages to maintain pressure on the opponent. This deck aims to establish early board presence and continue to apply pressure until victory is achieved."
