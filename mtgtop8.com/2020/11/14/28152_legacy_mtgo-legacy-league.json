It leverages cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Teferi, Time Raveler, and Narset, Parter of Veils to manipulate the game state and disrupt opponent's strategies. Additionally, it includes a mix of counterspells, cantrips, and removal spells to maintain control of the game. The deck aims to control the pace of the game, generate card advantage, and eventually win through incremental advantages and superior resource management."
