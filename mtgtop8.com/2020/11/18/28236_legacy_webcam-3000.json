Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Price of Progress punish opponents for playing noncreature spells or greedy mana bases, while Sulfuric Vortex provides a consistent source of damage. The deck aims to apply pressure early on and finish the opponent off with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike. It prioritizes speed and efficiency in dealing damage to win the game quickly."

This allows for a quick and explosive combo win condition using Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis and Vengevine. The deck also utilizes graveyard recursion with cards like Bloodghast, Gravecrawler, and Stitcher's Supplier to consistently fill up the graveyard and enable the combo. Additionally, the deck runs disruptive cards like Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
