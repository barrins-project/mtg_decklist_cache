The deck aims to pressure the opponent's life total quickly while maintaining card advantage through cards like Brainstorm and Ponder. The inclusion of Oko, Thief of Crowns provides additional disruption and threats to the board. The efficient mana base allows for consistency in casting spells while also enabling the deck to pivot between aggressive and controlling plays."

By utilizing cards like Exploration, Crop Rotation, and Life from the Loam, the deck aims to quickly assemble powerful land combinations like Dark Depths/Thespian's Stage and Valakut Exploration to pressure and outvalue opponents. Punishing Fire provides removal and life gain, while Rishadan Port and Wasteland disrupt opponent's mana base. The deck also includes utility lands like Glacial Chasm and Karakas for defense and disruption. The goal is to control the game through land interactions and grind out advantage over time."
