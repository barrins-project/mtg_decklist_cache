Gadwick, Zareth San, and Brazen Borrower serve as versatile threats that can provide card advantage and disruption, while Thieves' Guild Enforcer and Soaring Thought-Thief apply pressure to the opponent. With a focus on tempo and disruption, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents and secure victories through relentless aggression and control."
