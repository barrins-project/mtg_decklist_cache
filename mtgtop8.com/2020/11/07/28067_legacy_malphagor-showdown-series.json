Cards like Hogaak, Vengevine, Bloodghast, and Gravecrawler can all be easily brought back from the graveyard to overwhelm the opponent. Altar of Dementia is used to sacrifice creatures for additional graveyard value, while cards like Stitcher's Supplier and Faithless Looting help to fill the graveyard even faster. Cabal Therapy is used for disruption, while Carrion Feeder can be used as a sacrifice outlet. This deck thrives on graveyard synergy and explosive plays."
