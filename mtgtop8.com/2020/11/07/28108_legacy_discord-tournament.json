            "notes": "The deck focuses on maintaining control over the game by using counterspells and removal spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan. It also utilizes card advantage engines like Sylvan Library and Narset, Parter of Veils to draw into more answers and stay ahead in the resource war. The inclusion of powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Oko, Thief of Crowns allows the deck to apply pressure while still being able to interact with the opponent's board. The mana base is built to support the deck's color requirements and maximize efficiency with fetch lands and dual lands."
