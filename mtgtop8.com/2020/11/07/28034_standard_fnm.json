The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value by blinking permanents for even more advantage. The deck's win condition comes from landing powerful threats like Dream Trawler or Shark Typhoon, backed up by hard-to-deal-with cards like Elspeth Conquers Death and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through careful resource management."
