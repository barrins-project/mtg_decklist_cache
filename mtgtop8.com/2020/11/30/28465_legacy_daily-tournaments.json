The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large board presence and buffed creatures, often winning the game in one explosive turn. The mana base includes Gaea's Cradle to further accelerate the mana production."

It also includes cards like Omniscience and Cunning Wish to help control the game and protect its combo pieces. The deck's strong card selection and countermagic, such as Force of Will and Veil of Summer, ensure that the player can effectively set up their combo and protect it from opposing disruption. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Brainstorm and Ponder assists in finding key combo pieces quickly."
