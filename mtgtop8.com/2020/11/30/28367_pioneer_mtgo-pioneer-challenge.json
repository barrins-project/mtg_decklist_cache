It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures like Stonecoil Serpent and efficient auras like Cartouche of Solidarity and Ethereal Armor. Using cards like All That Glitters, Gryff's Boon, and Sentinel's Eyes, the deck can quickly buff up its creatures and push damage through to defeat the opponent. Additionally, it utilizes cards like Alseid of Life's Bounty and Karametra's Blessing for protection and resilience."
