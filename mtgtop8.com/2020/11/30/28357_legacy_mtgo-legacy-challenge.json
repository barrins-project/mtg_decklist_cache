By utilizing cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Urza, Lord High Artificer, the deck aims to generate mana quickly and control the game with cards like Chalice of the Void and Narset, Parter of Veils. Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Sai, Master Thopterist provide additional value by recurring artifacts and creating creature tokens. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of aggro pressure and disruptive plays."

Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Green Sun's Zenith and Once Upon a Time to efficiently search for key creatures like Knight of the Reliquary and Primeval Titan. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value and card advantage throughout the game. The land base is designed to both support the deck's aggressive strategy and provide utility with cards like Karakas and Maze of Ith."

The key goal is to build a critical mass of Elves on the battlefield, ramp into a large amount of mana with cards like Gaea's Cradle, and then finish the game with a powerful combo like casting Craterhoof Behemoth with Natural Order. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a massive board presence and quickly close out the game before they can effectively respond."
