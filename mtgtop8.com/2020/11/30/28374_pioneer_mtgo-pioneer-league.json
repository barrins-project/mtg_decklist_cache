The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion adds additional flexibility and value to the deck's gameplay."

By utilizing powerful auras like All That Glitters and Ethereal Armor, along with creatures like Favored Hoplite and Hateful Eidolon, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence. The addition of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds resilience and consistency to the deck, allowing for easy access to key cards. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure smooth gameplay and optimal color distribution."
