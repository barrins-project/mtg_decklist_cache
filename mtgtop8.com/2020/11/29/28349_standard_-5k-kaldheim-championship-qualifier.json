The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays, using cards like Feasting Troll King and Wicked Wolf to control the board while constantly putting pressure on the opponent. The Great Henge provides additional card draw and life gain, while Trail of Crumbs helps to dig for more creatures. Vivien, Monsters' Advocate can provide additional threats, and Crawling Barrens can become a win condition in the late game."
