The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage and setting up powerful late-game plays with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. It also utilizes efficient removal like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay to deal with threats on the board. By controlling the game and out-valuing the opponent, this deck looks to grind out victories in the long game."
