It utilizes cards like Mystical Dispute, Censor, and Anger of the Gods to disrupt the opponent's game plan while ramping and drawing cards with Growth Spiral, Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and Chemister's Insight. Wilderness Reclamation allows for explosive turns, while Expansion / Explosion can serve as a finisher. The deck aims to out-value and out-tempo the opponent through efficient control spells and powerful threats."

The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for some recursion of auras from the graveyard, ensuring a steady stream of threats throughout the game. The deck's speed and consistency make it a potent force in Pioneer 1 vs 1 matches."
