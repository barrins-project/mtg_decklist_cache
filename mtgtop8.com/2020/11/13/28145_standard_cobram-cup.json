Utilizing cards like Edgewall Innkeeper and Lovestruck Beast to draw cards and generate tokens, along with removal spells such as Heartless Act and Murderous Rider to deal with threats. The Great Henge provides a powerful way to gain advantage through its card draw and lifegain, while Agadeem's Awakening can help bring back key creatures from the graveyard. Vivien, Monsters' Advocate offers additional card advantage and utility."
