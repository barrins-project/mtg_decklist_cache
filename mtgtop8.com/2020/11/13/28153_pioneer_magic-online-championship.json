Other cards like Creeping Chill and Prized Amalgam provide additional value when milled, while cards like Sea Gate Restoration and Agadeem's Awakening offer potential card advantage. The key strategy is to quickly mill through the deck and bring back the Worldspine Wurm or Silversmote Ghoul to win the game in a single turn."

With a fast pace and relentless aggression, this deck aims to close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
