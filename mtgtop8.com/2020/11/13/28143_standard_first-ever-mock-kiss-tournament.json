By deploying threats like Questing Beast, Feasting Troll King, and Wicked Wolf early in the game, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total and control the board. The deck also utilizes ramp cards like Gilded Goose and Kazandu Mammoth to accelerate its game plan and potentially play high-impact cards like The Great Henge. Trail of Crumbs and Vivien, Monsters' Advocate provide card advantage and additional ways to create pressure on the opponent."
