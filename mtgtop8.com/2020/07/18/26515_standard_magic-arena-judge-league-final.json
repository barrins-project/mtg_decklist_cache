The win condition comes from generating value through Shark Typhoon and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, while also utilizing the flexible spell Expansion / Explosion for added control or finishing power. Nightpack Ambusher and Brazen Borrower provide additional tempo plays and pressure on opponents. The deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents in a longer, grindy game."
