The deck aims to quickly overwhelm opponents with its swarm of small but powerful creatures."

The deck also utilizes a toolbox of counterspells like Mystical Dispute, Aether Gust, and Negate to disrupt the opponent's game plan.

This is achieved by utilizing cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, Mystical Dispute, and Negate to counter and remove opponent's spells, while cards like Growth Spiral and Wilderness Reclamation help ramp up mana and generate card advantage. The deck also focuses on generating value through cards like Expansion / Explosion and Shark Typhoon, while maintaining a solid land base for flexibility and consistency."

By ramping up mana with cards like Growth Spiral and Cultivate, the deck can play high-impact cards like Hydroid Krasis and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. Removal spells like Eliminate and Agonizing Remorse help manage the board, while threats like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Casualties of War provide additional win conditions. The deck aims to out-value the opponent with strong, versatile cards and grind out a victory through attrition."
