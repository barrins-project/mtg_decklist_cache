It aims to take advantage of powerful late-game threats such as Uro and Shark Typhoon while using Teferi, Time Raveler to disrupt opponent's game plan. The deck utilizes a Temur color combination for versatility and consistency, with a mix of Triomes and shock lands for mana fixing. Overall, the strategy revolves around generating card advantage, controlling the board, and overwhelming the opponent with high impact spells and creatures."
