The deck aims to control the game tempo through card advantage and efficient use of mana, utilizing cards like Preordain and Brainstorm to filter through the deck and find the right answers. The combination of aggro creatures and control elements makes this deck a versatile and powerful choice in Pauper 1 vs 1 matches."

The inclusion of cards like Faithless Looting and Reckless Wurm also helps to maintain card advantage and provide additional threats. Overall, the strategy of this deck is to outpace the opponent and secure victory through relentless aggression."
