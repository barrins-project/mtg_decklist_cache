It aims to play a long game, using Uro to gain card advantage and tempo, backed up by powerful threats like Expansion / Explosion and Shark Typhoon. The deck is resilient against aggressive strategies due to its defensive tools, and can close out games with a large mana advantage thanks to Wilderness Reclamation. Overall, the key concept is to outvalue and outlast the opponent while maintaining control of the game."
