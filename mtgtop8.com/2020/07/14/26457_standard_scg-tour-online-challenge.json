By quickly developing a strong board presence with creatures like Pelt Collector, Questing Beast, and Stonecoil Serpent, and using cards like Ram Through and Gemrazer to eliminate threats, the deck aims to close out games swiftly before the opponent can stabilize. Cards like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Vivien, Arkbow Ranger provide additional utility and power to further solidify the deck's aggressive strategy."
