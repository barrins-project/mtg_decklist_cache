The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value by constantly bringing back low-cost creatures from the graveyard. The deck focuses on aggressive plays, utilizing cards like Boros Charm and Reckless Rage to clear the way for the creatures to deal damage efficiently. The mana base is optimized to support a fast-paced aggro strategy in a Pioneer 1 vs 1 format."
