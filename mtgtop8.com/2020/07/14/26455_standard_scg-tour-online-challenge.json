The key strategy is to use cards like Cauldron Familiar, Witch's Oven, and Mayhem Devil to create a loop of sacrificing creatures for damage and triggers. The addition of cards like Dreadhorde Butcher and Priest of Forgotten Gods adds additional pressure and value to the strategy. The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggression and resource denial through sacrifice effects."
