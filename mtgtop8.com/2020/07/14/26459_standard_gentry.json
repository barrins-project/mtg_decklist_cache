The deck includes powerful planeswalkers like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Liliana, Dreadhorde General to help maintain board presence and generate card advantage. Additionally, the deck utilizes Gate creatures like Gatebreaker Ram and Gate Colossus as win conditions. The overall strategy is to outvalue and outlast the opponent with a mixture of control and midrange threats."
