The inclusion of Gingerbrute and Pollywog Symbiote adds further versatility and consistency to the aggro strategy. To protect its creatures and ensure favorable combat situations, the deck includes Gods Willing and Fight as One. The mana base consists of lands that provide both colors, ensuring consistent casting of spells."
