Magus of the Moon and Pillage help disrupt the opponent's mana base, while Klothys, God of Destiny provides both incremental advantage and a win condition."

Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan while continuing to apply pressure. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive strategy by providing consistent access to the necessary colors of mana."

The deck focuses on control elements, using cards like Commandeer, Condescend, and Remand to disrupt the opponent's game plan. It also utilizes card draw and manipulation (Omen of the Sea, Shark Typhoon) to maintain card advantage. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion provides additional value and allows for a potent endgame strategy. Overall, the deck aims to control the game while assembling and exploiting the UrzaTron lands for dominance."
