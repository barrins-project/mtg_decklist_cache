Cards like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Runaway Steam-Kin provide additional value and ramp, while Embercleave serves as a powerful finisher. Castle Embereth boosts the power of all creatures, while Fervent Champion and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell enhance the damage output. By curving out and applying constant pressure, this deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
