The deck can create large shark tokens with Shark Typhoon and finish off opponents with Expansion / Explosion. Nightpack Ambusher provides a steady stream of wolf tokens for defense, while Brazen Borrower and Bonecrusher Giant offer additional versatility. The key strategy is to disrupt opponents while building towards a powerful end game."

By using cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Elspeth Conquers Death to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while generating value with cards like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, the deck aims to outlast its opponents and eventually win through incremental advantage. Shark Typhoon and Hydroid Krasis provide additional win conditions, while Aether Gust offers flexibility against a variety of threats."
