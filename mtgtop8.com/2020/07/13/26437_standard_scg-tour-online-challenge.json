            "notes": "This deck focuses on sacrificing creatures to trigger various effects, utilizing cards like Witch's Oven, Priest of Forgotten Gods, and Cauldron Familiar for value. By taking advantage of the synergy between sacrifice, recursion, and damage triggers, the deck aims to control the board while dealing consistent damage to the opponent. The inclusion of Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion provides additional value and flexibility to the deck's game plan. This aggressive Rakdos Aggro strategy aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of card advantage and efficient threats."

The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad allows for additional value by blinking permanents. The mana base is focused on providing consistent access to blue and white sources to support the control strategy."
