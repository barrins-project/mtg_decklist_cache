The deck also incorporates creatures with cheap mana costs, like Sprite Dragon and Pteramander, that can quickly grow in power with each instant and sorcery cast. Additionally, it includes Crackling Drake and Stormwing Entity, which benefit from the number of spells in the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient spells and creatures."
