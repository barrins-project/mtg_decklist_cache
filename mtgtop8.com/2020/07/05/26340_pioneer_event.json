By utilizing cards like Spell Queller, Supreme Phantom, and Empyrean Eagle, the deck aims to establish a strong flying and evasive threat. Additionally, cards like Rattlechains and Shacklegeist provide disruption and protection for your creatures. The deck also includes counterspells like Lofty Denial to control the game and Rally of Wings to finish off the opponent quickly. Overall, the strategy involves curving out efficiently and applying pressure from the early turns."
