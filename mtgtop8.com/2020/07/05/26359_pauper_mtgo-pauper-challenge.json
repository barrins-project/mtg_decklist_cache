The deck also utilizes cards like Prismatic Strands and Ephemerate to protect its creatures and disrupt the opponent's strategy. By drawing cards with Mulldrifter and filtering with Prophetic Prism, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and ultimately win through superior resource management and efficient use of its mana base."
