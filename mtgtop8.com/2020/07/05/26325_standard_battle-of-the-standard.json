By utilizing efficient low-cost creatures like Pelt Collector and Gingerbrute, along with pump spells like Giant Growth, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and deal damage to the opponent early on. Cards like Questing Beast and Gemrazer provide additional value and utility, while cards like Syr Faren, the Hengehammer and Lovestruck Beast offer strong synergies within the mono green aggro strategy. Overall, the deck aims to establish dominance on the battlefield and pressure the opponent into making unfavorable trades."
