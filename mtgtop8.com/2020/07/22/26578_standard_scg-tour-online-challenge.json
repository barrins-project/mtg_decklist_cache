By utilizing a high land count and cards like Omen of the Sea and Fabled Passage, the deck aims to consistently hit its land drops and generate card advantage. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by flickering permanents like Omen of the Sea and Castle Ardenvale. Overall, the deck seeks to outvalue and outlast opponents through attrition and control."
