            "notes": "The main focus of this Mono Black Aggro deck is to quickly apply pressure to the opponent through aggressive creatures and efficient removal spells. By utilizing a combination of early attackers like Bloodsoaked Champion and Dread Wanderer, along with powerful threats like Knight of the Ebon Legion and Spawn of Mayhem, the deck aims to close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Thoughtseize provides disruption while Fatal Push and Murderous Rider keep the opponent's board in check. Castle Locthwain offers card advantage and Mutavault adds versatility to the creature base."
