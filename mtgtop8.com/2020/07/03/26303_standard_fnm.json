Winota, Joiner of Forces provides additional value by cheating out more creatures onto the battlefield. Tajic, Legion's Edge and Seasoned Hallowblade offer protection and resilience against removal spells. The goal is to apply relentless pressure on the opponent, forcing them to react while maintaining a strong board presence. The deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
