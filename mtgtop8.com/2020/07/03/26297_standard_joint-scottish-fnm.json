It includes strong aggro cards like Questing Beast, Bonecrusher Giant, and Embercleave to deal quick and significant damage. The inclusion of Klothys, God of Destiny and Scavenging Ooze provides additional value and disruption against graveyard strategies. The deck also features removal spells like Lava Coil and Domri's Ambush to control the board. Overall, the deck's main goal is to apply constant pressure and win the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
