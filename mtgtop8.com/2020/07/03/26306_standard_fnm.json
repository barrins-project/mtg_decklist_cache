Supporting cards like Embercleave and Domri's Ambush help to deal additional damage and control the battlefield. The deck aims to curve out efficiently with early plays like Pelt Collector and Paradise Druid leading into bigger threats like Terror of the Peaks. The use of efficient mana sources like Temple of Abandon and Stomping Ground allow for a strong aggressive strategy that can overwhelm opponents quickly."
