Using cards like Claim the Firstborn and Witch's Oven to steal and sacrifice creatures, along with Mayhem Devil and Woe Strider to deal damage and generate additional value. Bolas's Citadel serves as a finisher, allowing you to play cards from the top of your library and potentially win the game in a single turn. This deck aims to outvalue and outlast your opponent through careful resource management and strategic plays."
