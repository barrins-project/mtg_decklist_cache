This mono-green aggro deck aims to bring out a strong board presence early on, leveraging cards like Questing Beast, Syr Faren, and Gemrazer to push through damage and close out games swiftly. With a mix of creature pump spells like Giant Growth and Titanic Growth, this deck is built to apply consistent pressure and maintain tempo throughout the game."
