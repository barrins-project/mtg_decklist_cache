By ramping up mana with Growth Spiral and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and counter their key spells with cards like Mystical Dispute and Negate. The deck also includes removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire and Flame Sweep to manage the opponent's board presence. Overall, the deck's goal is to establish control of the game and win through incremental advantage."
