By playing creatures like Pelt Collector, Questing Beast, and Gemrazer, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and apply pressure on the opponent. Cards such as Vivien, Arkbow Ranger and The Great Henge provide additional support and card advantage, while cards like Mobilized District and Castle Garenbrig help to ramp up mana and potentially play multiple threats in a single turn. Overall, the deck aims to win the game through fast, efficient aggression."
