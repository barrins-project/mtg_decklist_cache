The aim is to outvalue and outlast opponents through a combination of counterspells, card draw, and powerful threats like Shark Typhoon and Nightpack Ambusher. The deck aims to maintain board control and card advantage until it can close out the game with a large Explosion, or overwhelming opponent with a swarm of Shark tokens."
