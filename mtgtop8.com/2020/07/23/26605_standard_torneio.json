The deck aims to consistently generate value with powerful threats like Shark Typhoon and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. The inclusion of Nissa, Who Shakes the World provides additional ramp and threat potential. The deck also has flexible options with Expansion / Explosion and Commence the Endgame for closing out games. Overall, the deck focuses on resource management and out-valuing the opponent."
