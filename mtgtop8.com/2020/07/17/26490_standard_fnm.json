The deck also utilizes removal spells like Murderous Rider, Heartless Act, and Eliminate to control the board and clear the way for its creatures to attack. Demonic Embrace and Shadowspear provide additional ways to pump up creatures and push for more damage. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent through a combination of fast, efficient creatures and removal spells."
