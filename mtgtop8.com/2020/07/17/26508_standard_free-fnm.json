The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining board presence with powerful threats like Nightpack Ambusher. Additionally, the deck includes versatile cards like Aether Gust and Mystical Dispute to handle a variety of threats. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and secure victory through control and card advantage."
