The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value through blinking creatures and permanents for extra ETB triggers. The deck also includes powerful control elements like Teferi, Time Raveler and counterspells to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The combination of aggro creatures and control elements creates a versatile and powerful strategy."
