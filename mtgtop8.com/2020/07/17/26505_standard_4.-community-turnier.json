The deck aims to generate value by repeatedly sacrificing cards, such as Cauldron Familiar and Woe Strider, triggering abilities like Mayhem Devil and Priest of Forgotten Gods, and gaining life from Trail of Crumbs. The addition of Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion allows for additional consistency and a powerful mana sink in the late game. Bolas's Citadel serves as a win condition, providing card draw and the ability to play cards from the top of the deck."
