By utilizing cards like Witch's Oven, Cauldron Familiar, and Mayhem Devil, the deck can generate value and deal incremental damage while disrupting the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods and Claim the Firstborn allows for additional sacrifice effects and potential board control. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and constant pressure, leveraging its sacrifice mechanics to gain incremental advantage and secure victory."
