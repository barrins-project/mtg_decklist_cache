It aims to control the board and deny opponents' strategies by utilizing counterspells such as Dovin's Veto and Aether Gust, removal spells like Shatter the Sky and Elspeth Conquers Death, and card draw with Growth Spiral and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. Additionally, it plans to generate massive value with cards like Hydroid Krasis, Shark Typhoon, and Teferi, Time Raveler. The deck also maximizes mana with the help of Nissa, Who Shakes the World and land cards like Fabled Passage and Temple Garden."
