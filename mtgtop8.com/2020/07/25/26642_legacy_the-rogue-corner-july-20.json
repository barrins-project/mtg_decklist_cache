By utilizing curses like Cruel Reality and Curse of Death's Hold, along with Leyline of the Void to disrupt the opponent's graveyard strategy, the deck aims to control the board and cripple the opponent's resources. Trinisphere, Chalice of the Void, and Karn, the Great Creator help to further control the game while cards like Dark Ritual and Chrome Mox provide fast mana acceleration. The deck's win condition is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful enchantments and disrupt their game plan."
