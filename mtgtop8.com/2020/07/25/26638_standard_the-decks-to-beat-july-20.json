The deck includes flexible removal options like Aether Gust and Blast Zone, and can finish off opponents with Explosion or use Expansion for additional card draw. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency in casting spells."

The inclusion of cards like Mayhem Devil and Dreadhorde Butcher further enhances the aggressive nature of the deck, while cards like Call of the Death-Dweller and Liliana's Standard Bearer provide additional value and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creature sacrifice and direct damage."
