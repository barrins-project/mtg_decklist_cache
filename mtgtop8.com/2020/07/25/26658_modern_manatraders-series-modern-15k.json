This allows the player to play large threats like Primeval Titan and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath earlier than normal. The deck also utilizes lands like Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Field of the Dead to generate additional value and win conditions. Karn, the Great Creator provides additional utility and toolbox options, while cards like Explore and Summoner's Pact help with consistency and searching for key pieces. The deck focuses on explosive plays and overwhelming the opponent with powerful creatures and land synergies."
