It aims to quickly establish board presence and disrupt opponents with counterspells and discard spells. The deck utilizes cards like Delver of Secrets and Thieves' Guild Enforcer for early aggression, while also having options for graveyard recursion with Animate Dead, Dance of the Dead, and Necromancy. The inclusion of powerful cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Worldgorger Dragon adds versatility to the deck's game plan. Additionally, the deck features mana-fixing cards like Arcum's Astrolabe and removal spells like Abrupt Decay to control the game."

This allows the player to quickly ramp into powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath or Walking Ballista to control the game and close it out. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Teferi, Time Raveler and Force of Will to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements while also maximizing consistency with fetch lands and Astrolabe."
