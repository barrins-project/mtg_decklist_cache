It utilizes cards like Entomb, Reanimate, and Animate Dead to cheat creatures into play ahead of schedule, while also disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Thoughtseize and Unmask. The goal is to assemble the combo pieces efficiently and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats before they can establish their own game plan. The deck aims to win in the early turns of the game through a combination of reanimation and disruption."
