By using creatures like Thirsting Shade, Knight of the Ebon Legion, and Vampire Opportunist, the deck can deal consistent damage and drain the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Neoform and Golgari Findbroker allow for versatility and resource recursion. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and efficient creature synergies."
