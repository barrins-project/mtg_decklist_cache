By efficiently utilizing cards like Collected Company and Supreme Phantom, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and apply pressure on the opponent. Cards like Spell Queller and Selfless Spirit provide disruption and protection, while Empyrean Eagle boosts the power of the spirit creatures. The mana base is designed to support the aggro strategy with a mix of dual lands to ensure consistent mana production."
