The goal is to keep up a relentless pace of aggression, quickly overwhelming opponents with powerful creatures and burn spells. Sea-Dasher Octopus and Barrin, Tolarian Archmage provide additional utility and flexibility to adapt to different situations. The deck also includes a mana base that allows for consistent access to both red and blue mana sources."
