Wilderness Reclamation allows for explosive turns, while Nightpack Ambusher provides a threat that can quickly end the game if left unchecked. The deck aims to outlast opponents and win through incremental advantage."

The goal is to establish a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure with efficient creatures like Questing Beast and Lovestruck Beast. Using mana ramp from cards like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Castle Garenbrig, the deck aims to quickly play out threats and close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
