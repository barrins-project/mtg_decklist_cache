The goal is to flood the board early with low-cost creatures, while using Torbran, Thane of Red Fell to increase the damage output of all red sources. The deck also includes card draw with Light Up the Stage to ensure a steady stream of threats. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, high-powered attacks before they have a chance to stabilize."
