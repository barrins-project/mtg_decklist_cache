Additionally, powerful finishers like Ugin and Hydroid Krasis can help close out the game, while cards like Aether Gust provide additional control against opponent's threats. The deck utilizes the Simic colors to effectively ramp and draw cards, creating a strong control archetype that aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent."
