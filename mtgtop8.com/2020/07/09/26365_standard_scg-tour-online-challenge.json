The key strategy revolves around using cards like Witch's Oven, Trail of Crumbs, and Cauldron Familiar to control the board and generate value, while also utilizing cards like Mayhem Devil and Claim the Firstborn to disrupt the opponent's game plan. By sacrificing creatures, the deck aims to trigger synergy effects and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient removal and incremental advantage."

By utilizing cards like Wilderness Reclamation and Growth Spiral to ramp up mana and generate card advantage, the deck aims to outvalue its opponents in the mid to late game. Shark Typhoon provides a win condition that can create a swarm of flying tokens, while Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides additional card advantage and life gain. Overall, the deck seeks to outlast opponents and dominate the late game through efficient resource management and powerful threats."
