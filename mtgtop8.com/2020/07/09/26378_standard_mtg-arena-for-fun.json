It includes powerful cards like Rotting Regisaur and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger to apply pressure early on, while also featuring synergies with cards like Cauldron Familiar and Witch's Oven for recurring damage. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Claim the Firstborn to control the opponent's threats, while maintaining card advantage with cards like Village Rites. Its mana base is carefully constructed to support its aggressive game plan."
