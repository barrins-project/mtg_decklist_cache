The addition of Yorion, Sky Nomad allows for additional value by blinking permanents for extra ETB effects. The deck's synergy and versatility enable it to adapt to various matchups and strategies, ultimately aiming to grind out the opponent and secure victory through card advantage and overwhelming board presence."
