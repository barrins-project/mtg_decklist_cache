It aims to deal damage as quickly as possible, utilizing cards like Anax, Hardened in the Forge, Bonecrusher Giant, and Fervent Champion to apply pressure early on. Additionally, cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Embercleave enhance the damage output of the creatures in play. This deck is designed to end the game swiftly by keeping the opponent on the back foot and constantly applying pressure."
