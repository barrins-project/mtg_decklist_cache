It aims to survive the early game and take over the late game with big threats like Nissa, Ugin, and Hydroid Krasis. The deck also includes powerful board wipes like Ritual of Soot and Casualties of War to keep the opponent's board in check. By efficiently managing resources and dictating the pace of the game, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent until it can clinch victory."
