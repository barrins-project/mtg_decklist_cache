The key strategy is to use Wilderness Reclamation to generate mana on the opponent's end step, allowing for explosive turns with cards like Expansion / Explosion or Shark Typhoon. Teferi, Time Raveler helps to protect the gameplan by providing instant-speed interaction and shutting down opposing strategies. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides additional card advantage and life gain, while Kenrith, the Returned King offers a versatile win condition. Overall, the deck focuses on out-valuing and out-lasting the opponent."
