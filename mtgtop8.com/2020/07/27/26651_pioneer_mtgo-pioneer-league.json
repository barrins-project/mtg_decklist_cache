Yorion, Sky Nomad serves as both a companion and a way to generate additional value with its flicker effect. Overall, the deck aims to control the game, disrupt the opponent's plans, and eventually take over with its powerful planeswalkers and card advantage."

By using cards like Knight of the Ebon Legion, Gifted Aetherborn, and Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Additionally, cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push allow for disruption of the opponent's game plan, while maintaining a strong board presence. The inclusion of Castle Locthwain and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx provide additional card draw and mana acceleration to keep the aggression going."
