Once you have those cards in hand, you can play Inverter of Truth to swap your library with your graveyard, then play Thassa's Oracle to win the game by having no cards left in your library. The deck also includes removal spells and counterspells to control the game until you can assemble your combo."

The inclusion of Faeburrow Elder and Sylvan Caryatid helps ramp up to Niv-Mizzet quickly, while the diverse mana base enables the deck to consistently cast a wide range of spells. Additionally, Yorion, Sky Nomad serves as a powerful companion, providing additional value through its blink effect."
