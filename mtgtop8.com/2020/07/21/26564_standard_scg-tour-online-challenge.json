This allows the player to outvalue their opponent with powerful spells like Expansion / Explosion and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. The inclusion of counterspells like Mystical Dispute and Aether Gust helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Nightpack Ambusher provide additional threats and pressure. Thassa's Intervention and Castle Vantress provide versatility and card selection to help pilot the deck to victory."
