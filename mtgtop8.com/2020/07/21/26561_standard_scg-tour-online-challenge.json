The deck also relies on sacrificing creatures with cards like Claim the Firstborn, Witch's Oven, and Village Rites to trigger effects and gain value. The inclusion of cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods and Woe Strider provide additional ways to generate value and control the board. With Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast-paced aggressive strategy."
