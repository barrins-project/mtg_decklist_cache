By utilizing flash creatures and instant speed spells, the deck aims to keep the opponent on the back foot while developing its own battlefield. The key strategy is to control the board with efficient creatures like Brineborn Cutthroat and Nightpack Ambusher, while also having the ability to counter key spells with cards like Quench and Rewind. The inclusion of card draw and land ramp with Growth Spiral helps maintain tempo and card advantage throughout the game."
