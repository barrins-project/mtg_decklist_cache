Brazen Borrower and Frilled Mystic help control the board, and Brineborn Cutthroat grows stronger with each instant or sorcery played. The mana base consists of mainly Islands and Forests, with Breeding Pool and Temple of Mystery providing color fixing."

Claim the Firstborn allows the deck to steal the opponent's creatures and use them against them. Cards like Midnight Reaper and Priest of Forgotten Gods provide card draw and additional sacrifice options. The deck aims to deal damage efficiently and overwhelm the opponent, with Mayhem Devil and Woe Strider serving as key pieces in this strategy."
