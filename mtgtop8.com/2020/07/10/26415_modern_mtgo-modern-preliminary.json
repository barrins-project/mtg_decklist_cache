By dredging cards from the graveyard and utilizing graveyard recursion effects, the deck aims to rapidly fill the battlefield with powerful creatures and deal damage to the opponent. The key strategy revolves around leveraging the synergy between graveyard mechanics and powerful creature cards to overwhelm the opponent and win the game through a quick and explosive combo."
