By playing low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, the deck aims to deal damage early and often. Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish the opponent for casting spells, while Boros Charm provides flexibility and reach. The deck is designed to end the game as fast as possible before the opponent can stabilize."
