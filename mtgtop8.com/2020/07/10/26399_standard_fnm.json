Key cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, Anax, Hardened in the Forge, and Embercleave enhance the damage output of the deck. The goal is to constantly apply pressure, deal damage efficiently, and overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a defense. The deck prioritizes quick and decisive victories, using the strength of red creatures and spells to achieve the win."
