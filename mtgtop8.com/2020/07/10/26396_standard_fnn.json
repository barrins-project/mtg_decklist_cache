It includes a mix of efficient, powerful creatures like Questing Beast and Lovestruck Beast, as well as cards that support them like The Great Henge and Castle Garenbrig. The goal is to ramp up quickly, play big threats early on, and maintain pressure with efficient creatures and combat tricks. The deck aims to finish off the opponent before they can stabilize or mount a strong defense."
