The deck focuses on building a board presence quickly with low-cost creatures like Scorch Spitter and Grim Initiate, and utilizing Chandra, Acolyte of Flame to generate extra value. By applying constant pressure and utilizing efficient creature removal, the deck aims to defeat the opponent swiftly before they can stabilize."
