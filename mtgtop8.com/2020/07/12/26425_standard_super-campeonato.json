The deck also includes powerful removal spells like Elspeth Conquers Death and Shatter the Sky to control the board and keep the opponent's threats in check. Additionally, the deck includes efficient threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Hydroid Krasis to apply pressure and close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted."
