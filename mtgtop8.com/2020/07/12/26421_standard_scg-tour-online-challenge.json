The deck aims to stall the opponent's board with board wipes like Shatter the Sky, and generate card advantage with powerful draw spells like Boon of the Wish-Giver. The deck also includes a companion, Yorion, Sky Nomad, to take advantage of its ability to blink permanents and generate additional value."
