By using cards like Growth Spiral and Cultivate to accelerate mana production, the deck aims to play high impact cards like Mass Manipulation, Nissa, Who Shakes the World, and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. It also relies on powerful creatures like Hydroid Krasis and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to provide both card advantage and threats on the board. The mana base is optimized for consistency and allows for flexibility in casting spells of different colors."
