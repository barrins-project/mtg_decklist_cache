By playing creatures like Pelt Collector, Lovestruck Beast, and Questing Beast early on and using cards like Primal Might and The Great Henge to boost their power, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and win the game before the opponent can stabilize. The deck also includes cards like Scavenging Ooze and Gemrazer to disrupt the opponent's game plan and provide additional utility."
