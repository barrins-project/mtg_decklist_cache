The deck aims to ramp up its mana with cards like Growth Spiral and Wilderness Reclamation to cast powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Shark Typhoon. It also includes cards like Nightpack Ambusher for additional board presence and pressure. The mana base is focused on fixing colors efficiently to ensure the deck can cast its spells consistently."
