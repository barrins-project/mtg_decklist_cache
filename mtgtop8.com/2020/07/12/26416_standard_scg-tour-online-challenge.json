Once enough mana is generated, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful spells and threats such as Expansion / Explosion and Shark Typhoon. Nissa, Who Shakes the World provides additional ramp and power, while cards like Aether Gust and Mystical Dispute help to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to out value and outlast opponents through careful resource management and powerful late-game threats."
