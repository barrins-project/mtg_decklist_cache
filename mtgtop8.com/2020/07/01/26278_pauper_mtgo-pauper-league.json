The deck focuses on maintaining board control using creatures like Faerie Seer and Ninja of the Deep Hours while disrupting the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Counterspell and removal spells like Skred and Lightning Bolt. Mystic Sanctuary is used to recycle powerful spells from the graveyard, while card draw spells like Preordain and Ponder help to find key pieces of the deck."

The deck relies on tempo plays with Guardian of the Guildpact and First-Sphere Gargantua to stabilize the board and eventually win the game through attrition."
