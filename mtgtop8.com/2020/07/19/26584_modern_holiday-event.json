The deck includes various mana dorks to ramp up quickly, along with powerful payoffs such as Shaman of the Pack and Craterhoof Behemoth to finish off the opponent. The deck also has toolbox options like Chord of Calling and Collected Company to find key pieces when needed. The combination of mana acceleration and powerful creatures makes this deck a formidable force in Modern 1 vs 1 matches."
