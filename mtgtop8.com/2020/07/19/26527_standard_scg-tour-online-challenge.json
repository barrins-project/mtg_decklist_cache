By utilizing cards like Wilderness Reclamation and Growth Spiral to ramp up mana and draw cards, the deck aims to outvalue opponents by generating card advantage and efficiently countering threats with Aether Gust and Mystical Dispute. The deck also has flexibility in its removal options with Expansion / Explosion. The win conditions of the deck come from Shark Typhoon, Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and other threat cards that can close out the game."
