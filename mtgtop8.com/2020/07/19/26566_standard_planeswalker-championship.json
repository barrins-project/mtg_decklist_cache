            "notes": "The key strategy of this deck revolves around controlling the board through counterspells and removal spells while generating incremental advantage with cards like Growth Spiral and Wilderness Reclamation. The deck aims to stall the game until it can take over with powerful threats like Shark Typhoon and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. The inclusion of Nightpack Ambusher provides another win condition while also providing additional board presence. Overall, the deck seeks to disrupt the opponent's game plan and eventually overwhelm them with its late-game power."
