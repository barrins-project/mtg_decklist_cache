Supporting them with Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell to maximize damage output. Runaway Steam-Kin helps ramp up mana for explosive plays, while Anax, Hardened in the Forge provides resilience to removal spells. Light Up the Stage is used to refill the hand and maintain pressure on the opponent. Castle Embereth provides additional damage boost to finish off the opponent swiftly."
