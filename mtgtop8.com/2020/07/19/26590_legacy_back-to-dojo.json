The goal is to build up a storm count through casting multiple spells in a turn, culminating in a lethal Tendrils of Agony to finish off the opponent. Burning Wish acts as a versatile tutor, allowing access to key combo pieces from the sideboard. The deck aims to execute its combo efficiently and effectively with tight sequencing and resource management."
