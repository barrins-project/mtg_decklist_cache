It utilizes cards like Tarmogoyf and Grim Flayer to apply pressure, while also having disruption in forms of Thoughtseize, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Liliana of the Veil to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Lurrus of the Dream-Den allows for recursion of key cards, and the deck also includes versatile removal spells like Fatal Push and Assassin's Trophy. The deck aims to quickly close out games while disrupting the opponent's strategy."
