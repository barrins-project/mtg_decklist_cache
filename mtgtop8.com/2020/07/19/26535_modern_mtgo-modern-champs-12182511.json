The key strategy is to cascade into \"Restore Balance\" with cards like \"As Foretold\" or \"Electrodominance,\" effectively resetting the board in your favor.

The deck aims to stall the opponent's game plan, disrupt their strategy, and ultimately out-value them with powerful cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The mana base is optimized for flexibility and consistency, allowing the player to efficiently cast a variety of spells while maintaining control of the battlefield."
