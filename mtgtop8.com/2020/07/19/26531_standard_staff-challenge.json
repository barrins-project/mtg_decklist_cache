By sacrificing creatures like Cauldron Familiar and Gutterbones with effects like Mayhem Devil and Priest of Forgotten Gods, the deck generates value and punishes the opponent. Cards like Dreadhorde Butcher and Woe Strider provide additional threats and ways to trigger sacrifice effects. With a mix of sacrifice outlets, recurring threats, and aggressive creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a relentless assault while disrupting their game plan."
