By using cards like Giant Killer and Selfless Savior for control, Hunted Witness and Garrison Cat for early aggression, and Venerated Loxodon and Seasoned Hallowblade for power, the deck aims to buff its creatures with Glorious Anthem and Basri's Solidarity to increase their effectiveness. Unbreakable Formation provides protection and a board boost, while Castle Ardenvale and Raise the Alarm offer additional creature generation. The strategy is to maintain pressure and utilize the power of many small creatures to defeat the opponent."
