By utilizing a low mana curve and efficient creatures like Fervent Champion and Anax, Hardened in the Forge, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Key cards like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell provide additional sources of damage and help to close out games swiftly. The goal is to apply constant pressure to opponents and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
