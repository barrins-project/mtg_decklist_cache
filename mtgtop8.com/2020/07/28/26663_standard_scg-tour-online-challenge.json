The deck also includes threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, Brazen Borrower, and Nightpack Ambusher to apply pressure and win the game. Utilizing card draw and protection spells, this deck aims to outvalue and outlast its opponents in a 1 vs 1 format."

The deck utilizes powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Nightpack Ambusher, while also having access to tempo plays with Brazen Borrower. Wilderness Reclamation is used to generate mana advantage, allowing for explosive turns with Expansion / Explosion or Shark Typhoon. With a mix of counterspells, removal, and card advantage engines, this deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents in a grindy game."

With Jegantha, the Wellspring as a companion, the deck can generate additional mana for more aggressive plays.
