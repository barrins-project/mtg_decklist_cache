The deck aims to control the board early on with efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, while also utilizing burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike to finish off the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Boros Charm and Skullcrack provide additional reach and versatility in dealing damage. The key to success with this deck is to maintain pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
