It also includes cards that generate card advantage and provide incremental value over time, such as Elspeth Conquers Death and Shark Typhoon. The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value by blinking permanents for extra triggers. The deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a dominant board presence with powerful flying threats like Dream Trawler and Archon of Sun's Grace."
