It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while gradually building card advantage through cards like Sylvan Library and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns to further control the board. By constantly disrupting the opponent's plays and generating value, it aims to outlast and outgrind the opponent until it can secure a win through attrition."
