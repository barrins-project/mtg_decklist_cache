By playing a variety of ramp spells like Growth Spiral and Cultivate, the deck aims to consistently cast big threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Hydroid Krasis. The deck also includes removal spells like Eliminate and Casualties of War to deal with opponent's threats. With the help of powerful planeswalkers like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Tamiyo, Collector of Tales, the deck can generate immense value and outvalue the opponent in the mid to late game."
