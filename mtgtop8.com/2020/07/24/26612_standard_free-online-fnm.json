The synergy between Yorion and cards like Omen of the Sea and Elspeth Conquers Death allows for continuous value generation and out-valuing opponents in the late game."

By playing powerful early game creatures like Pelt Collector and Lovestruck Beast, followed by mid-game threats like Questing Beast and Yorvo, Lord of Garenbrig, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence and apply pressure. Supporting cards like Vivien, Arkbow Ranger and The Great Henge provide additional card advantage and power boosts to maintain the aggression. Overall, the deck's strategy revolves around deploying cost-effective threats and utilizing its efficient mana curve to apply constant pressure on the opponent."
