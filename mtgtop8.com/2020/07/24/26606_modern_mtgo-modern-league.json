            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly and aggressively deal damage to the opponent using cheap and efficient burn spells, as well as creatures with prowess abilities that can grow in power with each spell cast. The inclusion of Jegantha as a companion provides additional mana acceleration and flexibility to help maintain a fast pace of play. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and end the game quickly before they have a chance to stabilize or mount a strong defense."
