            "notes": "The deck focuses on swarming the board with small, cheap creatures to overwhelm the opponent early in the game. The interaction between cards like Venerated Loxodon and Basri's Solidarity helps to boost the power of these creatures, while cards like Selfless Savior and Giant Killer provide protection and removal. The goal is to establish a wide board presence quickly and buff them with anthem effects like Glorious Anthem to deal large amounts of damage before the opponent can stabilize. The deck also has some resilience with cards like Unbreakable Formation and Basri Ket to protect against board wipes."
