By utilizing fast mana ramping and efficient creatures like Lovestruck Beast and Questing Beast, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain a strong board presence throughout the game. In addition, cards like Ram Through and Garruk's Uprising provide added utility and card advantage to help push through any potential blockers or removal spells. This mono green aggro deck aims to close out the game quickly and efficiently."
