The deck utilizes sacrifice outlets like Witch's Oven and Priest of Forgotten Gods to generate extra benefits and trigger effects such as Mayhem Devil's damage. It also uses spells like Claim the Firstborn and Call of the Death-Dweller to steal and resurrect creatures for additional advantage. The deck maintains a strong mana base with a mix of lands and draws cards with Castle Locthwain and Village Rites. Overall, its key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, relentless aggression."
