The deck aims to gain advantage by sacrificing creatures for various effects, such as dealing damage to opponents or drawing cards. It also includes powerful cards like Korvold, Fae-Cursed King and Bolas's Citadel to further control the game and generate additional value. This control strategy allows the deck to outvalue and outlast opponents in a 1 vs 1 format."
