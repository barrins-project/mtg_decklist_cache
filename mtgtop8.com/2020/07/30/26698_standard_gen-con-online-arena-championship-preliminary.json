Additional creatures like Judith, the Scourge Diva and Tajic, Legion's Edge provide additional aggression and removal options. By consistently applying pressure and overwhelming the opponent with a flurry of aggressive creatures, this deck aims to quickly close out games before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
