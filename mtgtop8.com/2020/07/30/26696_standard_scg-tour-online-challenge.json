The deck aims to gradually gain incremental advantages through efficient card advantage and tempo swings, eventually overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats such as Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Shark Typhoon. The inclusion of Castle Vantress and Blast Zone provides additional utility and flexibility in dealing with opposing threats, making it a versatile and adaptable control archetype."

By playing efficient creatures like Stonecoil Serpent and Syr Faren, the Hengehammer along with pump spells like Titanic Growth and Giant Growth, the deck aims to deal quick and consistent damage to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Garruk, Unleashed and Heroic Intervention provide additional support and protection for the aggressive strategy. Castle Garenbrig helps ramp up mana for bigger plays in the mid to late game."
