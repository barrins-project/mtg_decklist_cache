With support from cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Goblin Engineer, the deck can search for and protect key pieces of the combo. Additionally, powerful cards like Wurmcoil Engine and Klothys, God of Destiny provide additional threats and utility. The deck aims to quickly establish its combo while controlling the board with disruptive cards like Pyroblast and Ensnaring Bridge. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy that can quickly end games."
