            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control your opponent's resources and playstyle through the use of curses. By using cards such as Curse of Misfortunes and Curse of Fool's Wisdom, you can slowly chip away at your opponent's advantage while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Trinisphere and Leyline of the Void. Helm of Obedience and Cruel Reality provide win conditions, while Karn, the Great Creator can shut down artifacts and provide additional utility. The deck uses a combination of disruption and win conditions to dominate the game."
