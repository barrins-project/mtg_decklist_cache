The deck also includes card advantage engines like Edgewall Innkeeper and The Great Henge to maintain tempo and outvalue the opponent. The inclusion of Vivien, Arkbow Ranger and Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse provide additional utility and flexibility to adapt to different board states. Castle Locthwain and Fabled Passage offer some card filtering and fixing for the mana base."

By utilizing cards like Selfless Savior and Garrison Cat for early defense, followed by powerful creatures like Venerated Loxodon and Seasoned Hallowblade, the deck aims to maintain constant pressure on the opponent. Unbreakable Formation and Glorious Anthem provide strong buffing effects to further bolster the army of creatures. The inclusion of Tithe Taker and Giant Killer adds disruption and removal options, while Castle Ardenvale offers additional creature generation. Overall, the strategy revolves around aggressive creature play and maintaining a strong board presence."
