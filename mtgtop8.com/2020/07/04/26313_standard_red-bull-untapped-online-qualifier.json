By utilizing cards like Witch's Oven and Cauldron Familiar, the deck can generate a steady stream of synergy and resources. Mayhem Devil can deal damage with each sacrifice, while cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods can help disrupt the opponent's strategy. Bolas's Citadel provides card advantage and potential for a game-ending combo. Overall, the key strategy involves maintaining control of the game through sacrificing and generating value from various pieces on the board."

The deck focuses on playing low-cost creatures like Robber of the Rich and Fervent Champion, and then buffing them with cards like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell. The goal is to deal damage as quickly as possible and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The key strategy is to maintain constant pressure on the opponent and prevent them from gaining control of the game."
