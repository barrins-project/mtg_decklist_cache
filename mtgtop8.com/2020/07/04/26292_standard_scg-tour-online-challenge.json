It aims to ramp up mana quickly with cards like Growth Spiral and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, while also utilizing card advantage with cards like Teferi, Master of Time. The deck also includes threats like Hydroid Krasis and Shark Typhoon to pressure opponents and finish games. The key strategy is to outvalue opponents with versatile spells and resilient threats."
