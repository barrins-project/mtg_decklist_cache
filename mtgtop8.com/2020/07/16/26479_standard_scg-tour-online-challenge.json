The deck aims to ramp up its mana quickly using cards like Growth Spiral and Wilderness Reclamation, eventually overwhelming the opponent with powerful spells like Expansion / Explosion and Shark Typhoon. Teferi, Time Raveler is key in disrupting the opponent's strategy, while Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides card advantage and stabilizes the deck's life total. This deck is built to outlast and outvalue opponents in a long game."
