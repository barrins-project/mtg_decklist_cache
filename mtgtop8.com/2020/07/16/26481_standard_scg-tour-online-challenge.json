            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to build a fast and aggressive board presence using creatures like Pelt Collector, Robber of the Rich, and Stonecoil Serpent, while controlling the opponent with removal spells like Bonecrusher Giant and Primal Might. The goal is to quickly apply pressure on the opponent and close out the game with cards like Embercleave and Questing Beast. The Gruul Spellbreaker and Zhur-Taa Goblin provide additional ways to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Scavenging Ooze and Garruk's Harbinger offer versatility and card advantage."

With a mix of mana ramp from cards like Castle Garenbrig and powerful finishers like The Great Henge, this deck aims to dominate the battlefield and secure a quick victory against the opponent."
