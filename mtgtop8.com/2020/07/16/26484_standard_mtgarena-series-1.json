By playing multiple low-cost creatures like Pelt Collector and Lovestruck Beast, the goal is to quickly build a board presence and deal damage early on. Primal Might and The Great Henge provide additional ways to buff creatures and generate card advantage. Garruk, Unleashed serves as both a threat and a source of additional creatures. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent from the start and maintain that pressure throughout the game."
