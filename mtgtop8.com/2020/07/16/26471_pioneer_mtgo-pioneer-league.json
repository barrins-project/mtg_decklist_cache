The card advantage provided by Narset, Parter of Veils and Dig Through Time, along with the token generation from Shark Typhoon, helps maintain a strong grip on the game and ultimately secure victory through attrition."

The inclusion of mana dorks like Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves allows for a fast start, while Eldritch Evolution and Pia and Kiran Nalaar provide additional creature options and utility. The mana base supports the deck's aggressive strategy with a mix of green, white, and red sources."
