It aims to counter and remove threats while ramping up to powerful late-game plays like Shark Typhoon and Expansion/Explosion. Nightpack Ambusher and Uro provide additional threats and card advantage, while Brazen Borrower offers versatility. The deck also includes various counter spells and removal to control the board and protect your game plan. The key strategy is to stabilize early, ramp into powerful spells, and outvalue your opponent in the late game."
