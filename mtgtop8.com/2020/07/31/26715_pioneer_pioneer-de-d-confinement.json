It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by using cards like Thoughtseize, Eliminate, and Fatal Push, while also using counterspells like Censor to further hinder them. The deck utilizes card draw and self-mill through Dig Through Time, Opt, and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy to find the necessary combo pieces - Thassa's Oracle, Jace, Wielder of Mysteries, and Inverter of Truth. The deck's land base is optimized to support its dual-color casting requirements."

The deck also utilizes Niv-Mizzet Reborn as a powerful card advantage engine, alongside Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to gain life and draw cards. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents by efficiently answering threats while generating card advantage to eventually overwhelm the opponent."
