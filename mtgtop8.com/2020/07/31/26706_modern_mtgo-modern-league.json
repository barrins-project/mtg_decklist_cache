The deck also aims to pressure the opponent with powerful threats like Glorybringer and Chandra, Torch of Defiance, while generating card advantage through Seasoned Pyromancer and Bloodbraid Elf. Klothys, God of Destiny provides additional value and graveyard hate. Overall, the deck looks to grind out advantages and close out the game with efficient threats."
