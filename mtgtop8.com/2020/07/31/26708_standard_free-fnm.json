The deck also aims to generate card advantage and board presence with Hydroid Krasis and Shark Typhoon, while having powerful late-game plays with Casualties of War. Nissa, Who Shakes the World is used to generate extra mana and pressure the opponent, while Tamiyo, Collector of Tales provides card selection and graveyard recursion. Castle Vantress is there for additional card selection and value."
