By controlling the board with counterspells like Mystical Dispute and Aether Gust, as well as removal spells like Storm's Wrath, you can outvalue your opponent and win the game with big threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Brazen Borrower. The deck focuses on controlling the game, ramping up mana, and finishing off the opponent with powerful spells and creatures."
