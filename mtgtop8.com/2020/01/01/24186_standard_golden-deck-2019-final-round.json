The key idea is to keep up tempo and pressure on the opponent while controlling the board with counterspells and bounce effects. The deck aims to utilize the evasion and card advantage provided by Curious Obsession to maintain a steady stream of threats while keeping the opponent on the back foot. Through efficient use of spells and creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory."
