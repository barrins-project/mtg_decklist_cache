The deck aims to control the game tempo and grind out incremental advantages before ultimately winning through either a planeswalker's ultimate ability, a powerful instant like Sphinx's Revelation, or a secure win condition like Elspeth, Sun's Champion or Castle Ardenvale's token generation. The deck's strength lies in its ability to adapt to different matchups and outvalue the opponent in the long game."
