The key strategy is to assemble the Urzatron lands to generate massive amounts of mana, allowing for powerful plays such as recurring creatures with Dinrova Horror and Mnemonic Wall, and drawing multiple cards with Mulldrifter. The inclusion of Stonehorn Dignitary helps stall aggressive opponents, while cards like Pulse of Murasa and Weather the Storm provide valuable life gain. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents through efficient resource management and powerful late-game plays."
