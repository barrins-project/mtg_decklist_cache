With powerful keywords and abilities like trample, lifelink, and double strike, each creature becomes a threat that can quickly take control of the game. Additionally, disruptive cards like Collective Brutality and removal spells like Murderous Rider help disrupt opponents' game plans while keeping the pressure on. Overall, this deck focuses on aggressive plays and overwhelming opponents with a board full of powerful creatures."
