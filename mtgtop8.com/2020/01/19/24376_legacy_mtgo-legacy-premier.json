The deck also seeks to maintain card advantage and tempo with card selection and draw spells like Ponder, Preordain, and Brainstorm. Additionally, it includes efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to control the board and keep the opponent on the backfoot."

Lightning Bolt provides removal and reach, while the mana base allows for flexibility and consistency in casting the spells. Overall, the deck aims to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent to close out the game quickly."
