By utilizing powerful sliver creatures with abilities that buff each other, along with Aether Vial for quick creature deployment and mana fixing, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and outpace the opponent. With a mix of evasion, protection, and removal options, the deck is designed to maintain momentum and pressure throughout the game, making it difficult for the opponent to establish a solid defense."
