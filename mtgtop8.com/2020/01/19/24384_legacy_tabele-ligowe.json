By continuously removing threats and disrupting the opponent's hand, while generating tokens and card advantage, the deck aims to outvalue and outpace the opponent in the long game. The deck also includes lands that can interact with the opponent's graveyard, as well as utility lands to provide additional advantages. Overall, the strategy revolves around controlling the game and grinding out incremental advantages to secure victory."
