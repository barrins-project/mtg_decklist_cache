            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of low-cost creatures and burn spells to finish off the opponent. The key concept revolves around utilizing efficient cards like Seeker of the Way and Squadron Hawk to apply pressure early on, while also utilizing versatile spells like Lightning Bolt and Journey to Nowhere for removal and reach. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Battle Screech and Rally the Peasants to go wide with tokens for a strong finish. The Boros Aggro archetype aims to be aggressive and proactive in its approach to winning the game."
