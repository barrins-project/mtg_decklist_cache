By combining efficient aura spells with creatures that are difficult to deal with, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with big, hexproof threats. The deck also includes a small protection package to ensure that the creatures stay on the battlefield once enchanted. The goal is to quickly build up a strong board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
