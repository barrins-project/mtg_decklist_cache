The deck aims to quickly deploy threats and protect them with countermagic, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Wasteland. This deck thrives on early game aggression and disruption, aiming to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The key strategy is to use cards like Altar of Dementia and Bridge from Below to create a massive board presence and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creatures and graveyard synergies. Cabal Therapy is used to disrupt the opponent's game plan while Carrion Feeder acts as a sacrifice outlet to trigger various abilities. The deck aims to combo off and create an overwhelming board state to quickly close out the game."
