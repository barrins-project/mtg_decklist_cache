This aggro-weenie white deck aims to flood the board with smaller creatures like Thraben Inspector and Knight of the White Orchid, supported by powerful enchantments like Heliod, Sun-Crowned and Stasis Snare. The deck also includes cards like Alseid of Life's Bounty and Daxos, Blessed by the Sun to provide protection and lifegain. With efficient mana generation from Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx, this deck can quickly build a strong board presence and apply pressure to the opponent."
