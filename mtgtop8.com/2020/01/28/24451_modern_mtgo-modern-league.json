This aggressive playstyle is supported by a suite of removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember, as well as counterspells like Stubborn Denial. Traverse the Ulvenwald and Mishra's Bauble help to find key cards and maintain card advantage, while Temur Battle Rage provides additional reach to close out games. Overall, the deck aims for a fast and efficient win through resource management and careful timing."

The goal is to quickly lower the opponent's life total and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize. The deck also includes card draw options like Light Up the Stage and Bedlam Reveler to ensure a constant stream of threats and burn spells. This deck prioritizes speed and efficiency in order to secure a swift victory."
