By utilizing efficient removal spells like Wild Slash and Shrapnel Blast, as well as evasive creatures like Gingerbrute and Stonecoil Serpent, the deck aims to deal rapid damage to the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like The Royal Scions and Emry, Lurker of the Loch provide additional card advantage and utility to keep the pressure on the opponent."
