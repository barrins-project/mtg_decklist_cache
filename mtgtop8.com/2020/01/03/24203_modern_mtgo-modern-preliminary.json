This is supported by efficient creature cards like Ice-Fang Coatl and Snapcaster Mage, along with card advantage spells like Archmage's Charm and Cryptic Command. The land base provides flexibility with mana fixing and disruption with cards like Field of Ruin and Mystic Sanctuary. The overall strategy revolves around controlling the game tempo and out-valuing the opponent."
