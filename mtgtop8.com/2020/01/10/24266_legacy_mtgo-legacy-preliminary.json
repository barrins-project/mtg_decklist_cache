            "notes": "The deck relies heavily on powerful disruptive artifacts like Blood Moon, Trinisphere, and Chalice of the Void to slow down the opponent's game plan. It also uses aggressive creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Bonecrusher Giant to quickly close out the game. The key strategy is to lock down the opponent's mana base with disruptive cards while clocking them with efficient threats. Karn, the Great Creator and Chandra, Torch of Defiance provide additional utility and card advantage to keep the pressure on the opponent. This deck aims to win through a combination of disruption and aggression."
