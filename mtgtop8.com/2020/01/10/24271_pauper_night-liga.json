The deck utilizes creatures with ETB effects to give value, countermagic to disrupt opponents' game plans, and burn spells for removal or reach. The mana base includes utility lands like Mystic Sanctuary and Ash Barrens for flexibility. The deck aims to stabilize the board with removal spells like Skred and finish the game with evasive creatures like Ninja of the Deep Hours."
