The deck aims to be proactive in its gameplay, applying pressure early on and closing out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The mana base is designed to support casting both red and black spells efficiently. Overall, the deck's strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and disruption."

This deck aims to control the game and win through efficient beats and disruption."
