The deck uses various removal spells like Chainer's Edict and Defile to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, there are cards like Thorn of the Black Rose to generate card advantage and Whisper Agent for evasion. The deck aims to close out the game quickly and efficiently by overwhelming the opponent with a relentless assault."
