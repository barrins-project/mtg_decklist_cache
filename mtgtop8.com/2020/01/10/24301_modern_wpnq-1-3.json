            "notes": "The deck focuses on generating value through artifacts and snow permanents, utilizing the powerful abilities of Urza, Lord High Artificer and Oko, Thief of Crowns to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to stabilize the board early with efficient creatures like Ice-Fang Coatl and Gilded Goose, while also leveraging counter spells like Cryptic Command and Metallic Rebuke to control the tempo of the game. Emry, Lurker of the Loch provides additional recursion and card advantage, while cards like Arcum's Astrolabe and Mishra's Bauble help fix mana and draw cards. The deck's strategy revolves around grinding out incremental advantages and out-valuing the opponent in the long game."
