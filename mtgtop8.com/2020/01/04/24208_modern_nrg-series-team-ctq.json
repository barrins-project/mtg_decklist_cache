The deck aims to win through aggressive creature attacks and strategic disruption."

The deck focuses on controlling the game with cards like Karn Liberated and Oblivion Stone, while also providing card selection and ramp with cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map. The goal is to outvalue the opponent with efficient threats and disruption, ultimately overpowering them with superior board presence and resource advantage."
