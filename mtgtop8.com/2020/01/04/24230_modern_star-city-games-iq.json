The deck focuses on generating value through cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer, and using cards like Cryptic Command to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also has the option to generate a combo win condition with Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek. With a variety of mana sources and card draw engines, the deck aims to out-value the opponent and pull ahead in the late game."
