By utilizing cards like Champion of the Parish and Thalia's Lieutenant to pump up the team, and disruptive creatures like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter to disrupt the opponent's game plan, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient aggression. Aether Vial helps to cheat creatures into play and maintain pressure on the opponent. The mana base is streamlined to maximize the consistency of casting the creatures in the deck."

By maximizing the use of low-cost, efficient spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, combined with creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage, the deck aims to close out the game as fast as possible. Additional card draw and prowess triggers from cards like Bedlam Reveler and Light Up the Stage help maintain pressure and keep the opponent on the back foot."
