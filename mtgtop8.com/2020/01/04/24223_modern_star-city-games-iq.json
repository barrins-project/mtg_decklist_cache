By utilizing cards like Galvanic Blast and Cranial Plating, along with synergy from cards like Arcbound Ravager and Master of Etherium, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of evasive threats and direct damage. Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum help accelerate the deck's mana production, while cards like Inkmoth Nexus provide alternate win conditions. The goal is to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

By utilizing mana dorks like Noble Hierarch and Gilded Goose, the deck can ramp into its threats early on. Additionally, the deck has a versatile suite of removal spells in Path to Exile and interaction in Spell Queller to control the board."

The deck also includes disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to control the opponent's hand and removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to deal with threats. Stubborn Denial provides protection for your key creatures, while Temur Battle Rage can provide a sudden burst of damage to close out the game."

The deck aims to combo off by casting Creeping Chill and Conflagrate from the graveyard for massive damage and disruption, overwhelming the opponent with a relentless stream of creatures and burn spells. The synergy between dredge cards and graveyard recursion is the key to the deck's success."
