The deck also features control elements such as Walking Ballista and Oblivion Sower to deal with threats from the opponent. The lands in the deck provide additional utility and mana acceleration, while cards like World Breaker can disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to efficiently ramp up mana and control the game until the win condition can be achieved through powerful threats."
