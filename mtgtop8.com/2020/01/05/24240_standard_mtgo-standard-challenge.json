This is accomplished by utilizing sacrifice synergies with cards like Witch's Oven, Priest of Forgotten Gods, and Mayhem Devil to continually chip away at the opponent's life total while generating value. Additionally, Claim the Firstborn allows for stealing key creatures from the opponent's side of the battlefield, further disrupting their game plan. This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently, leading to a swift victory."

By using cards like Raise the Alarm and Venerated Loxodon to quickly populate the board, combined with support cards like Unbreakable Formation and Heraldic Banner to buff your creatures, you aim to outpace your opponent and deal damage quickly. With a focus on aggressive tactics and efficient creature placement, this deck aims to win the game before your opponent has a chance to establish their own strategy."
