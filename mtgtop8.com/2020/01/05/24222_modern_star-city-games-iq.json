Once enough lands are in play, the goal is to cast Scapeshift to sacrifice lands and search for multiple copies of Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle, triggering its ability to deal damage to the opponent. Primeval Titan and Sakura-Tribe Elder also help search for and ramp into more lands to increase the damage output. The deck aims to quickly assemble the combo and burn the opponent out in one explosive turn."
