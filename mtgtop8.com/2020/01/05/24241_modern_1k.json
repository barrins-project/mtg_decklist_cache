The deck focuses on controlling the game with removal spells like Oblivion Stone and World Breaker, while also having threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Wurmcoil Engine to close out the game. The deck also includes cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to help find the UrzaTron lands efficiently."
