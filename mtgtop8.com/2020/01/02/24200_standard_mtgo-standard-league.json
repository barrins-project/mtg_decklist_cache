With strong threats like Korvold, Fae-Cursed King and Vraska, Golgari Queen, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents. The mana base is designed to ensure consistency and allow for efficient casting of spells. Overall, the deck is built around gaining incremental advantages and grinding out wins through attrition."
