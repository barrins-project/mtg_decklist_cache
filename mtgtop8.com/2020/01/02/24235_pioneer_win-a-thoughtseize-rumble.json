Cards like Opt, Izzet Charm, Lightning Axe, and Strategic Planning help fuel the graveyard while also providing additional value. Young Pyromancer and Thing in the Ice serve as additional threats, while Treasure Cruise provides card advantage to keep the aggression going. The mana base is carefully crafted to ensure consistency in casting spells while also supporting the deck's aggressive game plan."
