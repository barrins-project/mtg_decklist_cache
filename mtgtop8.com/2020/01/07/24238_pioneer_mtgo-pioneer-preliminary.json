The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push while controlling the board with removal spells like Murderous Rider and Ultimate Price. Rankle, Master of Pranks provides additional value and disruption, while cards like Spawn of Mayhem help close out the game quickly. The deck utilizes Castle Locthwain for card advantage and Mutavault for additional threats."
