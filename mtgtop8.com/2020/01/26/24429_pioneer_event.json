By utilizing cards like Supreme Phantom and Empyrean Eagle to buff the team, as well as disruptive creatures like Spell Queller and Brazen Borrower to control the opponent's board, the deck aims to maintain a steady flow of pressure while protecting its own assets. With a focus on flying creatures and tempo plays, the deck is designed to finish the game quickly and decisively."
