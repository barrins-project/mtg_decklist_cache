By triggering Valakut's ability, the deck aims to deal a massive amount of damage to the opponent in one turn, often leading to a game-winning combo. The deck also includes cards like Once Upon a Time and Explore to help search for key pieces and accelerate the combo. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Dryad of the Ilysian Grove and Field of the Dead provide additional value and synergy with the main combo strategy."
