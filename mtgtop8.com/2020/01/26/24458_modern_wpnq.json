The deck's win condition is to play Death's Shadow early and protect it with counterspells like Stubborn Denial, finishing off the opponent quickly with powerful spells like Temur Battle Rage. It aims to be aggressive and efficient in its gameplay, taking advantage of its synergy with Death's Shadow to overwhelm opponents."

By utilizing cards like Hardened Scales and Metallic Mimic, the deck aims to pump up these creatures even faster. Heliod, Sun-Crowned serves as a secondary win condition by creating a powerful lifelink combo with Spike Feeder. The deck also includes efficient mana ramp with Noble Hierarch and Birds of Paradise, along with solid card advantage from Collected Company and Once Upon a Time."

By sacrificing lands and triggering Valakut, the player can deal massive amounts of damage to their opponent's creatures or their opponent directly. The addition of cards like Dryad of the Ilysian Grove and Castle Garenbrig help accelerate the combo even further, making it a powerful and efficient win condition in Modern 1 vs 1 matches."
