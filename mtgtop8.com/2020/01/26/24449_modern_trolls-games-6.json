The deck focuses on control elements such as Oblivion Stone and All Is Dust to clear the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, the deck includes ways to tutor for key pieces with Expedition Map and Ancient Stirrings, ensuring consistency in assembling the UrzaTron lands. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with massive threats."
