It aims to protect its Planeswalkers, such as Teferi, Time Raveler and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, while also maintaining board control with cards like Detention Sphere and Supreme Verdict. The deck has a mix of reactive and proactive cards to handle various threats, making it difficult for the opponent to establish a dominant board presence. Overall, it seeks to establish control of the game and grind out a win through card advantage and incremental advantage."
