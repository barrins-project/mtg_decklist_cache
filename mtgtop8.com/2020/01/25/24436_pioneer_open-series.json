It aims to stabilize the game with sweepers like Supreme Verdict while maintaining card advantage and tempo with Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Castle Vantress. The win condition is typically closing out the game with a mix of planeswalkers, creature threats like Brazen Borrower, and Torrential Gearhulk to control the opponent's spells. The deck's mana base is designed to support the control elements while ensuring consistency in hitting land drops for spells."
