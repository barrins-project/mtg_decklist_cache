The deck also aims to generate card advantage and gain life with cards like Hydroid Krasis and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. The inclusion of large creatures like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and World Breaker provides a strong finisher for the deck. The mana base is designed to support the ramp strategy and ensure consistent access to green mana sources."
