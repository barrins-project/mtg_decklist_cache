By using cards like Ensoul Artifact and Shrapnel Blast, the deck can quickly turn small artifacts into powerful threats. The inclusion of creatures like Stonecoil Serpent and Hangarback Walker allows for versatility in combat. Emry, Lurker of the Loch helps to recur artifacts from the graveyard, while cards like Wild Slash provide additional removal. With a mix of aggressive creatures and powerful artifacts, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and consistent attack strategy."
