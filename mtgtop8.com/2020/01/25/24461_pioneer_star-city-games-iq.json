The deck aims to use Underworld Breach to continuously cast spells from the graveyard, eventually leading to a win condition with Thassa's Oracle. The deck also utilizes Vizier of Tumbling Sands to untap Lotus Field multiple times in a turn for additional mana advantage. Overall, the deck focuses on assembling the combo pieces quickly and efficiently to close out the game."

By using efficient threats like Knight of the Ebon Legion, Spawn of Mayhem, and Pack Rat, along with removal spells like Fatal Push and Hero's Downfall, the deck aims to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total while controlling the board. The inclusion of disruptive cards like Thoughtseize and Rankle, Master of Pranks helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan, allowing the deck to maintain pressure and close out games efficiently."
