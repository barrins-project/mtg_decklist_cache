It also includes disruptive elements like Thoughtseize and removal spells like Fatal Push and Murderous Rider to control the board. The goal is to keep the pressure on the opponent and disrupt their game plan while steadily reducing their life total. Castle Locthwain provides additional card advantage, while Mutavault and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth ensure mana consistency."
