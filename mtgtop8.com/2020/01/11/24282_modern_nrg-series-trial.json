Protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense help to protect your creatures from removal spells, while cards like Scale Up and Become Immense can quickly close out games with a massive damage boost. By combining these elements, the deck aims to win the game through infect damage before the opponent can mount a defense."
