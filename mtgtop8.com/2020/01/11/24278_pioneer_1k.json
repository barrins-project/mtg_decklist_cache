The deck also includes powerful enchantments like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Incendiary Flow to further pressure the opponent. Boros Charm provides flexibility and protection, while lands like Battlefield Forge, Inspiring Vantage, and Sacred Foundry ensure consistent colored mana sources for casting spells."

            "notes": "The key concept of this Pioneer 1 vs 1 deck is to quickly fill the graveyard with creatures using cards like Stitcher's Supplier, Satyr Wayfinder, and Grisly Salvage, in order to trigger powerful graveyard recursion cards like Haunted Dead, Prized Amalgam, and Scrapheap Scrounger. By utilizing these graveyard synergies, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a steady stream of aggressive creatures and efficiently close out games with big finishers like Decimator of the Provinces. The deck's combination of graveyard manipulation and aggressive creatures makes it a formidable Aggro deck in the Pioneer format."

The deck also includes a sideboard with Fae of Wishes to access additional answers as needed, allowing for adaptable gameplay depending on the matchup. The combination of powerful planeswalkers and control spells make this deck a formidable opponent in Pioneer 1 vs 1 matchups."
