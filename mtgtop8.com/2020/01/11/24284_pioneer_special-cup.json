Protection spells like Gods Willing and Boros Charm help protect key creatures and finish games with direct damage. The deck's strategy revolves around aggressive early plays and maintaining pressure throughout the game."

Cards like Ensoul Artifact, Skilled Animator, and Ghostfire Blade can turn small artifacts into powerful threats, while Shrapnel Blast provides additional reach to close out games. The inclusion of counter spells like Stubborn Denial helps protect your key threats, while cards like The Royal Scions and Emry, Lurker of the Loch provide additional card advantage and utility. Overall, the deck aims to be aggressive and fast-paced, overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of artifact creatures."

This leads to powerful plays like bringing back Arclight Phoenix from the graveyard and flipping Thing in the Ice to close out the game quickly. The deck also includes card draw spells like Treasure Cruise and Strategic Planning to ensure a steady stream of resources."
