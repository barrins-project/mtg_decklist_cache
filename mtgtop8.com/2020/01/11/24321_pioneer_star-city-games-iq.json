Torbran, Thane of Red Fell boosts all red sources of damage, while Embercleave provides a powerful equipment option for finishing off opponents. The deck aims to apply pressure from the start and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

These threats can control the board and pressure opponents while also providing strong late-game finishers. The deck aims to accelerate mana production early on with cards like Elvish Mystic and Arboreal Grazer, then use the extra resources to overwhelm opponents with large creatures and powerful spells. This strategy allows the deck to dominate the mid-to-late game and secure victory through overwhelming resources and threats."
