Cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Venser, Shaper Savant provide additional disruption and tempo advantage, allowing the player to out-grind opponents and maintain board presence. The deck utilizes efficient removal spells like Path to Exile and Deputy of Detention to deal with threats, while also having access to counterspells like Force of Negation for protection. The mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility."

Additionally, the inclusion of Field of the Dead provides an alternate win condition by creating a zombie army to overwhelm your opponent. Ultimately, the goal is to secure a quick and decisive victory through efficient land ramp and damaging combos."
