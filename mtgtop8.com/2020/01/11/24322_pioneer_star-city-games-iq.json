The key strategy is to use low-cost creatures like Gutterbones, Knight of the Ebon Legion, and Bloodsoaked Champion to apply pressure early on, while using removal like Fatal Push and Murderous Rider to keep the opponent's creatures at bay. The deck also includes cards like Thoughtseize and Rankle, Master of Pranks to disrupt the opponent's game plan and gain advantage. The goal is to maintain a strong board presence and end the game swiftly."
