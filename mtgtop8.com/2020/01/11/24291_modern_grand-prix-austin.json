By using cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer and Oko, Thief of Crowns, the deck can generate value and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a mix of counter spells like Cryptic Command and Metallic Rebuke, along with creature removal like Ice-Fang Coatl, this deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent until it can secure a win condition. The mana base is optimized for consistency and includes powerful lands like Mystic Sanctuary for added utility."
