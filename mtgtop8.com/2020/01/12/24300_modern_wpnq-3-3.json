Noxious Revival allows for recursion of key combo pieces, while Aria of Flame can close out the game once the combo is online. Snapcaster Mage provides additional value by flashing back useful spells. The mana base allows for consistent casting of spells and fetching necessary dual lands. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can combo off and win."
