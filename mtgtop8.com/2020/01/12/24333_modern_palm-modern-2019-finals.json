It utilizes cards like Aether Vial and Collected Company to cheat creatures into play, while also utilizing synergy between cards like Phantasmal Image, Charming Prince, and Mirror Image to create a strong board presence. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Plaguecrafter to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base is built around ensuring a consistent flow of colored mana to smoothly cast the diverse array of creatures in the deck."
