The deck also features disruptive elements like Karn, the Great Creator and Oblivion Stone to control the game until the big finish with devastating creatures like Wurmcoil Engine and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The deck aims to control the game early on, ramp up its mana, and overwhelm the opponent with unstoppable threats in the late game."
