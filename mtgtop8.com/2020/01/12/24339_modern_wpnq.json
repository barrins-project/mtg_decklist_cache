The deck features a variety of creatures, such as Vault Skirge, Signal Pest, Ornithopter, Memnite, Gingerbrute, and Arcbound Ravager, that can quickly become formidable threats with the help of Master of Etherium. The deck utilizes lands like Inkmoth Nexus, Blinkmoth Nexus, and Darksteel Citadel to enable powerful synergies with artifacts."
