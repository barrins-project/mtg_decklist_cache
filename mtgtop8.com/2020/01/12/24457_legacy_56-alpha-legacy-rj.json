Teferi, Time Raveler is included as a disruptive element against opposing spells, and Monastery Mentor provides an alternate win condition. The deck runs a mix of lands to ensure smooth mana development and consistency in executing the combo."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Force of Will and Swords to Plowshares while setting up powerful plays with Brainstorm and Ponder. Additionally, the deck can generate value with cards like Council's Judgment and Mystic Sanctuary, while also having a win condition in Entreat the Angels. The overall strategy revolves around outlasting opponents and grinding out victories."
