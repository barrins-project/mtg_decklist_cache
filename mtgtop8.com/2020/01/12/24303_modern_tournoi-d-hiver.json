The goal is to ramp up quickly with Urza lands and Eldrazi Temple to cast large threats like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher. The deck also has some flexibility with cards like Walking Ballista and Ugin, the Ineffable to deal with different situations. It aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and disruptive plays to secure a quick victory."
