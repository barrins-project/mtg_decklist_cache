The deck focuses on card advantage with cards like Mulldrifter, Mnemonic Wall, and Forbidden Alchemy, while also utilizing cards like Stonehorn Dignitary and Moment's Peace to stall the game. Ghostly Flicker and Ephemerate provide additional value by blinking creatures with powerful enter-the-battlefield effects. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through efficient control and card advantage."
