The deck also utilizes planeswalkers like Narset, Parter of Veils and Jace, Architect of Thought for additional card advantage. With the ability to control the board state and limit the opponent's options, this deck aims to stall the game until it can win with its powerful planeswalkers or through incremental advantage gained over time."
