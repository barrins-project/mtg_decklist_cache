            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly equipping Colossus Hammer onto creatures like Cerulean Drake or Apostle of Purifying Light to create powerful threats early in the game. Using cards like Sigarda's Aid and Open the Armory to search for and attach the hammer efficiently. Protection spells like Gods Willing ensure the equipped creature is difficult to deal with. Scheming Symmetry allows for tutoring key pieces while Merfolk Secretkeeper provides early defense and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful aggro threats equipped with Colossus Hammer."
