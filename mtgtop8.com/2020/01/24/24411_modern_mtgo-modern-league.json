Cards like Desperate Ritual and Pyretic Ritual provide additional mana while spells like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand help dig for combo pieces. Gifts Ungiven and Past in Flames allow for recursion and a toolbox approach to finding the win condition, whether it's Empty the Warrens, Grapeshot, or Aria of Flame. The deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent with a massive storm count and finish the game in a single turn."

The deck is looking to control the board with powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Wrenn and Six, while also applying pressure with creatures like Tarmogoyf and Bloodbraid Elf. The deck also utilizes efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Assassin's Trophy to keep the opponent on the back foot. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of proactive threats and disruptive spells."
