The mana base is streamlined with fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistent casting of spells. Overall, this deck aims to apply pressure from the start and maintain control throughout the game."

By utilizing fast mana sources like Lotus Petal and Simian Spirit Guide, along with disruption cards like Daze and Force of Will, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big threats early in the game. The goal is to win the game through a combination of powerful creatures and efficient combo pieces before the opponent has a chance to react effectively."
