The deck also includes disruptive elements like Liliana of the Veil and Collective Brutality, along with efficient removal like Lightning Bolt and Lightning Axe. By leveraging these cards together with the mana acceleration provided by cards like Simian Spirit Guide, the deck aims to disrupt opponents' strategies while presenting a fast and aggressive clock to close out games."
