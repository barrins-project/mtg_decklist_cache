The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and efficiently answer threats with cards like Force of Will, Swords to Plowshares, and Terminus. It also has some additional card advantage engines like Snapcaster Mage and Predict. By leveraging a combination of control elements and potent finishers, this deck seeks to outmaneuver opponents and ultimately secure victory through incremental advantage."
