            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly assemble the Dark Depths combo by using cards like Thespian's Stage, Vampire Hexmage, and Crop Rotation. The deck includes various ways to protect the combo, such as Pithing Needle and Not of This World. It also includes disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck focuses on efficiently tutoring for the combo pieces and protecting them, while also having a backup plan with Elvish Reclaimer."
