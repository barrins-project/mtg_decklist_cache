            "notes": "The key idea of this deck is to maintain control of the game through counter spells, removal, and card draw. It aims to control the board with cards like Brazen Borrower and Storm's Wrath while ramping up mana with Growth Spiral and Wilderness Reclamation. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Niv-Mizzet, Parun and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. Thassa's Intervention and Expansion / Explosion provide additional control and card advantage. Overall, the deck focuses on out-valuing and out-lasting the opponent in order to secure victory."
