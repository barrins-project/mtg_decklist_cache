            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly deal damage to your opponent by playing low-cost, high-impact burn spells and aggressive creatures. By utilizing cards like Chain Lightning, Lava Spike, and Lightning Bolt, along with efficient creatures like Ghitu Lavarunner and Thermo-Alchemist, the deck aims to pressure the opponent's life total early on and finish them off with direct burn spells like Fireblast. The inclusion of Searing Blaze adds additional removal and damage potential, while Curse of the Pierced Heart provides consistent damage over time. Overall, the deck is built to overwhelm opponents with constant aggression and burn damage."
