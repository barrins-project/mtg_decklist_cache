By consistently sacrificing and bringing back creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with damage and board presence. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion enhances the deck's aggressive strategy by providing a significant boost to odd-costed damage. Overall, the key concept of this Rakdos Aggro deck is to maintain pressure on the opponent while utilizing sacrifice synergies to maintain a strong board presence."
