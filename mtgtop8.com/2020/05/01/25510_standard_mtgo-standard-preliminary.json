The deck aims to control the game by countering key spells, removing threats from the board, and generating card advantage through cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Tamiyo, Collector of Tales. The deck also aims to ramp up its mana with cards like Growth Spiral and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to quickly reach its powerful late-game threats like Shark Typhoon and Agent of Treachery."
