The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures and take advantage of Winota's ability to create a board state that is difficult to deal with. With a mix of aggressive creatures and control elements, this deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain that pressure throughout the game. The key strategy is to maximize the effectiveness of Winota's trigger and snowball the advantage into a win."
