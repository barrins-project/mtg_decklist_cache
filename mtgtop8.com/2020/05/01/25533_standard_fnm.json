By utilizing the companion Zirda, the Dawnwaker, the deck aims to reduce the cost of cycling abilities and maximize its efficiency. With a combination of cheap cycling creatures like Flourishing Fox and powerful finishers like Zenith Flare, the deck can deal a large amount of damage in a short amount of time. By maintaining a steady stream of cycling and utilizing combat tricks, it can apply pressure and close out games before the opponent can react effectively."
