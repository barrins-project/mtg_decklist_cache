By using cards like Spark Double and Fae of Wishes to copy or search for Gyruda, as well as Thassa to flicker it back to the battlefield, the deck aims to create a powerful combo that overwhelms the opponent with creatures and potentially wins the game with cards like End-Raze Forerunners or Thassa's Oracle. The deck also includes ramp cards like Growth Spiral and Paradise Druid to accelerate its game plan."
