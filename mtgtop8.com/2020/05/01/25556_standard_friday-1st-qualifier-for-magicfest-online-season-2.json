            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly getting creatures onto the battlefield and using Winota, Joiner of Forces to cheat out powerful creatures like Agent of Treachery. The deck includes cards that create tokens, like Legion Warboss and Raise the Alarm, as well as cards that can manipulate the top of the deck, like Charming Prince and Parcelbeast. The mana base is designed to support all the colors needed for the deck's spells and Winota's ability to trigger big value swings. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creature plays and powerful synergies."
