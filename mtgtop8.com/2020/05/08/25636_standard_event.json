The deck is built around creating a board presence with creatures like Flourishing Fox and Drannith Stinger while cycling through the deck to find key cards and maximize damage output. Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a companion to further enhance the deck's synergy and provide additional value. Overall, the deck aims to control the board early and close out the game with a powerful Zenith Flare finish."
