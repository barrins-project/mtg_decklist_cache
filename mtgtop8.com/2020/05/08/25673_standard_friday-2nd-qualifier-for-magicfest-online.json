The companion card, Lurrus of the Dream-Den, allows for additional recursion of key cards. By leveraging low-cost cycling cards and creatures with cycling abilities, the deck aims to constantly apply pressure and deal damage efficiently. With a mix of disruption and evasion, this cycling aggro deck aims to overwhelm opponents before they can stabilize."

It also utilizes the graveyard with cards like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Call of the Death-Dweller to maintain a menacing presence on the battlefield. The inclusion of Claim the Firstborn allows for additional disruption and stealing opponent's creatures to further assert dominance. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a relentless aggro strategy while maintaining resilience through sacrifice and recursion effects."
