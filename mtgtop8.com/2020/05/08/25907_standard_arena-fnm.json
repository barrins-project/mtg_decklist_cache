The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful board presence, using cards like Embercleave and Dire Tactics to push through damage and clear blockers. The inclusion of cards like Stormfist Crusader and Judith, the Scourge Diva also provides additional benefits for attacking, while cards like General Kudro of Drannith provide additional value and synergy with the deck's aggressive strategy. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and allow for consistent plays."
