By using cards like Brazen Borrower, Slitherwisp, and Sea-Dasher Octopus to apply pressure while also utilizing counter spells like Mystical Dispute and removal spells like Heartless Act, the deck aims to maintain control of the battlefield while dealing damage to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Ashiok's Erasure and Lochmere Serpent provides additional disruption and versatility to the deck's strategy, ultimately allowing it to outmaneuver and outpace the opponent."
