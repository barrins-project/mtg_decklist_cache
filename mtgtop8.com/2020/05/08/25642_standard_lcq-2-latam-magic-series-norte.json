By playing low-cost creatures like Fervent Champion and Scorch Spitter, the goal is to build a strong board presence early on and deal damage fast. Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell help to increase the damage output of your creatures, while cards like Embercleave provide additional burst damage. Experimental Frenzy allows for card advantage and Castle Embereth can boost your creatures for a final push to victory."
