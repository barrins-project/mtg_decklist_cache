The inclusion of cards like Zhur-Taa Goblin and Legion Warboss also allows for creating additional tokens and maintaining pressure on the opponent. Overall, the key strategy of this deck is to be fast, aggressive, and relentless in attacking the opponent."

The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures like Cavalier of Thorns and Agent of Treachery, while also utilizing the blink effect with Yorion, Sky Nomad and Thassa, Deep-Dwelling to continually generate value and maintain board control. The deck focuses on tempo and efficiency to outpace opponents and secure victory."
