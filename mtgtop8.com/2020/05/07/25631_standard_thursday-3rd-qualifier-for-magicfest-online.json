It generates value through cards like Agent of Treachery and Risen Reef, and finishes off opponents with explosive plays like Genesis Ultimatum and Omnath, Locus of the Roil. Thassa, Deep-Dwelling and Yorion, Sky Nomad provide additional value and recursion options. This deck seeks to overwhelm opponents with aggressive plays and powerful creature synergies in a Temur-colored Aggro shell."
