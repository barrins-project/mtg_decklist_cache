The goal is to control the game by countering opponent's spells using cards like Mystical Dispute and Negate, while also having the option to deal with threats using removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire. The deck also aims to draw cards and create threats with Shark Typhoon, ultimately leading to a win condition through powerful spells like Expansion / Explosion. The deck has a strong mix of control, ramp, and card advantage to dominate the game."
