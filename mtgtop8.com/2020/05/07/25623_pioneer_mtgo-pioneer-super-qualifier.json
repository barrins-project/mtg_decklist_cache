This deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence, while disrupting their game plan with Thoughtseize and Fatal Push. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds additional value by allowing for recursion of key cards. This deck relies on synergy between creatures like Hangarback Walker, Walking Ballista, and Steel Overseer, along with support from cards like Hardened Scales and Metallic Mimic to increase the power of the creatures."

The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of small creatures while protecting your own board with cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Elspeth Conquers Death. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion provides additional value through blinking creatures and permanents for advantage. Overall, the deck aims to establish an early board presence and maintain control of the game through efficient combat and disruptive tactics."
