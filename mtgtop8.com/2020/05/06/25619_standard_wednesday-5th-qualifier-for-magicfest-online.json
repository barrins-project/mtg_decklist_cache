The deck aims to slow down the opponent's aggression, ramp into powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Agent of Treachery, and close out the game with Shark Typhoon tokens or overwhelming card advantage. By effectively managing resources and dictating the pace of the game, Bant Control can outvalue opponents and secure victory."

Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by allowing you to recast your low-cost creatures from the graveyard. Overall, the key strategy is to cycle through your deck efficiently while dealing damage to your opponent as quickly as possible."
