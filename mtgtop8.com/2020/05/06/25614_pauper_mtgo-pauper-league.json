The deck focuses on using cards like Rancor, Ethereal Armor, and Armadillo Cloak to pump up a creature like Slippery Bogle or Gladecover Scout. The deck also includes cards like Gladecover Scout and Silhana Ledgewalker to make the enchanted creature harder to target. With efficient mana ramp and card draw, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a beefy, hexproof creature early in the game."
