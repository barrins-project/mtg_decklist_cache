By consistently triggering Winota's ability to put even more creatures into play, the deck aims to quickly close out games through aggressive combat strategies. Additionally, the deck includes a mix of disruptive and versatile creatures like Brazen Borrower and Agent of Treachery to further control the board and secure victories."
