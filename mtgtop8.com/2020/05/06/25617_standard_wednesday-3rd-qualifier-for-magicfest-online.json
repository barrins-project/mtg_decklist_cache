Nightpack Ambusher provides a threat while also generating wolf tokens, and Shark Typhoon can create a large flying creature or card advantage. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath can provide incremental card advantage and life gain. The deck aims to out-value opponents with powerful late-game plays and efficient answers to threats."
