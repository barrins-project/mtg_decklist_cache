            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly cycling through cards to build up a strong board state and deal damage to the opponent. The key strategy is to leverage the cycling mechanic to consistently draw cards and fuel powerful cycling payoffs like Zenith Flare. Creatures like Flourishing Fox and Valiant Rescuer provide threats that can quickly grow in power, while cards like Memory Leak disrupt the opponent's plans. By combining efficient cycling cards with aggressive creatures, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of attacks and burn spells."
