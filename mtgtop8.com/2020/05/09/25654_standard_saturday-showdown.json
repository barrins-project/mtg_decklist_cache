The deck aims to stabilize the game early on with cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Shatter the Sky, then transitions into a mid to late-game strategy of out-valuing opponents through Yorion, Sky Nomad flickering permanents, and generating threats with Shark Typhoon. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's triple-colored requirements and ensure consistency in casting powerful spells."
