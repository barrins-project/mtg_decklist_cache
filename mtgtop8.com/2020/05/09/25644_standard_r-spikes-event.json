With a mix of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells, this Dimir Aggro deck looks to outpace opponents and secure a win before they can stabilize."

It aims to stall the game until it can establish a strong board presence with cards like Dream Trawler and Agent of Treachery. The deck also includes Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion for additional value. By combining card advantage, disruption, and strong finishers, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent, ultimately winning through attrition and careful resource management."
