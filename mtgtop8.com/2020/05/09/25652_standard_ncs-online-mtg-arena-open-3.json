The deck focuses on aggressive play by cycling through cards to build up a strong board presence and efficiently finish off the opponent. Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a useful companion to provide additional recursion for key cards. With a mix of cycling cards, creatures, and removal spells, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and consistent damage output."
