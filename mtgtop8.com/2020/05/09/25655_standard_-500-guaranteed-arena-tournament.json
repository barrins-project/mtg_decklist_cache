By combining cards like Shark Typhoon and Zenith Flare with Wilderness Reclamation, the deck can create powerful synergies and overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and creatures. With a mix of control elements like Mystical Dispute and Neutralize, the deck can disrupt the opponent's plans while continuing to push the aggro strategy. The mana base is carefully constructed to allow for consistent access to the necessary colors for casting spells."
