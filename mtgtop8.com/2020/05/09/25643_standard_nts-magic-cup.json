By efficiently ramping into threats like Shark Typhoon and Nightpack Ambusher, the deck can put pressure on the opponent while also protecting its own threats with counterspells like Neutralize and Mystical Dispute. Sea-Dasher Octopus and Brazen Borrower offer additional evasion and tempo plays, allowing the deck to control the pace of the game and outmaneuver opponents. With a mix of counterspells, flash threats, and powerful finishers, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly and efficiently."
