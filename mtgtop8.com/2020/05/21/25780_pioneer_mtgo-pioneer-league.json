The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional recursion of creatures from the graveyard, making it difficult for opponents to stabilize against the constant stream of threats.

            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing aggressive creatures and powerful spells to quickly overwhelm opponents in one-on-one Pioneer matches. The key strategy involves utilizing the Companion card Zirda, the Dawnwaker to reduce the mana cost of activated abilities, allowing for more efficient plays. With a focus on creatures like Knight of the Ebon Legion, Pack Rat, and Scrapheap Scrounger, as well as removal spells like Fatal Push and Thoughtseize, this deck aims to maintain pressure on opponents while disrupting their game plan. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Gideon of the Trials and Karn, Scion of Urza adds additional versatility and power to the deck."
