The deck includes cards that help you dig through your library quickly, control the game with counterspells and removal, and ensure you have the right pieces at the right time. The inclusion of Yorion as a companion adds additional value by allowing you to flicker your permanents for extra value. Overall, the strategy revolves around assembling your combo pieces while disrupting your opponent's game plan."
