It also heavily relies on creatures that have abilities that trigger off of dealing damage or dying, allowing for constant pressure and card advantage. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for the deck to be more resilient and consistent in its aggressive strategy. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of removal, disruptive creatures, and powerful threats."
