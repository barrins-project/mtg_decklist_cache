It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures while also disrupting their game plan. The addition of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by blinking creatures and generating card advantage. The deck's mana base is designed to provide consistent access to white mana sources to enable its aggressive strategy."
