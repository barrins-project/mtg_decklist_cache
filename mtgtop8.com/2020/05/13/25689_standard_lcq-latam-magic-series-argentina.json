It aims to stall the game until it can establish a dominant position with powerful finishers like Dream Trawler and Shark Typhoon. The deck also utilizes key planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset, Parter of Veils to disrupt opponents' strategies and prevent them from gaining an advantage. By utilizing a mix of board wipes, targeted removal, and card draw, this deck aims to out-value and outlast opponents in a battle of attrition."
