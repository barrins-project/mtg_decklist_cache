            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly build up a strong board presence using creatures like Marauding Raptor and Stonecoil Serpent, while also utilizing Winota, Joiner of Forces to trigger powerful enter-the-battlefield abilities from creatures like Agent of Treachery. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and high-value creature effects, with additional support from cards like Charming Prince and Kenrith, the Returned King. Additionally, the inclusion of Umori, the Collector as a companion adds consistency to the deck by restricting the types of cards that can be included."
