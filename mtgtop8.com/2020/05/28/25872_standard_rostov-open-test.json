By utilizing the companion Lurrus of the Dream-Den, the deck ensures consistent access to key resources. With a mix of cycling cards, direct damage spells, and resilient creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a flurry of aggressive plays while maintaining card advantage and versatility. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Zenith Flare allows for potential burst damage to close out games quickly."
