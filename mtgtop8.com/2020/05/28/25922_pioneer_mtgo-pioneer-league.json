With Yorion as the companion, the deck can take advantage of extra cards and synergy with blink effects. The main win condition is to establish a dominant board presence with planeswalkers like Gideon and Teferi, while also disrupting the opponent's strategy with counterspells and stealing their threats with Agent of Treachery. The deck aims to control the game and outvalue the opponent until it can secure a victory."
