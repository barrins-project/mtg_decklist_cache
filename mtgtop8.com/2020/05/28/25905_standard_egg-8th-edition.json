The strategy is to establish a strong board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan until victory can be secured. The combination of Fires of Invention, powerful planeswalkers, and control elements make this deck a formidable force in Standard 1 vs 1."

The deck aims to generate card advantage through drawing and cycling cards, eventually winning the game through a large Explosion spell or by overwhelming the opponent with Shark tokens. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath is used to gain life and card advantage, helping to stabilize against aggressive decks while providing a powerful threat in the late game."
