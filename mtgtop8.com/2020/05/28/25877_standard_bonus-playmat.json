The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of small creatures that quickly grow in size and become difficult to deal with. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds additional value by allowing the player to recur important creatures and enchantments from the graveyard. This strategy aims to win the game through a combination of early aggression and resilience."
