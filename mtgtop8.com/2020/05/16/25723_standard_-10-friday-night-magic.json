By utilizing cards like Neutralize, Heartless Act, and Tyrant's Scorn, the deck aims to eliminate threats from the opponent while staying in control. Ashiok, Dream Render and Ashiok, Nightmare Muse provide additional disruption and card advantage. The deck also includes board wipes like Extinction Event and Cry of the Carnarium to deal with wide boards. Overall, this deck thrives on disrupting the opponent's strategy and slowly gaining an advantage through card advantage and removal."
