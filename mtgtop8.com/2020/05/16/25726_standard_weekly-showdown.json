            "notes": "This Sultai Control deck focuses on using a combination of removal spells, counterspells, card draw, and powerful threats to control the game. The deck features a companion in Yorion, Sky Nomad for additional value and flexibility. By combining a mix of board wipes like Extinction Event and Cry of the Carnarium with versatile removal like Assassin's Trophy and Tyrant's Scorn, along with powerful threats like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Hydroid Krasis, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents in a long game, ultimately overwhelming them with its card advantage and powerful creatures."
