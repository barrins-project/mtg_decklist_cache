            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing the synergy between creatures like Cauldron Familiar, Gutterbones, and Serrated Scorpion along with sacrifice outlets like Witch's Oven and Woe Strider to generate value and trigger abilities like Mayhem Devil's pings. By playing aggressively and utilizing cards like Claim the Firstborn to disrupt opponents' strategies, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of damage and efficient creature recursion. Obosh, the Preypiercer serves as a powerful companion that enhances the deck's ability to deal damage in odd increments."
