By using cards like Trail of Crumbs, Witch's Oven, and Priest of Forgotten Gods, the deck can continually generate advantage by sacrificing creatures and creating Food tokens. This deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by stealing their creatures with Claim the Firstborn and sacrificing them for profit. Korvold, Fae-Cursed King serves as a powerful finisher, gaining incremental advantage with each sacrifice made. Overall, the deck focuses on resource management and attrition to outlast opponents."

The goal is to constantly cycle through cards to trigger effects and build up a powerful board presence, while also utilizing the Zenith Flare as a potential finisher. The deck has a low mana curve with a mix of creatures and spells that can quickly overwhelm opponents with fast damage output and efficient cycling abilities. Additionally, Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a powerful companion to support the deck's strategy."
