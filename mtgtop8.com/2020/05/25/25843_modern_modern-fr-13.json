The main strategy revolves around aggressive plays with efficient threats like Tarmogoyf and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger, while disrupting opponents with hand disruption spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize. The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to control the board, as well as ways to generate card advantage through cards like Mishra's Bauble and Dark Confidant. The mana base is built to support the color requirements of the spells while also providing utility lands like Wrenn and Six and Raging Ravine."
