Additionally, powerful threats like Dream Trawler and Elspeth Conquers Death provide win conditions while maintaining control over the game. Overall, the deck aims to grind out the opponent and control the game until victory."

It aims to control the board using cards like Witch's Oven and Priest of Forgotten Gods, while also utilizing cards like Claim the Firstborn and Act of Treason to steal opponent's creatures for additional damage. The deck also includes Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion to provide additional value by recurring low-cost permanent cards from the graveyard. With a mix of sacrifice effects, steal effects, and aggressive creatures, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly."
