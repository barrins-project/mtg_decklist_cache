The main win condition is assembling the combo of Scapeshift and Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle to deal lethal damage to the opponent in one turn. The deck also utilizes the powerful card advantage of Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and recurring value from Mystic Sanctuary. The addition of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional card advantage and flexibility in the late game."

The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with unblockable, heavily buffed creatures before they can mount a defense. With Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion, this deck can constantly recur auras to maintain pressure and outvalue the opponent. The mana base is optimized for fast, consistent creature deployment and aura casting."
