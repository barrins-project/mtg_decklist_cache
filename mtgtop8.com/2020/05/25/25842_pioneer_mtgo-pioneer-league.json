Collected Company allows you to dig for more creatures and maintain pressure on your opponent. The inclusion of Jegantha as a companion adds extra flexibility to your mana base. The deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent with a fast and powerful aggro strategy."

The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion provides additional value and flexibility to the deck. The deck's mana base is carefully crafted to ensure consistency and the ability to cast its spells efficiently."
