The deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana, the Last Hope to control the board. Additionally, the deck includes powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to provide pressure and close out the game. The mana base is built around utilizing snow lands and Arcum's Astrolabe to fix mana and enable the powerful snow synergy cards like Ice-Fang Coatl and Dead of Winter."
