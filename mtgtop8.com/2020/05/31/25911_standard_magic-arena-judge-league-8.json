Fires of Invention allows the player to play spells without paying their mana cost, while Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast and Agent of Treachery provide ways to cheat out powerful creatures. Yorion, Sky Nomad acts as an additional card advantage engine with its ability to blink permanents for value. The deck aims to control the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful creatures and planeswalkers."
