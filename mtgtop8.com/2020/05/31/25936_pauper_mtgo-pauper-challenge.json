The deck also includes efficient card draw and filtering with Brainstorm and Preordain, as well as a strong late-game engine with Mystic Sanctuary and Ninja of the Deep Hours. Overall, the deck focuses on outvaluing and outlasting the opponent through control."

By efficiently utilizing mana and taking advantage of synergies between creatures like Nettle Sentinel and Quirion Ranger, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a strong defense. The key strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent, forcing them to constantly respond to threats while steadily reducing their life total."
