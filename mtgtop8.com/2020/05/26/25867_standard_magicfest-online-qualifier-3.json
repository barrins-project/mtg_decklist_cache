It heavily relies on cards like Teferi, Time Raveler, Narset, Parter of Veils, and Elspeth Conquers Death to maintain board control and deny the opponent resources. The addition of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for powerful late-game plays with its ability to flicker multiple permanents. The deck also includes counterspells like Absorb and Mystical Dispute to protect its key cards, while cards like Shark Typhoon provide a win condition and card advantage."
