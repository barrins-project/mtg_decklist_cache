The key strategy is to constantly cycle through cards to trigger abilities that create tokens or deal damage, while also controlling the opponent's hand with cards like Memory Leak. Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a powerful companion that allows for additional card recursion to ensure a consistent flow of threats and answers. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures while burning them down with Zenith Flare."
