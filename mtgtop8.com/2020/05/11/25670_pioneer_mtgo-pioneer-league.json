The deck aims to control the board with cards like Shock, Lightning Strike, and Boros Charm, while also utilizing cards like Light Up the Stage and Wizard's Lightning for card advantage. With a low mana curve, the aggressive creatures like Soul-Scar Mage, Monastery Swiftspear, and Viashino Pyromancer can quickly deal damage to the opponent. Eidolon of the Great Revel punishes opponents for playing spells, helping to maintain pressure and control the tempo of the game."
