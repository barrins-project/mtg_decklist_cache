The deck includes cards that synergize well with sacrificing creatures for value, such as Witch's Oven and Cauldron Familiar. Other cards like Mayhem Devil and Bastion of Remembrance provide additional damage and value when creatures are sacrificed. The companion Obosh, the Preypiercer also enhances the deck's overall damage output. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly with a combination of creature aggression and sacrificing for value."
