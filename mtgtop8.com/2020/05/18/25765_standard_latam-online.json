The deck focuses on fast, low-cost creatures like Scorch Spitter and Fervent Champion, supported by powerful finishers like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Embercleave. The deck also includes efficient removal in the form of Shock and Bonecrusher Giant to clear the way for your creatures. The goal is to maintain pressure on the opponent and end the game quickly before they have a chance to stabilize."
