By playing efficient creatures like Bomat Courier, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Monastery Swiftspear, along with burn spells like Shock and Wild Slash, the goal is to deal damage as quickly as possible and control the game with cards like Rampaging Ferocidon and Soul-Scar Mage. The deck also utilizes Castle Embereth and Ramunap Ruins for extra damage and Mutavault for additional creature pressure. With Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion, the strategy is further enhanced by rewarding odd-costed cards for maximum damage output."
