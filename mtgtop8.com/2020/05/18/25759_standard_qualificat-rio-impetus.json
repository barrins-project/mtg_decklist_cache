The key strategy involves using cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Teferi, Time Raveler to disrupt opponents while setting up a strong board presence with cards like Omen of the Sea and Shark Typhoon. Removal spells like Kaya's Wrath and Thought Erasure help control the board, while counterspells like Absorb and Dovin's Veto provide protection. The deck also includes card advantage engines like Chemister's Insight and Castle Vantress to outvalue opponents in the late game."
