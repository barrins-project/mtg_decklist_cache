By using Niv-Mizzet Reborn as a card advantage engine, along with efficient removal spells like Lightning Helix and Abrupt Decay, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Wrenn and Six provide additional disruption and consistency. The deck also utilizes the Bring to Light toolbox to access powerful cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Kaya's Guile."
