It also utilizes the companion Lurrus of the Dream-Den for additional value. By combining aggressive creatures like Drannith Healer and Drannith Stinger with cycling cards like Startling Development and Boon of the Wish-Giver, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly. Additionally, cards like Valiant Rescuer and Flourishing Fox provide resilience and additional threats. The key strategy is to cycle aggressively and efficiently to build up a strong board presence and finish the game with a powerful Zenith Flare."
