This allows the player to quickly reduce the opponent's life total while maintaining pressure through early aggression and direct damage spells. The inclusion of creatures like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Phoenix of Ash provide both resilience and additional damage potential when attacking or blocking. The strategy is to end the game as quickly as possible before the opponent can stabilize."
