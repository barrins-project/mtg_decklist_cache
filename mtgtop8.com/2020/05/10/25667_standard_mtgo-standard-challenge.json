The goal is to stall the game with cards like Shark Typhoon and Shatter the Sky, while generating card advantage with Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset, Parter of Veils. Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast can cheat out powerful creatures like Agent of Treachery, while Yorion, Sky Nomad provides additional value by blinking permanents for extra triggers. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents in the late game."
