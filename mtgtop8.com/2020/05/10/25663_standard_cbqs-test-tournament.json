            "notes": "This deck focuses on creating a quick and aggressive board presence by utilizing creatures with strong enter-the-battlefield effects, such as Risen Reef and Thunderkin Awakener. The key strategy is to ramp up mana using cards like Leafkin Druid and Winota, Joiner of Forces to quickly overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures. The deck also includes disruptive cards like Agent of Treachery to control the opponent's board. By efficiently utilizing the mana base and synergistic creature choices, this deck aims to establish dominance and control the game early on."
