The deck focuses on generating card advantage and tempo through cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset, Parter of Veils, while creating a board presence with cards like Archon of Sun's Grace and Shark Typhoon. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion adds consistency and resilience to the deck, allowing for additional value and flexibility in longer games. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents through a combination of control and resource management."
