The key strategy is to deploy creatures like Soul-Scar Mage, Monastery Swiftspear, and Abbot of Keral Keep early on, while using spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to deal damage and control the board. Lurrus of the Dream-Den acts as a companion to provide additional value by recurring low-cost permanents from the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to be efficient and aggressive to close out games swiftly."

The deck also focuses on disruption and control elements with cards like Drown in the Loch, Surgical Extraction, and Fatal Push. By combining mill with removal and counter spells, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and win through decking them out. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion provides additional value and recursion for key combo pieces."
