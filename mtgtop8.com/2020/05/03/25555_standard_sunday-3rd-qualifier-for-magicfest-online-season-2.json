By sacrificing creatures like Cauldron Familiar and Serrated Scorpion with cards such as Witch's Oven and Priest of Forgotten Gods, the deck can trigger abilities like Cruel Celebrant's and Dreadhorde Butcher's multiple times. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of threats and drain effects, while also utilizing cards like Dire Tactics and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
