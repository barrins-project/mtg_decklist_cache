By constantly cycling through your deck, you can control the pace of the game and overwhelm your opponent with a combination of small, evasive creatures and powerful cycling payoffs. The goal is to quickly build up a board presence and finish off your opponent with a large Zenith Flare or an army of tokens. The deck is fast, aggressive, and rewards careful planning and sequencing of your cards."
