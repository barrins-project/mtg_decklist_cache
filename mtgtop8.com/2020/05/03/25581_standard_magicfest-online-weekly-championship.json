The deck also leverages card advantage with Narset, Parter of Veils and Omen of the Sea, while generating evasive threats with Shark Typhoon. Yorion, Sky Nomad serves as a companion to provide additional value with its flicker ability. The deck aims to grind out the opponent and outvalue them in the late game."

Fires of Invention allows for explosive plays, while Scorching Dragonfire provides removal options. The inclusion of Gemrazer helps deal with problematic artifacts and enchantments. The deck aims to apply pressure early in the game and maintain that pressure to close out the game swiftly. The consistency of ramp with Arboreal Grazer and mana fixing with Fabled Passage and Ketria Triome ensures the deck can execute its aggressive game plan effectively."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Mystical Dispute and removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire, while also generating card advantage with cards like Growth Spiral and Expansion / Explosion. The inclusion of Wilderness Reclamation allows for explosive turns where multiple spells can be played in a single turn, overwhelming the opponent and securing victory."
