            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the flow of the game through efficient use of counter spells and removal, while generating value through card draw and mana ramp. Cards like Wilderness Reclamation and Growth Spiral help accelerate mana production, while Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides card advantage and life gain. Shark Typhoon can create a threat while protecting against counterspells. The deck aims to establish board control and overwhelm opponents with powerful spells like Expansion / Explosion once the board is stable."
