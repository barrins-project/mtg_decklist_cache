The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while ramping up to play big threats like Agent of Treachery and Shark Typhoon. The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value through blinking permanents for card advantage and board control. With a mix of control elements and powerful late-game threats, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents in a slower, more grindy matchup."

With the addition of cards like Obosh, the Preypiercer to increase damage output, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of aggressive plays and incremental value. The goal is to maintain pressure and tempo while utilizing sacrifice synergies to control the board and close out the game quickly."
