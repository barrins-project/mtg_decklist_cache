With the companion card Obosh, the Preypiercer providing an extra source of damage, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and efficient creatures like Fervent Champion, Anax, Hardened in the Forge, and Bonecrusher Giant. Utilizing cards like Light Up the Stage and Heraldic Banner for card advantage and boosting creature power, the deck aims to quickly close out games with direct damage and creature attacks."
