            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by disrupting the opponent with cards like Pillage, Lightning Bolt, and Magus of the Moon while ramping up mana with cards like Utopia Sprawl and Arbor Elf. The deck also includes powerful threats like Glorybringer and Kitchen Finks to pressure the opponent. Klothys, God of Destiny provides additional value and disruption, while Obosh, the Preypiercer serves as a companion to enhance the deck's damage output. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and close out the game with its powerful threats."
