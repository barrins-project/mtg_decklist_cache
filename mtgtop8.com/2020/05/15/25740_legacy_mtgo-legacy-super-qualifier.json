The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional card recursion and repeatability, making the deck more resilient in longer games. Additionally, the deck's mana base is optimized for consistency and enables the main game plan of disruption and resource denial."

The deck aims to apply early pressure with threats like Delver of Secrets and Dreadhorde Arcanist, while utilizing cards like Brainstorm and Ponder to dig for answers and card advantage. Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by allowing the player to recur low-cost permanents from the graveyard, further enhancing the deck's aggressive game plan."
