The key strategy is to ramp up mana quickly with Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Idyllic Grange, while utilizing cards like Walking Ballista and Heliod, Sun-Crowned to deal damage and gain life. The deck also includes resilient threats like Gideon of the Trials and Elspeth Conquers Death to control the board. Overall, the deck aims to be aggressive and disruptive, applying pressure from the early game onwards."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game through counterspells, removal spells, and card draw, with a secondary win condition in Zenith Flare. It utilizes Zirda, the Dawnwaker as a companion to reduce the cost of activating abilities. The deck includes cards like Shark Typhoon for token generation, Cast Out for removal, and Flourishing Fox for cycling synergy. It aims to outvalue opponents with card advantage and efficient answers while maintaining a threat presence with Zenith Flare."
