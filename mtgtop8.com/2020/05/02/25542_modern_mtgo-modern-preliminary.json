The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds further versatility to the deck, allowing for recurring key creatures or artifacts.

The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze help control the opponent's board while maintaining tempo. The companion Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by allowing you to recur low-cost permanents from your graveyard. The overall strategy is to outrace the opponent and win before they can stabilize."
