The cards in the deck are chosen to enable this strategy, with a mix of cycling cards, low-cost creatures, and burn spells to finish off the opponent. The deck also uses Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion to provide additional value by allowing you to replay creatures from your graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to be aggressive and put pressure on the opponent early in the game."
