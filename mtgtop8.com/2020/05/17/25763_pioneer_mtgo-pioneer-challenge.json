The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows the deck to generate additional value by blinking permanents for extra triggers. The end game plan involves stabilizing the board and overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Emrakul, the Promised End."

The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for recursion of key pieces of the deck. The combination of low-cost creatures like Tenth District Legionnaire and Soul-Scar Mage with combat tricks like Gods Willing and Defiant Strike allows for explosive turns and overwhelming opponents before they can stabilize. The mana base is optimized for consistent access to both white and red sources."
