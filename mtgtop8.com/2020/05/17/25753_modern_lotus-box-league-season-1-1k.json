Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a companion, providing additional value by allowing you to cast cheap permanents from your graveyard."

Additionally, the inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for recursion of key combo pieces. The deck also includes interaction with cards like Giver of Runes and Spellskite to protect its combo pieces from removal."

The deck also runs cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Wrenn and Six to control the game and protect the combo pieces. The mana base is designed to efficiently support the combo while also providing flexibility to adapt to the opponent's strategy. The archetype utilizes a variety of spells and creatures to maintain consistency and resilience in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."
