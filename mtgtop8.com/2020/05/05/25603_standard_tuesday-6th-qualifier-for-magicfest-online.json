By using cards with cycling abilities like Boon of the Wish-Giver and Startling Development, the deck can draw through the deck quickly to find key cards like Zenith Flare. Zenith Flare deals damage based on the number of cards in the graveyard, making cycling even more effective. The deck also includes creatures like Valiant Rescuer and Drannith Stinger to provide additional damage and pressure. Overall, the deck focuses on aggressive cycling strategies to overwhelm opponents."
