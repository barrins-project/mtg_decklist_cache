            "notes": "The main focus of this Aggro - Red Deck Wins archetype is to quickly and aggressively deal damage to the opponent. By using low-cost creatures like Tin Street Dodger and Scorch Spitter, along with powerful threats like Torbran and Embercleave, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. Card advantage is generated through spells like Light Up the Stage and Robber of the Rich, while Castle Embereth and Anax, Hardened in the Forge provide additional ways to win the game through damage output. The deck is designed to be fast, efficient, and relentless in its pursuit of victory."
