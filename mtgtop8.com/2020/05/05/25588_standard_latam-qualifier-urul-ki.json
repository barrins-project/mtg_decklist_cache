The deck also aims to create a value engine with cards like Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast and Elspeth Conquers Death. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and control the game until victory."

The goal is to outvalue the opponent by constantly disrupting their game plan and eventually overpowering them with powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Agent of Treachery. The key strategy is to outlast the opponent by controlling the board and maintaining a strong card advantage to eventually take over the game."
