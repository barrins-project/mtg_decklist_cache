Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides card advantage and life gain, while Shark Typhoon creates threats and can be cycled for value. The deck also includes removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire and versatile spells like Expansion / Explosion for flexibility. The mana base supports the three color combination of Temur, allowing for consistent and powerful plays throughout the game."
