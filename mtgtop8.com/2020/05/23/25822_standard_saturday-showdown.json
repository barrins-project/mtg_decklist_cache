By utilizing cheap, efficient creatures along with powerful enchantments like All That Glitters, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and protect its key creatures with protection spells like Gods Willing and Karametra's Blessing. The combination of evasion, protection, and recursion makes this deck difficult to deal with for many opponents."
