By utilizing combo pieces like Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast and Teferi, Time Raveler, the deck aims to generate card advantage and constantly disrupt the opponent's strategy. With a focus on generating value and controlling the battlefield, the deck also incorporates cards like Shark Typhoon and Agent of Treachery for additional win conditions and removal options. Additionally, the inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad allows for additional flexibility and synergy with the deck's strategy."
