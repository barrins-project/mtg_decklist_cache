The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional value by flickering permanents for extra triggers. The deck aims to stall the game until it can stabilize and win through cards like Dream Trawler or Shark Typhoon, while preventing the opponent from executing their own strategy effectively."

The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for continuous value by recurring cheap creatures from the graveyard. Overall, this deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game to secure a quick victory."
