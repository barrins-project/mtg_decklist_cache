The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den allows for recursion of key creatures, providing flexibility and resilience in longer games. Overall, this deck looks to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient threats backed up with versatile removal options."

The inclusion of protection spells like Gods Willing and Karametra's Blessing help keep key creatures on the battlefield, ensuring a steady stream of pressure on the opponent."

It aims to stall the game, establish a strong board presence, and eventually overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Agent of Treachery and Shark Typhoon. Additionally, the deck includes Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion for extra value and synergy with its enter-the-battlefield abilities. The mana base is carefully crafted to ensure consistent access to all necessary colors of mana for optimal card selection and activation."
