The deck also generates card advantage with Narset, Parter of Veils and Omen of the Sea, while creating a win condition with Shark Typhoon. Yorion, Sky Nomad acts as a companion, providing additional value by blinking permanents for extra effects. The mana base allows for consistency in casting spells of all colors."
