By attacking with multiple creatures, the deck aims to trigger Winota's ability, allowing the player to put Agent of Treachery or other impactful creatures onto the battlefield for free. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Deputy of Detention and Brazen Borrower to control the opponent's board while maintaining pressure with aggressive creatures like Legion Warboss and Haktos the Unscarred. The deck utilizes a variety of colors to support its aggressive game plan."
