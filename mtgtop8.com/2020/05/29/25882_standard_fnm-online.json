The use of the companion Obosh, the Preypiercer amplifies the damage output, while cards like Phoenix of Ash, Bonecrusher Giant, and Anax, Hardened in the Forge provide strong board presence. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy, utilizing cards like Tin Street Dodger, Scorch Spitter, and Fervent Champion to apply pressure and close out the game swiftly."
