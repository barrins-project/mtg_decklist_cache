It aims to generate card advantage and outvalue the opponent by utilizing powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset, Parter of Veils. The deck also uses other card advantage engines like Shark Typhoon and Elspeth Conquers Death to maintain control of the game. With a high land count and Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion, the deck has a strong late-game presence and can overwhelm opponents with its powerful threats and card advantage."
