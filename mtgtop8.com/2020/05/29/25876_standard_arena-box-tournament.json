The key strategy is to ramp up mana quickly with Fires of Invention and Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast, allowing you to cast big spells like Agent of Treachery and Elspeth Conquers Death. The addition of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion adds additional value by flickering permanents for extra card advantage and board presence."
