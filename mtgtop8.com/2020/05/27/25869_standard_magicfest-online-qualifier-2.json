By utilizing the Companion ability of Umori, the Collector, the deck ensures consistency in creature types and encourages aggressive plays. The combination of flying, trample, and other abilities from creatures like Gemrazer and End-Raze Forerunners allows for quick victories. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the aggressive game plan, ensuring a smooth curve of creatures and mutations."
