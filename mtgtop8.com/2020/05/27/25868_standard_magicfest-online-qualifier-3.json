The deck also aims to generate card advantage with cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Shark Typhoon, while also having the option to finish off the opponent with a large Explosion or Shark token. The deck has a good mix of reactive and proactive elements, allowing it to adapt to various matchups and playstyles."
