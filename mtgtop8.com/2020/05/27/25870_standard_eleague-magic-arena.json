Winota's ability triggers upon attacking, allowing the player to put powerful creatures like Agent of Treachery onto the battlefield for free. The deck also includes cards like Legion Warboss and Hanged Executioner to ensure continuous aggression, while Kenrith, the Returned King provides additional utility. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful board presence, leading to a swift victory."
