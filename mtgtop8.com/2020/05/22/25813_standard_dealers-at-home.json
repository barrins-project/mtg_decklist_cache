The inclusion of Claim the Firstborn allows for stealing key creatures from the opponent, while cards like Mayhem Devil and Priest of Forgotten Gods provide additional value from sacrificing creatures. Overall, the deck seeks to outvalue and outlast opponents through continuous resource generation and disruption."
