The key strategy is to constantly pressure the opponent with a steady stream of threats while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion provides additional value by allowing you to cast cards from your graveyard. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm your opponent with a relentless assault of creatures and drain effects."
