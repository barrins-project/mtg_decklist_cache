By utilizing the extra damage boost from Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. The deck includes several low-cost creatures like Fervent Champion and Scorch Spitter to quickly establish a board presence, supported by direct damage spells like Shock and Slaying Fire to clear the way for attacks. The addition of Chandra, Acolyte of Flame and Castle Embereth provides extra value and pump effects to further push for quick wins."
