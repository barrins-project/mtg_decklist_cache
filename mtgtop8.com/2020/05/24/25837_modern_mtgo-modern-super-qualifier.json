With the right sequence of plays, this deck can overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of land drops and titan searches."

Utilizing a combination of counterspells, removal, and card draw, the deck aims to stabilize the board while generating incremental value. The inclusion of powerful cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provide additional card advantage and win conditions. Ultimately, the deck aims to grind out the opponent and win through incremental advantages rather than overwhelming aggression."
