It achieves this by using Wilderness Reclamation to generate additional mana, counterspells like Mystical Dispute and Neutralize to stop key spells, and removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire and Storm's Wrath to deal with threats. The deck also has card draw with Growth Spiral and Chemister's Insight, and can close out the game with Shark Typhoon and Expansion / Explosion. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides card advantage and life gain to ensure longevity in the game."
