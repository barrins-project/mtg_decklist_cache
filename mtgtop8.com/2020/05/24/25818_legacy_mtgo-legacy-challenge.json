By using cards like Force of Will, Swords to Plowshares, and Teferi, Time Raveler, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also generating card advantage through cards like Baleful Strix and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by blinking important permanents for additional card advantage and tempo advantage. The mana base is optimized for casting spells of multiple colors efficiently."
