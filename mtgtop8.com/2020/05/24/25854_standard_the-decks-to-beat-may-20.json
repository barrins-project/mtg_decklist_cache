            "notes": "This deck focuses on using sacrifice effects and creature theft to generate value and pressure the opponent quickly. By utilizing cards like Witch's Oven, Claim the Firstborn, and Priest of Forgotten Gods, the deck aims to control the board and drain the opponent's resources while applying pressure with aggressive creatures like Dreadhorde Butcher and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger. The deck also has a strong recursion theme with cards like Call of the Death-Dweller and Lurrus of the Dream-Den, allowing it to continually bring back threats and maintain a steady stream of aggression."
