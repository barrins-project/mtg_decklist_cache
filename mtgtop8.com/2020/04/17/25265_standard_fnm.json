By utilizing cards like Witch's Oven, Cauldron Familiar, and Mayhem Devil, the deck aims to chip away at the opponent's life total while generating incremental advantage. Cards like Tymaret Calls the Dead and Bastion of Remembrance provide additional value through tokens and life gain. The deck is designed to apply pressure early and maintain a steady stream of threats while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Claim the Firstborn and Priest of Forgotten Gods."
