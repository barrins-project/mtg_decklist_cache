By utilizing cards like Spark Double to copy Gyruda's ability, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creatures that have strong enter the battlefield effects. Cards like Thassa, Deep-Dwelling and Charming Prince help to further manipulate the board state and generate value. The goal is to establish a dominating board presence and win the game through consistent pressure and powerful creature synergies."
