By utilizing efficient creatures like Fervent Champion and Bonecrusher Giant, along with powerful enchantments like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, this deck aims to deal large amounts of damage early on in the game. The inclusion of cards like Light Up the Stage and Chandra, Acolyte of Flame provides card advantage and helps maintain tempo. Overall, this deck focuses on applying constant pressure and ending the game as quickly as possible."
