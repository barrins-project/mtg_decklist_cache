Using cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods, Mayhem Devil, and Witch's Oven, the deck seeks to disrupt the opponent's board while setting up its own win conditions. The deck also utilizes cards like Midnight Reaper and Trail of Crumbs to draw cards and find key pieces of the combo. Bolas's Citadel acts as a finisher, allowing the player to potentially win the game in one explosive turn."
