With cards like Runaway Steam-Kin and Fervent Champion, the deck aims to build a fast board presence and pressure the opponent early on. Support cards like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell help to maximize damage output, while cards like Light Up the Stage provide card advantage to keep the pressure on. The strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a relentless assault before they can stabilize."
