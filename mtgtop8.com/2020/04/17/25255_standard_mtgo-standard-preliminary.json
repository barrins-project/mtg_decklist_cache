            "notes": "This Rakdos Aggro deck focuses on utilizing sacrifice effects and small aggressive creatures to pressure the opponent and gain value from sacrificing creatures. Cards like Cauldron Familiar, Mayhem Devil, and Priest of Forgotten Gods help to generate incremental advantage while the deck chips away at the opponent's life total. The deck also includes cards like Claim the Firstborn and Woe Strider to disrupt the opponent's board and maintain aggressive pressure. Overall, the key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient creatures and sacrifice synergies."
