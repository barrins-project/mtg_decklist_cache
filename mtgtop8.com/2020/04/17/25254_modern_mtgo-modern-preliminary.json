By utilizing cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer and Emry, Lurker of the Loch, along with efficient removal spells like Galvanic Blast and Engineered Explosives, the deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Wrenn and Six for recurring value, and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath for additional resource generation, further solidify the control aspect of the deck."
