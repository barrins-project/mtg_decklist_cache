The key strategy is to establish a board presence early with efficient creatures like Fervent Champion and Robber of the Rich, while using direct damage spells like Shock and Light Up the Stage to finish off the opponent. Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Embercleave provide additional damage boosts to overwhelm the opponent quickly. The deck aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize and mount a defense."
