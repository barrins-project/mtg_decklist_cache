By utilizing cards like Bonecrusher Giant, Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, and Embercleave, the deck aims to deal massive damage to the opponent early in the game. Cards like Runaway Steam-Kin and Fervent Champion help generate extra mana and provide additional damage output. The inclusion of Castle Embereth and Tibalt, Rakish Instigator further supports the aggressive gameplay and ensures a fast-paced, high-pressure strategy."
