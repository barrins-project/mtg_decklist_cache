Dream Trawler serves as a win condition while also providing card draw. The deck aims to stall the game with board wipes like Shatter the Sky and efficient removal spells like Elspeth Conquers Death, while generating value through cards like Omen of the Sea. The combination of control elements and card advantage engines helps the deck to outlast and outvalue its opponents in a 1 vs 1 Standard format."
