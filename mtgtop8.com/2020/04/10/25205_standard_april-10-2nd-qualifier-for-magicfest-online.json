By playing powerful control cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset, Parter of Veils, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up its own win conditions. Using a combination of board wipes, counterspells, and card draw, the deck looks to stabilize the board and gain control of the game in the mid to late game, ultimately winning with powerful threats like Dream Trawler."
