The key strategy involves ramping up mana with Growth Spiral and Wilderness Reclamation to cast powerful spells like Shark Typhoon and Expansion / Explosion. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides additional card advantage and pressure on the opponent. The overall goal is to establish board control and outlast the opponent through efficient use of resources and interaction. Thassa's Intervention and Castle Vantress provide additional utility for the deck's game plan."
