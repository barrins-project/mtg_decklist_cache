The goal is to outvalue the opponent by countering their spells with Mystical Dispute, Neutralize, and Essence Scatter while drawing cards with Chemister's Insight and filtering with Opt. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Shark Typhoon to close out the game. The mana base supports the three-color Temur archetype, allowing for flexibility and consistency in casting spells. Ultimately, the strategy revolves around controlling the game and overwhelming the opponent with powerful spells and creatures."
