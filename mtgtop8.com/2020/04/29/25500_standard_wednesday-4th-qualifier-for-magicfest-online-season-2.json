By combining cards like Witch's Oven, Cauldron Familiar, and Priest of Forgotten Gods, along with the powerful Kroxa and Dreadhorde Butcher, the deck aims to consistently pressure the opponent while disrupting their game plan. Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as an additional tool for returning key creatures from the graveyard, creating a versatile game plan that can adapt to different situations. The deck's synergy and speed make it a formidable force in the Standard 1 vs 1 format."
