The combination of disruption, card draw, and efficient threats makes it difficult for the opponent to establish a board presence or execute their game plan effectively. The deck also benefits from the flexibility of Expansion / Explosion for additional control or finishing potential."

The deck aims to ramp up its mana with cards like Growth Spiral and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, while utilizing cards like Wilderness Reclamation and Shark Typhoon to generate value and pressure the opponent. The inclusion of versatile cards like Expansion / Explosion and Thassa's Intervention allows for flexibility in different game scenarios. The mana base is optimized for consistency and to support the three-color Temur combination."
