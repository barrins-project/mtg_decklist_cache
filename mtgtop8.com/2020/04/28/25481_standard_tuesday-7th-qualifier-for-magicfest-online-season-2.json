The deck also aims to ramp up its mana quickly with cards like Growth Spiral and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to play powerful threats like Agent of Treachery and Shark Typhoon. The deck also has strong card draw and recursion through cards like Omen of the Sea, Elspeth Conquers Death, and Tamiyo, Collector of Tales. Additionally, by utilizing the companion Yorion, Sky Nomad, the deck can further generate value by blinking permanents like Omen of the Sea and Elspeth Conquers Death."

By utilizing cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset, Parter of Veils, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating value through cards like Elspeth Conquers Death and Shark Typhoon. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by blinking permanents for extra ETB triggers. With a strong mana base and a mix of reactive and proactive spells, the deck seeks to outlast and outvalue opponents in a grindy game."
