With cards like Cauldron Familiar, Mayhem Devil, and Woe Strider, the deck aims to apply pressure early and keep the opponent on the defensive. Additionally, the inclusion of spells like Claim the Firstborn and Judith, the Scourge Diva allows for additional damage to be dealt and for control over the opponent's creatures. The deck's focus is on quick aggression and efficient creature interactions."
