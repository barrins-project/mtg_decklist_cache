The deck aims to outvalue the opponent with card advantage from powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Tamiyo, and Narset, as well as recursion with Elspeth Conquers Death. With Yorion as a companion, the deck can take advantage of flickering effects to gain even more value from enters-the-battlefield triggers. The deck has a strong late game plan with powerful threats like Uro and Agent of Treachery, while maintaining control of the game with disruption spells."

            "notes": "This aggressive Rakdos deck focuses on sacrificing creatures for value while dealing direct damage to the opponent. By utilizing cards like Witch's Oven and Cauldron Familiar, players can create a loop of sacrificing and dealing damage to drain their opponent's life total. Additionally, with cards like Mayhem Devil and Judith, the Scourge Diva, players can make every sacrifice count by dealing additional damage. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion amplifies the damage output of the deck, making it a fast and lethal aggro strategy."

By incorporating a range of removal spells, counterspells, and card advantage engines, the deck aims to out-value the opponent and eventually overwhelm them with powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Cavalier of Thorns. With the help of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion, the deck can generate additional value and create a more resilient board state. The mana base is carefully curated to support the deck's three-color identity and ensure consistent access to its spells."
