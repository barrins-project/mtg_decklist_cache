By maximizing the odd converted mana cost cards, it takes advantage of the bonus damage provided by Obosh, the Preypiercer. The key strategy is to consistently apply pressure, generate value from sacrificing creatures, and disrupt your opponent's game plan to secure a swift victory. Utilizing cards like Cauldron Familiar, Mayhem Devil, and Claim the Firstborn, this deck aims to end the game before the opponent can stabilize."
