It utilizes cards like Master of the Pearl Trident, Lord of Atlantis, and Merfolk Mistbinder to buff up its creatures. Aether Vial allows for quick creature deployment, while cards like Merfolk Trickster and Brazen Borrower provide disruptive elements to control the board. Spreading Seas is used to disrupt opponents' mana bases, while Psionic Blast and Dismember provide direct removal. The deck aims to establish board control early and maintain pressure to secure a quick victory."
