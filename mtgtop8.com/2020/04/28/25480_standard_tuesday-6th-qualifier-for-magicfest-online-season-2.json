The deck also includes Kaheera, the Orphanguard as a companion for additional synergy with its creature choices. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with large threats and removal, while maintaining control of the game."

            "notes": "This deck aims to quickly flood the board with creatures and utilize Winota's ability to cheat powerful creatures into play. The key strategy is to use cards like Raise the Alarm, Legion Warboss, and Hanged Executioner to create multiple creature tokens, triggering Winota's ability to put high-impact creatures like Agent of Treachery into play for free. The deck also includes Teferi, Time Raveler to protect against removal and disrupt opponent's plays. Overall, the deck focuses on overwhelming the opponent with aggressive creature plays and powerful Winota triggers to quickly secure victory."
