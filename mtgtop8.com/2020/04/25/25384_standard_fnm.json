The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with early game pressure and finish them off with big, impactful creatures like Drakuseth, Maw of Flames. Klothys, God of Destiny helps to deal with graveyard strategies and provides additional value. The deck also includes powerful spells and creatures with odd converted mana costs to take advantage of the companion rule. Ultimately, the deck aims to dominate the board and quickly close out the game."
