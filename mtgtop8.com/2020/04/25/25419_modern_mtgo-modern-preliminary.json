It aims to play aggressively by casting low-cost spells and creatures to chip away at the opponent's life total while controlling the board with disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Lightning Bolt. Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by allowing you to recur small creatures and other spells from your graveyard. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with a combination of fast, powerful threats and efficient removal."
