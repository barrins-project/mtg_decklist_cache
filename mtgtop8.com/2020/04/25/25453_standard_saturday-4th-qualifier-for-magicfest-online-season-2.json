The deck is built around control elements such as Teferi, Time Raveler, Narset, Parter of Veils, and board wipes like Shatter the Sky. It also includes ramp cards like Growth Spiral and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to help stabilize the mana base and accelerate to late-game threats like Agent of Treachery. The overall strategy is to out-value the opponent through card advantage and efficient removal."
