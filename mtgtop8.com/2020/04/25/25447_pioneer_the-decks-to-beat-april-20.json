The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats early in the game while disrupting their game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push. The inclusion of The Great Henge and Nissa, Who Shakes the World provides additional card advantage and ramp potential. The \"Obosh, the Preypiercer\" companion adds consistency and a unique twist to the aggressive game plan. Overall, the deck aims to close out games quickly with its strong creatures and disruptive spells."
