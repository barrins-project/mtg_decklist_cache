By utilizing cards like Memory Leak and Startling Development, you can disrupt your opponent's strategy while building up your own cycling engine. With Lurrus of the Dream-Den as your companion, you can continuously bring back impactful cards from your graveyard, ensuring a steady stream of threats for your opponent to deal with. This deck's strength lies in its ability to consistently apply pressure and close out games quickly."

The key strategy is to apply pressure consistently and finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. The synergy between the creatures and burn spells allows for a fast and aggressive playstyle."
