By utilizing cards like Thoughtseize, Demonic Pact, and Doom Foretold, the deck aims to dictate the pace of the game and outvalue the opponent. The inclusion of cards like The Eldest Reborn and Starfield of Nyx provides additional ways to control the board and maintain a dominant position. Ultimately, the deck seeks to grind out a win through attrition and overwhelming the opponent with its powerful control tools."
