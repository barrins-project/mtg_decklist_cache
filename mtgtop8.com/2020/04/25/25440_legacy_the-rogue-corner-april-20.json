The deck includes various card draw and manipulation spells to dig for its combo pieces, while also running countermagic and protection to ensure the combo resolves successfully. Additionally, cards like [[Force of Will]] and [[Veil of Summer]] help to protect the combo from disruption, allowing for a consistent and efficient win condition in a Legacy 1 vs 1 format."
