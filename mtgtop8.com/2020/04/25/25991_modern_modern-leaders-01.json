The deck aims to control the board and limit the opponent's options with a mix of counterspells, removal spells, and card advantage engines. The win condition is to establish a strong presence with planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, while maintaining control of the game through various versatile spells and abilities."
