It focuses on accelerating mana development with cards like Explore and Sakura-Tribe Elder, while also providing land synergy with Dryad of the Ilysian Grove. The deck also includes cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Tatyova, Benthic Druid for additional value and card advantage. By tutoring for key pieces with Summoner's Pact and controlling the board with Primal Command, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its combo potential."
