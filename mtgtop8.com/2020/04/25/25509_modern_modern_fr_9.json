It also utilizes snow permanents for value, with cards like Arcum's Astrolabe and Ice-Fang Coatl providing card advantage and mana fixing. The deck aims to stall the game until it can land a threat like Batterskull or Sword of Feast and Famine to close out the game. The combination of control elements, versatile creatures like Uro and Snapcaster Mage, and powerful lands like Celestial Colonnade make it a formidable opponent in the Modern format."
