            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly swarm the board with low-cost creatures and utilize sacrifice effects to gain value and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck focuses on sacrificing creatures to trigger effects like Priest of Forgotten Gods and Witch's Oven, while also using Cauldron Familiar to repeatedly gain life and ping the opponent. Additionally, Fiend Artisan and Call of the Death-Dweller provide opportunities to tutor for key creatures and recur them from the graveyard. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggression and disruption."
