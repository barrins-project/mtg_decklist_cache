            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively utilize sacrifice and reanimation mechanics to overwhelm the opponent. By sacrificing creatures like Cauldron Familiar and Gutterbones with Witch's Oven and Priest of Forgotten Gods, the deck can trigger effects like Mayhem Devil and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger to deal consistent damage while disrupting the opponent's strategy. Claim the Firstborn allows for stealing key creatures from the opponent, while Tymaret Calls the Dead provide card advantage and graveyard recursion. The deck aims to control the board and steadily chip away at the opponent's life total."
