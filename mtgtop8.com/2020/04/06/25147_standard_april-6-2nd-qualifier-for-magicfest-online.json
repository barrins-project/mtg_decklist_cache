The inclusion of cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Castle Embereth further enhance the deck's ability to deal damage efficiently. With a low mana curve and a fast-paced playstyle, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to establish their own strategy."
