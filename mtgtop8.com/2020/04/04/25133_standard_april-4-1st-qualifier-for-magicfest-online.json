By utilizing cards such as Lucky Clover and Edgewall Innkeeper, the deck aims to draw extra cards and ramp into powerful threats like Lovestruck Beast and Beanstalk Giant. Fae of Wishes provides additional flexibility by allowing the player to search for specific answers or finishers from their sideboard. The deck's aggressive strategy is supported by disruptive threats like Brazen Borrower and Bonecrusher Giant, making it a versatile and formidable aggro deck in the Standard format."
