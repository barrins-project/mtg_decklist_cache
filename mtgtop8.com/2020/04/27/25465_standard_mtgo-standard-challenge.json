The deck aims to stall the game with counterspells, removal, and board wipes while building up resources through card draw and ramp spells. The key strategy is to outvalue the opponent by generating incremental advantages over time, eventually overwhelming them with powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Agent of Treachery. Yorion, Sky Nomad provides additional value by blinking permanents for extra card advantage."
