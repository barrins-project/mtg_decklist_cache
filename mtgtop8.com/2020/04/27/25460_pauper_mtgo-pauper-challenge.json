The key concept is to assemble Urzatron lands to generate large amounts of mana quickly, allowing for the casting of big spells. The deck also includes bounce effects and counterspells to disrupt the opponent's strategy and prolong the game until the control player can establish dominance. It aims to outvalue the opponent by efficiently using its resources and slowly building up towards a game-winning board state."

Mnemonic Wall and Mulldrifter provide card advantage, while Ghostly Flicker and Ephemerate allow for powerful synergies with enters-the-battlefield effects. Mystical Teachings provides toolbox access to answers and threats, making the deck versatile and adaptable to different matchups."
