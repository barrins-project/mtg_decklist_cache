            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing sacrifice effects and recursion to generate value and pressure on the opponent. By combining cards like Claim the Firstborn, Witch's Oven, and Priest of Forgotten Gods with creatures like Cauldron Familiar and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger, the deck aims to control the board and chip away at the opponent's life total with continuous pressure. The synergy between sacrificing, recurring, and dealing damage makes it difficult for opponents to stabilize and allows the deck to maintain tempo and aggression throughout the game."

The deck aims to outvalue the opponent with efficient spells, card draw, and powerful late-game threats like Expansion / Explosion. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the three colors of the Temur wedge while ensuring consistent access to all necessary colors."
