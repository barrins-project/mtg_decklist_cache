Using cards like Flourishing Fox and Valiant Rescuer, along with cycling cards like Boon of the Wish-Giver and Startling Development, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creatures and direct damage. Zenith Flare serves as a powerful finisher by dealing damage based on the number of cards cycled. The key strategy is to maintain a steady card advantage through cycling while applying pressure with aggressive creatures and burn spells."
