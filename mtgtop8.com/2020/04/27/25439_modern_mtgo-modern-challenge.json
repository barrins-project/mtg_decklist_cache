Karn, the Great Creator helps find key artifacts and shuts down opposing strategies. The deck uses lands like Castle Garenbrig and Valakut to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent's creatures and face. It can generate a lot of value by utilizing cards such as Dryad of the Ilysian Grove and Field of the Dead. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and burn effects from Valakut triggers."
