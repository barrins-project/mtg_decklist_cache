The key strategy is to apply pressure early on and maintain a relentless assault with a mix of creature and spell-based damage. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize, utilizing powerful cards like Torbran, Embercleave, and Anax to maximize damage output and close out the game swiftly."
