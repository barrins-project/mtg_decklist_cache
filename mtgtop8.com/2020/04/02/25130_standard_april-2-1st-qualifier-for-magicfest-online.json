By sacrificing creatures like Cauldron Familiar and Mire Triton with cards like Witch's Oven and Claim the Firstborn, players can trigger powerful effects such as Mayhem Devil's pinging ability and Tymaret Calls the Dead's graveyard recursion. Additionally, cards like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Woe Strider provide additional value through escape and escape mechanics. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a constant stream of creatures and damage while disrupting their game plan with removal and sacrifice effects."
