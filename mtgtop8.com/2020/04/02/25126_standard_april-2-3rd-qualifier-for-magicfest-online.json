The deck focuses on maintaining board control with removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire, while also having the potential to finish off opponents with Expanion/Explosion. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides continuous advantage throughout the game, while Brazen Borrower adds flexibility in dealing with threats. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue opponents through efficient use of resources and strategic decision-making."
