It also includes removal spells like Shatter the Sky and Elspeth Conquers Death to deal with threats. The deck aims to ramp up its mana with cards like Growth Spiral and Nissa, allowing it to play powerful threats like Hydroid Krasis and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. With Knight of Autumn providing flexibility and utility, the deck aims to out-value and outlast opponents in a slower, more controlling game plan."
