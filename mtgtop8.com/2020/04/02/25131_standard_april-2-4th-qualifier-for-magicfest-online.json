            "notes": "The deck focuses on using counterspells, card draw, and ramp to control the game while generating value from cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Niv-Mizzet, Parun. Wilderness Reclamation helps generate additional mana for big spells like Expansion / Explosion, while cards like Thassa's Intervention and Aether Gust help control the opponent's board. The deck's win condition is typically through card advantage and tempo swings, outvaluing the opponent while preventing them from executing their game plan effectively. It's a versatile and adaptable control deck that aims to outlast and outplay the opponent."
