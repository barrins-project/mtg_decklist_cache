The deck includes a mix of ramp cards like Growth Spiral and Incubation Druid, along with powerful creatures like Dream Trawler and Elite Guardmage to control the board. Thassa, Deep-Dwelling is used to flicker creatures for extra value, while Fiend Artisan can search for key combo pieces. Luminous Broodmoth provides recursion and Spark Double can copy crucial creatures. The mana base is well-balanced to support these strategies."
