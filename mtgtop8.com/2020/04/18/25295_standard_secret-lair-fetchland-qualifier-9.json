The key strategy is to generate card advantage through cards like Edgewall Innkeeper and Lucky Clover, while also utilizing powerful threats like Beanstalk Giant and Lovestruck Beast. The deck also includes control elements such as Brazen Borrower and Bonecrusher Giant to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base is designed to help cast the different colored spells efficiently to maintain a consistent pressure on the opponent."
