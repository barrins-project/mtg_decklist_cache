            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to control the game by countering opponent's spells, removing threats, and generating card advantage. It aims to stall the game with board wipes and removal spells until it can drop powerful finishers like Dream Trawler and Archon of Sun's Grace. The deck also utilizes planeswalkers like Narset, Teferi, and utility lands like Castle Ardenvale to grind out incremental advantages. The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win conditions for a long game."
