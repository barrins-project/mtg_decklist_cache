By combining mana acceleration creatures such as Llanowar Elves and Priest of Titania with powerful Elf synergies like Timberwatch Elf and Lys Alana Huntmaster, the deck is able to generate large amounts of mana and pump out a high number of creatures to attack for massive damage. Lead the Stampede and Distant Melody provide card draw to keep the momentum going, while cards like Viridian Longbow and Gruesome Fate offer additional ways to deal with threats on the opponent's side of the board."
