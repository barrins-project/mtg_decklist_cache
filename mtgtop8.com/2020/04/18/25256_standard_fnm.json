The key strategy is to establish a stable board presence using big threats like Cavalier of Flame and Kenrith, the Returned King, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Aether Gust. The deck aims to control the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful creatures and spells."
