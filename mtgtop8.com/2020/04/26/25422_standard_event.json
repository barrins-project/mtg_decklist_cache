Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset of the Ancient Way help to control the opponent's plays and maintain card advantage. The deck also features powerful finishers like Cavalier of Flame and Kenrith, the Returned King to close out games. The mana base is designed to support the color requirements of the spells in the deck, with a focus on consistency and stability for the control strategy."
