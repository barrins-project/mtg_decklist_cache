The strategy revolves around using powerful Planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset, Parter of Veils to control the board and disrupt the opponent's plans. The deck utilizes a variety of removal spells like Shatter the Sky and Elspeth Conquers Death to deal with threats, while maintaining card advantage with cards like Omen of the Sea. The win condition of the deck is to eventually drop a powerful threat like Dream Trawler to close out the game."
