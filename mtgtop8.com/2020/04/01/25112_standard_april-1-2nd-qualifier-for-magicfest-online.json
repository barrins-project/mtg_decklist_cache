The key strategy revolves around sacrificing creatures, using effects like Witch's Oven and Priest of Forgotten Gods to generate value and disrupt the opponent. Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Mayhem Devil provide additional pressure and synergy with sacrificing creatures. Claim the Firstborn allows for stealing an opponent's key creature to either use as sacrifice fodder or to swing the game in your favor. Overall, this deck aims to control the board and finish off the opponent quickly with a combination of aggressive plays and sacrifice effects."
