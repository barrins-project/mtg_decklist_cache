By utilizing the Companion Obosh, the Preypiercer, all odd-costed creatures in the deck receive a significant power boost, increasing the deck's damage output. With a mix of low-cost creatures like Gutterbones and Serrated Scorpion, along with powerful threats like Rotting Regisaur and Hunted Nightmare, this Mono Black Aggro deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
