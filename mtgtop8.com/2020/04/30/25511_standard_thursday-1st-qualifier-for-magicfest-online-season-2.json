The deck also includes powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Agent of Treachery to close out the game. With Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion, the deck can take advantage of blinking effects and additional card advantage. The mana base is designed to consistently hit all colors needed for spells and provides flexibility for the deck's various requirements."
