By sacrificing creatures like Cauldron Familiar and Serrated Scorpion with Witch's Oven and Woe Strider, you can trigger multiple effects such as dealing damage with Mayhem Devil and drawing cards with Whisper Squad. With Obosh as a companion, all the odd converted mana cost creatures in the deck deal extra damage, further increasing the aggro potential of the deck. Overall, this deck excels at maintaining pressure and steadily chipping away at the opponent's life total."
