The deck focuses on cards like Rally the Ancestors and Return to the Ranks to bring multiple creatures back from the graveyard at once, triggering abilities like Cruel Celebrant and Zulaport Cutthroat to drain the opponent's life. Additionally, cards like Stitcher's Supplier and Satyr Wayfinder help to fill the graveyard while Fiend Artisan acts as a versatile threat that can search for key creatures. This deck aims to quickly apply pressure and overwhelm the opponent with a constant drain of life."

The presence of Yorion as a companion provides additional flicker opportunities and card advantage. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Stasis Snare and Gideon's Intervention to control the board, while cards like Heliod, Sun-Crowned and Elspeth Conquers Death provide late-game power and resilience. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and resilience."
