It combines elements of sacrifice with recursion to create a resilient and constantly threatening board presence. The main goal is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures, disruptive spells, and difficult-to-remove threats, all while maintaining a high tempo throughout the game. The key concept revolves around utilizing sacrifice and recursion as a means to generate advantage and maintain board presence."
