By bouncing and replaying creatures like Agent of Treachery and Brazen Borrower, as well as utilizing cards like Thassa, Deep-Dwelling and Charming Prince, the deck aims to control the board while steadily advancing its own game plan. This deck also includes disruptive elements like Teferi, Time Raveler and Elspeth Conquers Death to further hinder the opponent's strategy and maintain tempo advantage. With a mix of evasion, card advantage, and disruption, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a solid board presence."
