It aims to stall the game with board wipes like Shatter the Sky, while generating card advantage with cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Tamiyo, Collector of Tales. The deck also disrupts the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Mystical Dispute and Aether Gust. It ramps up mana quickly with Growth Spiral and Nissa, Who Shakes the World, allowing for big plays with cards like Hydroid Krasis and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. Ultimately, the goal is to establish a dominant board presence and overwhelm the opponent."
