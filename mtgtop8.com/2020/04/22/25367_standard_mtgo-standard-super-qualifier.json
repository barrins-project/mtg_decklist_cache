It aims to stall the game until it can play its big threats like Shark Typhoon and Agent of Treachery. The companion, Yorion, Sky Nomad, provides extra value by blinking permanents for additional ETB triggers. The mana base is designed to support three colors while also allowing for flexibility in casting spells at different points in the game."
