By utilizing cards like Cauldron Familiar, Dreadhorde Butcher, and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger, the deck can deal damage efficiently while also disrupting the opponent's game plan. Claim the Firstborn and Call of the Death-Dweller provide additional ways to steal and reuse creatures from the opponent. The deck aims to control the board through sacrifice synergies and win through consistent, aggressive plays."
