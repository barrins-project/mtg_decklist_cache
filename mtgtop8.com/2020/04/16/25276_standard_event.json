By combining cards like Claim the Firstborn, Witch's Oven, and Cauldron Familiar, the deck can generate incremental advantage and chip away at the opponent's life total. The deck also utilizes strong finishers like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Chandra, Acolyte of Flame to close out games quickly. The key strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan with targeted removal and sacrifice effects."
