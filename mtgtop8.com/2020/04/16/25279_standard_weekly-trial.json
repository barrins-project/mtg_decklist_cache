The key strategy is to use Lucky Clover to generate extra value from Adventure cards, while also ramping up with Beanstalk Giant and Fae of Wishes. The deck includes removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire and Aether Gust to control the board. Escape to the Wilds allows for card advantage and flexibility in the late game. The mana base is optimized for casting spells of all colors efficiently."
