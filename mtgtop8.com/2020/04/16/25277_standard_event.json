These sacrifices trigger powerful effects like Mayhem Devil's ping ability and Midnight Reaper's card draw, while Rankle, Master of Pranks provides additional disruption. Additionally, the deck includes Claim the Firstborn to steal opponent's creatures and Castle Locthwain for extra card draw. This aggressive strategy aims to overwhelm opponents quickly and efficiently."
