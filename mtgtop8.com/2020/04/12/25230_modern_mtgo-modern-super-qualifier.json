The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Wrenn and Six to generate value and control the board. With a versatile removal suite including Lightning Bolt, Fatal Push, and Assassin's Trophy, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with efficient threats and disruption."
