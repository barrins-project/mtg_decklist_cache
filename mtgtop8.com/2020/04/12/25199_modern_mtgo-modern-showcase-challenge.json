Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide provide early pressure while Eidolon of the Great Revel punishes opponents for playing spells. The deck also includes land cards that can deal damage to help close out games. The strategy is to maintain a fast pace and overwhelm opponents before they can stabilize or gain momentum."
