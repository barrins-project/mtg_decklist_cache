Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Teferi, Time Raveler provide card selection and recursion, while cards like Arcum's Astrolabe and Mox Amber help to generate mana and fix colors. The inclusion of cards like Thassa's Oracle and Monastery Mentor offer alternative win conditions in case the primary combo is disrupted. This deck aims to take advantage of powerful synergies and combos to overwhelm opponents in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."
