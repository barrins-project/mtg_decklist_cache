The inclusion of cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Ice-Fang Coatl provide additional value and flexibility to the deck's strategy. The mana base is optimized to support the deck's multi-color requirements and the inclusion of snow-covered lands allows for additional synergy with cards like Arcum's Astrolabe and Dead of Winter."

By utilizing various card draw spells, counterspells, and mana acceleration, the player aims to exile their entire library with Thought Lash, then cast Paradigm Shift to move Thassa's Oracle to the top of their library. Upon casting Thassa's Oracle, the player will win the game by having zero cards in their library. The deck is designed to assemble this combo as quickly and reliably as possible while protecting it from disruption."
