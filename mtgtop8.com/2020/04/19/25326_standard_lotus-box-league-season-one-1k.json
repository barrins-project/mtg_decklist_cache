It aims to survive the early game with cards like Brazen Borrower and Scorching Dragonfire, then stabilize in the mid to late game with Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Wilderness Reclamation. With a mix of counterspells like Neutralize and card draw like Thassa's Intervention, the deck can outvalue opponents and win through card advantage or a big Explosion spell. The deck also utilizes powerful lands like Ketria Triome and Castle Vantress to further control the game."

The inclusion of Wilderness Reclamation allows for even more mana acceleration, while Thassa's Intervention and Expansion / Explosion provide flexibility and versatility in handling various situations. Overall, the deck is designed to outlast opponents and reign supreme in the late game."
