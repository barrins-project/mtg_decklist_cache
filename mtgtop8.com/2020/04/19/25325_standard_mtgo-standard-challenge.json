            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly and aggressively build a board presence with low-cost creatures such as Cauldron Familiar, Serrated Scorpion, and Gutterbones, while using cards like Claim the Firstborn and Witch's Oven to disrupt and control your opponent's board. By sacrificing creatures to abilities like Mayhem Devil and Woe Strider, this deck aims to deal damage to the opponent and gain incremental advantages over time. Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion adds another layer of damage to the deck's strategy, making it even more threatening in a 1 vs 1 format."

The deck also includes cards like Humble Naturalist and Paradise Druid to ramp up mana quickly in order to play Gyruda as early as possible and overwhelm the opponent with a powerful combo."
