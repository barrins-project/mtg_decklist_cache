By utilizing low-cost creatures like Fervent Champion and Scorch Spitter, along with powerful finishers like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. With efficient card draw options like Light Up the Stage and disruptive creatures like Robber of the Rich, the deck can maintain pressure on the opponent while controlling the board. The inclusion of Castle Embereth provides additional reach and allows for quick damage output."
