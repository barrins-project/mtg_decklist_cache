It aims to deal damage as fast as possible by playing efficient low-cost creatures like Fervent Champion and Runaway Steam-Kin, while also utilizing direct damage from spells like Shock and Embercleave. The use of creatures like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell enhances the damage output of the deck, while also providing additional threats on the battlefield. The strategy is to apply constant pressure and finish off the opponent before they can stabilize."
