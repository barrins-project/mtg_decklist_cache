It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counters like Sinister Sabotage and Silumgar's Scorn, while using cards like Lightning Strike and Glorybringer for removal and pressure. The planeswalkers, such as Chandra and Narset, provide additional value and card advantage. The deck also includes some card draw with Treasure Cruise and Omen of the Sea to help maintain resources. Overall, the strategy revolves around controlling the game and winning through incremental advantage."

It seeks to grind out the opponent with card advantage from cards like Uro, Tireless Tracker, and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy, ultimately aiming to overpower the opponent and win through incremental advantages. The deck has a strong midrange game plan with the potential to outvalue the opponent in longer games."
