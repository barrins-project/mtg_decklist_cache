The key strategy revolves around sacrificing creatures to trigger various effects, such as dealing damage through Mayhem Devil or gaining value with Midnight Reaper. Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger is a potent threat that punishes the opponent's hand size, while Claim the Firstborn can disrupt the opponent's board state. The combination of sacrifice outlets like Witch's Oven and payoff cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods makes this deck a formidable aggro archetype in Standard 1 vs 1 gameplay."
