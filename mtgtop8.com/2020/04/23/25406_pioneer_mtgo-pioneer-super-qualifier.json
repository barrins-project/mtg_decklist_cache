By combining powerful auras like Sentinel's Eyes, Ethereal Armor, and All That Glitters with creatures like Favored Hoplite and Aphemia, the deck aims to create a fast and aggressive board presence. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional card advantage and recursion, while cards like Sram, Senior Edificer and Hateful Eidolon provide card draw and additional benefits when casting auras."
