It is supported by a solid mana base, disruption with Force of Will, protection with Unsettled Mariner, and card advantage with Aether Vial. The key strategy is to play multiple Slivers each turn and buff them up with various abilities to create a powerful board presence that is hard to deal with. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion provides additional value by allowing the deck to recur creatures from the graveyard."
