By consistently hitting land drops with cards like Growth Spiral and Nissa, Who Shakes the World, the deck aims to outvalue opponents in the mid to late game. Teferi, Time Raveler provides disruption and card advantage, while Elspeth Conquers Death serves as a versatile removal spell. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Hydroid Krasis can help stabilize if the game goes long, while Agent of Treachery can steal key threats from the opponent."
