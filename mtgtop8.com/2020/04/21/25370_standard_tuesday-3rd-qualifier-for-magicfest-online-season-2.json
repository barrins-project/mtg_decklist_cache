The synergy between cards like Witch's Oven and Cauldron Familiar allows for additional damage and disruption. The deck also includes cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods for added control and card advantage. The overall strategy is to maintain board presence, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and close out the game quickly with efficient and powerful creatures."
