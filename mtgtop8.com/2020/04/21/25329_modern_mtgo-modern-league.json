The key concept is to constantly apply pressure to the opponent with a low mana curve and efficient card draw to maintain momentum. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional resources to be used from the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to win the game as quickly as possible by overwhelming the opponent with a combination of creature and burn damage."
