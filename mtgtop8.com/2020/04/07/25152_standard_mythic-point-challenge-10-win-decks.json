By doubling up on Adventure spells with Lucky Clover and generating extra mana with Nissa, Who Shakes the World, the deck can flood the board with threats such as Beanstalk Giant and Lovestruck Beast. Additionally, Fae of Wishes provides flexibility in accessing sideboard options for specific matchups. The mana base is optimized to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent performance in a Standard 1 vs 1 format."

The deck aims to control the board and card advantage through cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset, Parter of Veils, while also having a win condition in Dream Trawler. The deck focuses on maintaining a stable board state through synergy between its cards and is designed to outvalue and outlast the opponent in a longer game."
