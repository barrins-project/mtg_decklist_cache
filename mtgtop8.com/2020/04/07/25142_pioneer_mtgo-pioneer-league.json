The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with early aggression and maintain pressure with cards like Collected Company and The Great Henge. Additionally, the inclusion of Rhonas the Indomitable and Ghalta, Primal Hunger provides strong finishers to close out games. The deck's efficient curve and synergy between creatures and spells make it a formidable force in Pioneer 1 vs 1 matches."

The deck aims to stabilize the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Azorius Charm, while also generating card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation and Glimmer of Genius. The deck is designed to answer threats efficiently and outvalue opponents in the late game, making it difficult for aggressive decks to break through its defenses."
