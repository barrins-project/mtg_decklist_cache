The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Karn, the Great Creator and Chandra, Torch of Defiance to generate card advantage and provide additional threats. The inclusion of Trinisphere and Ensnaring Bridge helps to further lock down the board and limit the opponent's options, allowing the deck to capitalize on its disruptive elements and close out games quickly."
