By combining cards like Claim the Firstborn, Witch's Oven, Priest of Forgotten Gods, and Mayhem Devil, the deck can generate value from sacrificing creatures while also pinging the opponent's life total. Additionally, the deck includes card draw engines like Midnight Reaper and Rix Maadi Reveler to maintain card advantage. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and efficient removal spells."
