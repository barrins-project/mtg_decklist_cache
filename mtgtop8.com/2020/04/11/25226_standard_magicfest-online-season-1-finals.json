Priest of Forgotten Gods, Woe Strider, and Midnight Reaper provide additional sacrifice options and card draw. The deck aims to control the board, drain the opponent's resources, and overwhelm them with constant pressure and powerful triggers."

The deck also includes versatile cards like Expansion / Explosion for flexibility in different situations. The overall goal is to outvalue the opponent by generating card advantage and tempo advantage while maintaining control of the board with efficient removal options like Scorching Dragonfire. The mana base is solid with a mix of dual lands and utility lands for consistency."
