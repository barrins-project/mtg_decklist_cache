The deck also includes disruptive spells like Daze and Force of Will to protect the creatures and maintain tempo. The inclusion of ninjas such as Ingenious Infiltrator adds additional value by allowing for card advantage and the potential for surprise attacks. The deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total while maintaining control of the game through card advantage and disruption."
