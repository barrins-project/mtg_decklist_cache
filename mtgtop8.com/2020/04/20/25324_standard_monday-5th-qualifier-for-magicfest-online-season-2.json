The mana base is optimized for consistency and the addition of Kaheera as a companion provides additional synergy and flexibility in the deck's strategy.

By utilizing cards like Shock, Arclight Phoenix, and Sprite Dragon, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with multiple threats and finish the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The deck also includes card draw options like Radical Idea and Cathartic Reunion to maintain consistency and fuel cards like Rielle, the Everwise. With a mix of burn, evasion, and card advantage, this deck aims to consistently pressure and outpace the opponent."
