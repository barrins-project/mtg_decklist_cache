By having a mix of evasive creatures like Sea-Dasher Octopus and Brazen Borrower, along with card advantage engines like Slitherwisp and Spectral Sailor, the deck aims to outvalue opponents while applying pressure on the board. The inclusion of Lochmere Serpent provides a finisher that can also help control the opponent's resources. The mana base is designed to smoothly cast the deck's spells and maintain consistency in the early game."
