By combining cards like Vizier of Tumbling Sands and Fae of Wishes, the deck aims to manipulate the board state and generate infinite mana loops with Underworld Breach. With this mana advantage, the deck can then use Thassa's Oracle to win the game by decking out the opponent. Overall, the deck is focused on assembling a powerful combo engine to overwhelm the opponent."
