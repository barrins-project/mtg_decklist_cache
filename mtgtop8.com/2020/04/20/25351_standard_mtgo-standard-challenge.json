            "notes": "This deck focuses on using small, efficient creatures and recurring them from the graveyard to quickly overwhelm the opponent. By utilizing sacrifice effects and graveyard recursion, the deck aims to maintain a steady stream of threats while controlling the board with removal spells. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional graveyard recursion and benefits from the deck's low mana curve. The key strategy is to apply constant pressure while disrupting the opponent's game plan, leading to a fast and aggressive victory."
