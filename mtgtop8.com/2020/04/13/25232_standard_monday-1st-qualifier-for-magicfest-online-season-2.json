            "notes": "The main focus of this Aggro - Red Deck Wins archetype is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and efficient burn spells. By playing low-cost creatures like Fervent Champion, Scorch Spitter, and Runaway Steam-Kin, as well as powerful finishers like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, this deck aims to apply constant pressure and deal damage efficiently. With the use of cards like Light Up the Stage and Castle Embereth, the deck can maintain momentum and close out games quickly before the opponent can stabilize."

Wilderness Reclamation is used to generate extra mana for explosive plays with Expansion / Explosion. The deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent with its versatile spells and powerful creatures. The mana base is carefully constructed to support both the early game ramp and the late game threats."
