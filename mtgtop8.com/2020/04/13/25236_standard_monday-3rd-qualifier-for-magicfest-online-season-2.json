It utilizes powerful Simic creatures like Nightpack Ambusher, Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and Hydroid Krasis to put pressure on the opponent while also maintaining control with counter spells like Mystical Dispute and Aether Gust. The deck aims to ramp up quickly with cards like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Growth Spiral, enabling it to play its big threats earlier than the opponent can handle. Overall, the deck is designed to be a versatile and aggressive force on the battlefield."
