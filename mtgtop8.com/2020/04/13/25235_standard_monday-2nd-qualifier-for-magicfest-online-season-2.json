The deck focuses on quickly establishing a board presence with powerful creatures such as Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Hydroid Krasis, and utilizes cards like Risen Reef and Thassa, Deep-Dwelling to generate additional value from enters-the-battlefield triggers. The deck also includes some control elements with cards like Agent of Treachery and Cavalier of Thorns to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain board control."
