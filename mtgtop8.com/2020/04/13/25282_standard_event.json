By using cards like Cauldron Familiar, Gutterbones, and Woe Strider in combination with Witch's Oven and Mayhem Devil, the deck aims to control the board and pressure the opponent with constant attacks. Additionally, cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods and Midnight Reaper provide additional ways to generate value and dig through the deck for more threats. The deck's goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of aggressive creatures and burn spells."
