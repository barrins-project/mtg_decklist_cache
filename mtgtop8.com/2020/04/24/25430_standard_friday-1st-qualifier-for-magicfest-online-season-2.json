With a high density of counterspells, removal, and card draw, the deck aims to outvalue opponents and eventually win with powerful finishers like Dream Trawler and Shark Typhoon. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for extra value by blinking permanents for additional enters-the-battlefield triggers. Overall, the deck seeks to control the game until it can establish a dominating position and secure the win."
