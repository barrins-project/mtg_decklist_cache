The goal is to maintain control of the game by using cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Cavalier of Flame to outvalue the opponent, while employing card advantage from Sphinx of Foresight and Narset of the Ancient Way. The deck also includes a high mana curve to take advantage of Keruga, the Macrosage as a companion, ensuring card advantage while maintaining a strong board presence."
