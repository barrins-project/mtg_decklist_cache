Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger provides additional pressure while disruption cards like Claim the Firstborn and Mire's Grasp help control the board. Lurrus of the Dream-Den allows you to recast your low-cost creatures from the graveyard, maintaining a steady stream of threats."

The key strategy is to use cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods, Witch's Oven, and Claim the Firstborn to control the board and take advantage of sacrificing creatures for additional benefits like draining life from the opponent. By using cards like Corpse Knight and Cruel Celebrant to capitalize on sacrificing creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of damage while also disrupting their game plan."
