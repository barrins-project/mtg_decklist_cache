The goal is to control the board with cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods and Claim the Firstborn, while recurring threats with Lurrus of the Dream-Den and Call of the Death-Dweller. Utilizing synergy between cards like Cauldron Familiar and Witch's Oven, this deck aims to maintain constant pressure and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Castle Locthwain provides card advantage, while Fabled Passage ensures consistent mana fixing."

Nightpack Ambusher provides a constant threat while Uro provides additional card draw and lifegain. The deck can generate massive amounts of mana with Wilderness Reclamation and finish off the opponent with a large Expansion / Explosion or Shark Typhoon token. The key to success lies in efficiently answering threats while developing its own board presence and overwhelming the opponent with card advantage and powerful spells."
