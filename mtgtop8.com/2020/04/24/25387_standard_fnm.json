By sacrificing creatures like Cauldron Familiar, Dreadhorde Butcher, and Serrated Scorpion with cards like Witch's Oven and Priest of Forgotten Gods, players can trigger effects and power up Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger. The deck also includes cards like Claim the Firstborn and Call of the Death-Dweller to further manipulate the battlefield and maintain pressure on opponents."
