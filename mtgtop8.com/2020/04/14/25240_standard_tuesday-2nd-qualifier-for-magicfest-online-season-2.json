The key strategy is to establish board presence early with creatures like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, then finish off the opponent with powerful combat tricks like Embercleave. Castle Embereth also provides additional damage output, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize and turn the game in the deck's favor."
