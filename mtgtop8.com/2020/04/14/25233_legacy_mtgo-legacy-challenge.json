By combining aggressive artifact creatures like Urza and Emry with disruptive artifacts like Chalice of the Void and Defense Grid, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of card advantage, mana acceleration, and disruptive effects. Karn, the Great Creator acts as a versatile toolbox while Narset, Parter of Veils and Echo of Eons provide additional disruption and card draw. With a focus on fast and efficient plays, this deck aims for a strong tempo advantage in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."

By dredging cards like Stinkweed Imp and Golgari Grave-Troll, the player can quickly build up a graveyard full of creatures and trigger effects like Bridge from Below. The deck also includes cards like Faithless Looting and Cabal Therapy to help dig through the deck and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures and take advantage of graveyard synergies to win the game."
