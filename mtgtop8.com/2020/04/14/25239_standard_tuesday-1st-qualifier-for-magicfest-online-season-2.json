By utilizing cards like Cauldron Familiar and Witch's Oven to repeatedly sacrifice creatures, along with Priest of Forgotten Gods to further drain the opponent's resources, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats and disruption. Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Mayhem Devil provide additional firepower and punish the opponent for their actions, making it difficult for them to stabilize and turn the tide in their favor."
