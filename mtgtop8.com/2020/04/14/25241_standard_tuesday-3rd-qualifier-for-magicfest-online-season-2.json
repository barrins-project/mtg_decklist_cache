It uses a mix of counterspells like Mystical Dispute, Aether Gust, and Negate to deal with threats, while also having ways to generate card advantage through Growth Spiral, Opt, and Expansion / Explosion. Storm's Wrath helps to clear the board of creatures, while Brazen Borrower and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provide additional threats and value. The deck aims to out value and outlast the opponent through control and card advantage."
