The deck utilizes a combination of hand disruption, removal spells, and powerful planeswalkers like Liliana and Nissa to control the game. The deck also leverages the graveyard with cards like Uro and Grisly Salvage to provide additional resources and fuel the late-game threats like Emrakul. By managing the board and controlling the game's pace, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent to secure victory."

The deck also utilizes disruptive elements like Spell Queller and Mausoleum Wanderer to control the game and protect its creatures. With a mixture of aggressive creatures and tempo plays, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early on and maintain pressure throughout the game. Additionally, Collected Company provides the deck with additional creature options and the potential for explosive turns."
