The deck aims to ramp up quickly with mana dorks like Paradise Druid and Arboreal Grazer, and then deploy threats like Dream Trawler and Hydroid Krasis to close out the game. By utilizing a mix of card advantage, ramp, and control elements, this deck aims to out-value and outmaneuver the opponent in a slower, more methodical game plan."
