The deck features powerful creatures like Spell Queller, Snapcaster Mage, and Stoneforge Mystic to apply pressure and generate card advantage. The inclusion of control staples like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Cryptic Command, and Force of Negation allows the deck to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own threats. Additionally, the deck utilizes a small suite of removal spells in the form of Path to Exile and counterspells such as Mana Leak and Spell Snare to maintain control over the board. The inclusion of equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine provides additional threats and power to the deck. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to control the game and win through superior card advantage and powerful creatures."
