Cards like Soul-Scar Mage, Monastery Swiftspear, and Goblin Rabblemaster put pressure on the opponent early on, while burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock can help clear the way or go straight to the opponent's face. Torbran, Thane of Red Fell amplifies all damage dealt by red sources, making your burn spells even more potent. The goal is to be swift and efficient in defeating your opponent."
