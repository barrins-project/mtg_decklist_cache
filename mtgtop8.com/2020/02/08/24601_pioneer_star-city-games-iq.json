The deck aims to stabilize the board and gain incremental advantages over time, ultimately leading to a win condition like Emrakul, the Promised End or Nissa, Who Shakes the World to close out the game. The deck balances controlling the opponent's threats and advancing its own game plan to eventually outvalue and outlast the opponent."
