With a mix of counterspells like Absorb and Dovin's Veto, along with board wipes like Time Wipe and Shatter the Sky, the deck aims to keep the board clear and prevent the opponent from gaining momentum. Cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset, Parter of Veils provide additional control elements, while finishers like Dream Trawler and Elspeth Conquers Death help close out the game once the opponent's resources are depleted."
