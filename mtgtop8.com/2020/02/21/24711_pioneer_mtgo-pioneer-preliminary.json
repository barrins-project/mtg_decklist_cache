            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly flooding the board with small, efficient creatures and using anthem effects like Heliod, Sun-Crowned to boost their power. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures, while also utilizing removal spells like Stasis Snare to deal with any threats in the way. The deck also includes some card advantage engines like Arcanist's Owl and Thraben Inspector, allowing for consistent pressure and resource management. By combining aggro strategies with a weenie white archetype, this deck aims to establish board control and close out the game swiftly."
