The deck also includes cards like Cunning Wish and Teferi, Time Raveler to provide additional utility and protection. The key strategy is to set up the combo pieces quickly with cards like Brainstorm and Preordain, while also having access to counterspells like Force of Will to protect the combo from disruption. The mana base is designed to support the deck's game plan efficiently."
