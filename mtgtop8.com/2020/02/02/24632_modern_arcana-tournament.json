By efficiently using spells like Lightning Bolt, Gut Shot, and Lava Dart to remove threats and deal direct damage, it aims to finish the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The deck also utilizes cards like Manamorphose and Light Up the Stage to maintain card advantage and keep up the pressure. Additionally, Young Pyromancer and Seasoned Pyromancer provide extra creature tokens to further push the aggro strategy."
