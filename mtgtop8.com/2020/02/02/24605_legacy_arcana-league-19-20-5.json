Your goal is to overwhelm your opponent with a swarm of creatures and take advantage of key cards like Hogaak, Arisen Necropolis and Narcomoeba to maintain board presence and disrupt your opponent's strategy. Cabal Therapy and Once Upon a Time help you dig for key combo pieces, while Phantasmagorian allows you to discard cards for further graveyard recursion."

The deck also has a combo win condition with Thespian's Stage and Dark Depths to create a 20/20 indestructible Marit Lage token. The goal is to control the game and outvalue the opponent until you can assemble your win condition."

Karn, the Great Creator is used to tutor for key artifacts like Mystic Forge and Chalice of the Void to disrupt opponents' strategies. The deck runs a low land count with fast mana sources like Lotus Petal and Mox Opal to quickly assemble the combo and overwhelm opponents with powerful threats. The strategy relies on efficient card filtering with Mishra's Bauble and Urza's Bauble to find combo pieces and close out games quickly."

The deck also utilizes card advantage through cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder, as well as the versatility of cards like Snapcaster Mage and Baleful Strix. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Oko, Thief of Crowns provide additional control elements while also generating value. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's diverse range of spells and colors."
