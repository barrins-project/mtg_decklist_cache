By utilizing cards like Collected Company to quickly put multiple creatures into play, along with powerful Spirit lords like Supreme Phantom and Empyrean Eagle to boost the team's power, this deck aims to apply consistent pressure and close out games swiftly. With disruptive elements like Spell Queller and Nebelgast Herald, along with efficient threats like Brazen Borrower, this deck can disrupt opposing strategies while maintaining a fast clock."
