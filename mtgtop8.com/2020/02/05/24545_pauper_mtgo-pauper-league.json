            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to control the game by using cards that allow for removal, disruption of the opponent's strategy, and gaining incremental advantage over time. The Orzhov Pestilence archetype focuses on using the Pestilence enchantment combined with creatures that can survive its effect, such as Lone Missionary and Guardian of the Guildpact. The deck also includes cards like Chainer's Edict and Castigate to deal with opposing threats and disrupt their game plan. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent through careful resource management and control elements."
