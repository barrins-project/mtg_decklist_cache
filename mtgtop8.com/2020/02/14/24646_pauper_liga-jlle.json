With a mix of disruption, card advantage, and direct damage, the deck aims to maintain a steady flow of pressure on the opponent while stripping their hand of resources. The inclusion of finishers like Gurmag Angler and Ill-Gotten Inheritance keeps the pressure on late game, making it difficult for opponents to stabilize. With a focus on tempo and disruption, this deck aims to keep opponents on the back foot from the start."
