By utilizing cards like Champion of the Parish, Thalia's Lieutenant, and Noble Hierarch, the deck can quickly grow its creatures while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Meddling Mage. The use of Aether Vial and Cavern of Souls helps to ensure that the deck can consistently deploy its creatures efficiently, allowing for a consistent and potent aggro strategy."
