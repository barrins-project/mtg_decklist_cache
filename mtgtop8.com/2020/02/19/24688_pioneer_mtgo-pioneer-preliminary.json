By utilizing low-cost creatures like Bloodsoaked Champion and Dread Wanderer, along with powerful cards like Knight of the Ebon Legion and Rankle, Master of Pranks, the deck aims to apply pressure early in the game. Thoughtseize and Fatal Push provide disruption against the opponent's strategies, while Castle Locthwain and Mutavault offer additional resources and versatility. Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth ensures a consistent mana base for casting spells efficiently."
