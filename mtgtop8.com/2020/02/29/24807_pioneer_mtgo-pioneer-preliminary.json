With cheap creatures and burn spells, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently, using cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Bonecrusher Giant to push through damage. Ramunap Ruins and Castle Embereth provide additional reach with their activated abilities, allowing the deck to close out games even if the opponent manages to stabilize."

The inclusion of card draw spells like Omen of the Sea and Dig Through Time helps ensure that the deck can maintain a steady stream of resources to stay ahead in the late game."
