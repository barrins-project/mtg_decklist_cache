By combining fast mana acceleration and powerful creatures, the deck can overwhelm opponents and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize."

By leveraging cards like Heliod, Sun-Crowned and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx for mana generation, the goal is to flood the board with early creatures like Thraben Inspector and Knight of the White Orchid, supported by powerful Planeswalkers like Gideon of the Trials and Gideon Blackblade. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Stasis Snare and Rest in Peace to control the opponent's resources, while also providing additional support with cards like Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit and Daxos, Blessed by the Sun."
