The key strategy is to consistently apply pressure to the opponent's life total by attacking with small, evasive creatures and finishing them off with direct damage spells. The inclusion of cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Rampaging Ferocidon amplifies the damage output, while cards like Mutavault and Ramunap Ruins provide additional sources of damage. Overall, the goal is to bring the opponent's life total to zero as quickly as possible."
