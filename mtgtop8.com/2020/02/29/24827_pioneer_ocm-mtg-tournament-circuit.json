Torbran, Thane of Red Fell boosts the damage output of all your red spells, while Rimrock Knight and Bonecrusher Giant provide additional threats. The deck also utilizes lands like Ramunap Ruins and Castle Embereth for extra reach. Overall, the key strategy is to stay on the offensive and close out games as fast as possible."
