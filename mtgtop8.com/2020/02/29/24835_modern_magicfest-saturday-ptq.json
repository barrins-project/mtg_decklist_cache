It aims to create powerful synergies and combos with cards like Yawgmoth, Thran Physician, Geralf's Messenger, and Zulaport Cutthroat to drain the opponent's life total quickly. The deck also includes resilient creatures like Young Wolf and Strangleroot Geist to apply pressure and protect key pieces. Overall, the strategy revolves around maximizing the value of creature interactions and leveraging their abilities to win the game efficiently."
