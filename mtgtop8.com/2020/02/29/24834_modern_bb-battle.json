The deck also includes disruptive tools like Spell Queller and Unsettled Mariner to control the board and keep the opponent on their back foot. Overall, this deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain tempo throughout the game."

By utilizing cards like Once Upon a Time and Explore to find key pieces like Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Dryad of the Ilysian Grove, the deck can then combo off to deal massive amounts of damage with Valakut triggers. The inclusion of cards like Vesuva and Gruul Turf help to further maximize the damage output from Valakut, creating a powerful and explosive win condition."
