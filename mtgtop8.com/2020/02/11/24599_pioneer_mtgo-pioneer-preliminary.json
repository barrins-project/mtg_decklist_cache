            "notes": "The main concept of this Dimir Inverter deck is to quickly fill the graveyard with cards using spells like Opt and Dig Through Time, then use Thassa's Oracle to win the game by drawing a card with no cards left in the library. This combo is backed up by disruption spells like Thoughtseize and counterspells like Drown in the Loch to control the game and protect the win condition. The deck also includes Jace, Wielder of Mysteries as an alternative win condition and additional card draw engine. The goal is to assemble the combo pieces and win the game efficiently."
