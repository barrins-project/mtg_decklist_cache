The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Fatal Push and Stubborn Denial, while also utilizing card selection and graveyard manipulation with cards like Mishra's Bauble and Traverse the Ulvenwald. This deck aims to win quickly by playing a hyper-aggressive strategy that punishes opponents for not being able to keep up with its tempo."
