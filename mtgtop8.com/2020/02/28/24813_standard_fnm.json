The deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a solid board presence with threats like Dream Trawler and Archon of Sun's Grace. Teferi, Time Raveler is a key card in disrupting the opponent's game plan while also providing card advantage. The deck also utilizes planeswalkers like Narset, Parter of Veils for additional card draw and control options. The overall goal is to outvalue and outlast the opponent through careful resource management."

By utilizing cards like Witch's Oven and Cauldron Familiar for recurring damage, along with powerful creatures like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Deathless Knight, the deck aims to drain the opponent's life total while maintaining a strong board presence. Additionally, cards like Rankle, Master of Pranks and Murderous Rider provide versatile options for disrupting the opponent's strategy."
