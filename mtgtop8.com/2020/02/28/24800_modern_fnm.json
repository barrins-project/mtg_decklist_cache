Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage are key creatures that can also chip in damage while providing prowess triggers. The deck also aims to refill its hand and enable more spells with cards like Light Up the Stage, Runaway Steam-Kin, and Bedlam Reveler. It's all about speed, efficiency, and relentless aggression."
