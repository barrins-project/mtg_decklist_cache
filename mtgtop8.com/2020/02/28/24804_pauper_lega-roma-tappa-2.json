The deck is heavily reliant on drawing and filtering through the deck with cards like Preordain, Brainstorm, and Ponder to find the necessary combo pieces. Additionally, protection spells like Dispel and Gigadrowse are included to help protect the combo. Seeker of the Way provides a backup win condition if the combo is disrupted. The mana base includes snow lands to enable Whiteout for additional protection."
