            "notes": "The main focus of the deck is to quickly swarm the board with low-cost creatures and use sacrifice effects to deal damage to the opponent. By using cards like Cauldron Familiar, Priest of Forgotten Gods, and Mayhem Devil, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on and gradually wear them down. Additionally, Rankle, Master of Pranks and Claim the Firstborn provide disruption and control elements to further advantage the aggressive strategy. With a good mix of creatures, sacrifice outlets, and removal, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a swift victory."
