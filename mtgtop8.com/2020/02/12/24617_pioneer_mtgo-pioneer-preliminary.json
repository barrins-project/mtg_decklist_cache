The inclusion of strong removal spells and resilient threats like Walking Ballista and Elspeth Conquers Death help to maintain board control and pressure the opponent. The deck also utilizes mana ramp and card advantage engines like Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Arcanist's Owl to ensure consistent performance and adaptability in different game situations."
