The key strategy involves playing aggressive creatures like Zhur-Taa Goblin and Gruul Spellbreaker early on, supported by cards like Atarka's Command and Embercleave to increase the damage output. Domri, Anarch of Bolas provides additional support and card advantage, while cards like Pelt Collector and Experiment One help to grow the creatures on the battlefield. The aim is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful assault."
