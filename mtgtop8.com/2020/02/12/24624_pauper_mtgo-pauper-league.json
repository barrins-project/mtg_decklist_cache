The deck also includes counterspells like Prohibit and Snap to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Prismatic Strands offers protection from combat damage. The mana base is optimized for consistency, with bounce lands like Azorius Chancery and utility lands like Mystic Sanctuary to recur important spells. Overall, the deck focuses on out-valuing and out-lasting the opponent to secure victory."
