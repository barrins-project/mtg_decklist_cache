The win condition is achieved through large, explosive spells like Expansion/Explosion and Storm's Wrath. The deck's mana base provides a balanced mix of colors to support the spells and includes some temples for added scrying."

The manabase is built to support the deck's heavy blue and white mana requirements, with Castle Ardenvale and Castle Vantress providing additional utility. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and win through incremental advantage."
