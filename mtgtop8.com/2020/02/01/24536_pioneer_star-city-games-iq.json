By using cards like Skilled Animator and Ensoul Artifact, the player can turn small artifacts into powerful threats. Cards like Shrapnel Blast and Wild Slash provide removal and reach, while cards like Aethersphere Harvester and Shadowspear can provide additional utility and evasion. The deck aims to establish a fast board presence and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
