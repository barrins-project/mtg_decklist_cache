The goal is to take advantage of flash spells and instant speed effects to outmaneuver your opponent and quickly close out the game with powerful finishers like Thassa's Oracle. The deck utilizes Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx for ramp and consistent mana production, allowing you to consistently cast your threats and disrupt your opponent's plans."
