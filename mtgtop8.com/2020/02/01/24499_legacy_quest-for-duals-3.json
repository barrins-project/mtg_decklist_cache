It heavily relies on control elements like Force of Will and Veil of Summer to protect its combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also includes tools like Cunning Wish and Intuition to search for specific cards when needed. Overall, the key strategy is to cheat massive threats into play for free while maintaining control of the game through counterspells and card selection."
