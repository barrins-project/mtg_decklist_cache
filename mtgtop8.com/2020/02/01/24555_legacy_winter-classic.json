It aims to control the board through tempo plays and card advantage, utilizing cards like Brainstorm and Ponder to find the right answers. The mana base is built to support the deck's aggressive strategy, with Wasteland helping to disrupt the opponent's mana base. The deck looks to close out the game quickly before the opponent can establish a strong board presence."
