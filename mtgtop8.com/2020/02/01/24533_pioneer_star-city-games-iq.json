The deck focuses on quickly getting creatures on the board like Bonecrusher Giant, Goblin Chainwhirler, and Goblin Rabblemaster, while also dealing direct damage with spells like Lightning Strike and Wild Slash. The inclusion of powerful cards like Glorybringer and Embercleave adds additional pressure and finishing power to the deck. The overall goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total while maintaining a strong board presence."
