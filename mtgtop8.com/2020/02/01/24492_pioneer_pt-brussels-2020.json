The deck focuses on control elements such as hand disruption and removal spells to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Card draw and selection are key to finding the combo pieces quickly while also controlling the flow of the game. The deck aims to win quickly and efficiently by executing the combo before the opponent can establish a strong board presence."

This combo relies on using Inverter of Truth to invert your library, then win by drawing a card with an empty deck. The deck contains a mix of control spells, card draw, and removal to help protect the combo pieces and disrupt your opponent's game plan. Overall, the key strategy is to set up your win condition while disrupting your opponent's strategy."

The deck aims to win the game by dealing damage as quickly as possible, utilizing cards like Bonecrusher Giant, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Monastery Swiftspear to apply pressure early on. Additionally, cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Hazoret the Fervent provide late-game reach and potential board advantage. The deck's mana base is streamlined to maximize consistency and minimize potential mana flood."

This allows for powerful late game threats such as Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to be played earlier than usual. Control elements like Perilous Vault and World Breaker are included to deal with opponent threats, while cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provide additional card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures and spells while maintaining control of the game."
