The deck aims to stall the game using cards like Shatter the Sky and Elspeth Conquers Death, while setting up card advantage with Thassa's Intervention and Omen of the Sea. The win condition comes from Dream Trawler, a hard-to-remove threat that can take over the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. The mana base is optimized for consistent access to all colors needed for spells."
