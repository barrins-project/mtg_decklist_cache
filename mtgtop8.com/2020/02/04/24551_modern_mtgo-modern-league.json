The creatures, such as Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, also help in dealing damage early on. The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze adds additional pressure on the opponent while also disrupting their game plan. Overall, the deck focuses on fast-paced aggression and finishing the game before the opponent can stabilize."
