The deck aims to disrupt opponents' strategies with cards like Merfolk Trickster and Master of Waves while also providing some protection with Kira, Great Glass-Spinner. Utilizing Aether Vial allows for creatures to be put into play at instant speed, while Spreading Seas helps to disrupt opponent's mana base. Overall, the deck focuses on tempo and aggression to overwhelm opponents."
