It includes cards that allow you to disrupt your opponent's strategy, such as countering spells with Spell Queller and bouncing creatures with Brazen Borrower. Collected Company helps you put multiple creatures on the battlefield at once, while Supreme Phantom and Empyrean Eagle pump up your spirits to make them even more threatening. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and evasive creature strategy."
