By using cards like Gryff's Boon, Ethereal Armor, and All That Glitters, the deck aims to create large threats early in the game. Cards like Karametra's Blessing and Aphemia, the Cacophony provide protection and resilience to removal spells. Sram, Senior Edificer allows for card draw when casting auras, while Hateful Eidolon can provide value when auras are destroyed. The deck aims to be fast and aggressive, putting pressure on the opponent from the start."
