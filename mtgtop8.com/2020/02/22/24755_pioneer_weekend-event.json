The deck also utilizes various ways to pump up the creatures, such as Heliod, Sun-Crowned, to make them even more threatening. The inclusion of removal spells like Stasis Snare and board wipes like Elspeth Conquers Death helps to clear the way for your creatures to attack. Additionally, the deck has some resilience with lifegain from Daxos, Blessed by the Sun and card advantage from Thraben Inspector and Arcanist's Owl."

By generating a large amount of mana from Lotus Field, the deck can cast powerful spells like Expansion / Explosion and Dig Through Time. Underworld Breach is also used as a backup plan to recycle cards from the graveyard and combo off again if necessary. The deck aims to win quickly through explosive turns and overwhelming the opponent."
