This mana is then used to play powerful colorless spells like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, Karn Liberated, and Eldrazi creatures. The deck also includes cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to help find the Tron lands efficiently. With a strong control element provided by cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Oblivion Stone, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its late-game threats."
