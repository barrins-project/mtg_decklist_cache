The goal is to stay ahead on board presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Absorb. The deck aims to stabilize the board and outvalue the opponent with card advantage through cards like Dig Through Time and Sphinx's Revelation. By controlling the game and making strategic decisions, the deck can survive long enough to win through incremental advantage or by using powerful win conditions like Elspeth, Sun's Nemesis."
