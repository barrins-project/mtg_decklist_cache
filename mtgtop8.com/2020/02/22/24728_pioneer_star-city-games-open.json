This aggressive strategy is supported by burn spells like Wild Slash and Shrapnel Blast to finish off opponents or clear the way for attacks. The inclusion of protection spells and versatile lands ensures the deck's resilience and consistency."

The deck also includes cards like Opt, Thoughtseize, and Dig Through Time to find and protect these win conditions, while disruption cards like Thought Erasure and Fatal Push help control the game until you can assemble your combo. Narset, Parter of Veils can also help dig through your deck while hindering your opponent's card draw. Overall, the strategy revolves around efficiently assembling your combo pieces and controlling the game until you can win."
