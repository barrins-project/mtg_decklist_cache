            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing counterspells, board wipes, and card advantage to control the game and outlast the opponent. By using powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset, Parter of Veils, along with threats like Dream Trawler and Elspeth Conquers Death, the deck aims to slowly grind out value and control the game until it can establish dominance. With a mix of control elements and win conditions, it seeks to outmaneuver the opponent and win through attrition and strategic play."
