It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while steadily building up resources and eventually winning through card advantage and powerful planeswalker abilities. The deck's win condition is typically through attrition and out-valuing the opponent rather than a fast aggressive strategy. It leverages powerful blue and white control cards to dictate the pace of the game and come out on top in longer matchups."
