Cards like Lightning Helix, Boros Charm, and Skullcrack provide additional reach and versatility in dealing damage, allowing the deck to finish off the opponent swiftly before they can stabilize or gain too much life."

The deck also utilizes the graveyard with cards like Traverse the Ulvenwald and Mishra's Bauble to help find key cards and enable Death's Shadow to grow even larger. By efficiently controlling the board and applying pressure early on, this deck aims to close out games quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
