The deck also includes cards like World Breaker and Walking Ballista for removal and disruption. The goal is to control the game by generating more resources and stronger threats than the opponent, ensuring victory through overwhelming power and consistency."

This allows the player to cast powerful spells such as Dig Through Time and Thassa's Oracle to win the game. The deck focuses on setting up a powerful combo quickly to overwhelm the opponent and secure a victory in a Pioneer 1 vs 1 matchup."
