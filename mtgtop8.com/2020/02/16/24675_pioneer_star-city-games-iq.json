By utilizing a mix of aggressive creatures and versatile removal spells, this deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and maintain that pressure until victory. The inclusion of Mystical Dispute and Stubborn Denial also helps protect the deck's key threats from potential removal spells or counterspells."
