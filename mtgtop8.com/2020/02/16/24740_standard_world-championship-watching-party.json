The deck aims to survive the early game with cards like The Birth of Meletis and then stabilize with sweepers like Shatter the Sky. By utilizing a mix of permission spells and card draw, the deck can outvalue opponents and eventually win with threats like Dream Trawler. The mana base supports the deck's color requirements and includes utility lands like Castle Ardenvale and Castle Vantress."
