By cheating in creatures like Griselbrand and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with big threats that can win the game in just a few turns. Additionally, the deck includes plenty of card draw and counter spells to protect its combo pieces and disrupt opponents' strategies, making it a formidable force in the Legacy format."

By using Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play and disrupt the opponent's game plan, this deck aims to keep the opponent on their back foot and control the board with cards like Swords to Plowshares. The inclusion of equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Sword of Fire and Ice provides additional threats and ways to close out games quickly."
