Dryad of the Ilysian Grove helps fix mana and turn all lands into Mountains to trigger Valakut multiple times. Search for Tomorrow, Sakura-Tribe Elder, and Arboreal Grazer provide additional ramp while Once Upon a Time helps find key pieces. Field of the Dead provides additional threats and the potential to go wide. The deck aims to win through overwhelming damage output with Valakut triggers."

By utilizing cards like Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek to generate a steady stream of tokens, the deck can quickly overwhelm opponents. With a mix of disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push, as well as versatile counterspells like Cryptic Command and Archmage's Charm, the deck aims to disrupt opponents' game plans while establishing its own board presence and ultimately outvaluing the opponent."
