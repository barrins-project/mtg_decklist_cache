By playing efficient cards like Chittering Rats, Cuombajj Witches, and Gray Merchant of Asphodel, the deck aims to drain the opponent's life total quickly. It also includes disruption in the form of cards like Reaper of Night and Chainer's Edict to handle the opponent's threats. The deck's synergy and consistency are further enhanced by card draw and card advantage provided by cards like Sign in Blood and Phyrexian Rager."
