Additionally, the deck aims to generate value from landfall triggers with cards like Risen Reef and Nissa, Who Shakes the World. Thassa, Deep-Dwelling and Agent of Treachery provide additional control elements, while cards like Cavalier of Thorns and Healer of the Glade help to stabilize the board and gain life."
