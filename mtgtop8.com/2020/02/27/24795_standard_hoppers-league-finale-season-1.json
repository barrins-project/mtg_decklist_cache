By utilizing low-cost creatures like Scorch Spitter and Fervent Champion, along with powerful cards like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, you aim to deal damage quickly and efficiently. With a focus on utilizing red mana sources, Castle Embereth acts as a utility land to boost the power of your creatures, while Light Up the Stage allows you to draw additional cards to keep up the pressure on your opponent."
