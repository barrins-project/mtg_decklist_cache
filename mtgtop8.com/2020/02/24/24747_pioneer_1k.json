Using cards like Ensoul Artifact and Skilled Animator, it can turn cheap artifacts into formidable threats. Stubborn Denial and Shrapnel Blast provide disruption and removal options, while artifacts like Ghostfire Blade and Shadowspear can enhance the effectiveness of the creatures. The deck aims to apply early pressure and quickly close out the game before the opponent can stabilize, utilizing a mix of efficient beaters and disruption spells to overpower the opponent."
