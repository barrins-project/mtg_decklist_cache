By using cards like Primeval Titan and Sakura-Tribe Elder to search for lands, as well as Dryad of the Ilysian Grove to enable multiple land drops per turn, the deck can easily reach the critical mass of mountains needed to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent. Additionally, cards like Field of the Dead provide alternate win conditions, making it a versatile and powerful combo deck in Modern 1 vs 1."
