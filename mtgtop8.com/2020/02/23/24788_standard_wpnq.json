Supporting these creatures are burn spells like Bonecrusher Giant and Embercleave to further pressure the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell enhances the deck's ability to maintain a threatening board presence. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast-paced aggression and powerful combat tricks."
