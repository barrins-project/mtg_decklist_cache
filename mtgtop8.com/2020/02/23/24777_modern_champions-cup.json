It focuses on utilizing low-cost, efficient creatures like Goblin Guide, Monastery Swiftspear, and Eidolon of the Great Revel to apply pressure and force the opponent to react. The deck also includes a wide range of burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Lava Spike to deal direct damage to the opponent and control the board. Additionally, cards like Searing Blaze and Skullcrack are included to disrupt opposing strategies and prevent the opponent from gaining life or stabilizing."
