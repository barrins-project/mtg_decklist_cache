These creatures work well with other cards like Mayhem Devil and Priest of Forgotten Gods to create repetitive value and chip away at the opponent's life total. By utilizing sacrifice effects with cards like Woe Strider and Witch's Oven, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's board while maintaining a steady flow of card advantage. Additionally, Rankle, Master of Pranks provides disruptive abilities and Rix Maadi Reveler helps replenish the hand when needed."
