Using powerful creatures like Hydroid Krasis and Uro to generate card advantage and pressure the opponent, while also having access to threats like Brazen Borrower and Bonecrusher Giant for tempo swings. The deck also includes ramp spells like Growth Spiral and Nissa, Who Shakes the World to accelerate mana production and cast big spells earlier. Overall, the goal is to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through a combination of control elements and powerful threats."
