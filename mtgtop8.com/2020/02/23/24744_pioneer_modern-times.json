The mana base is designed to support the artifacts theme, with plenty of color-fixing and utility lands to ensure a consistent mana base for the fast-paced aggro strategy."

It uses a combination of removal spells like Cast Out and Final Payment to deal with threats. The deck also employs cards like Tymaret Calls the Dead and Doom Foretold to generate advantage over time. The win condition comes from cards like Treacherous Blessing and Aphemia, the Cacophony, which provide card advantage and create a constant stream of threats. The deck's mana base is designed to support its control strategy while maintaining consistency."
