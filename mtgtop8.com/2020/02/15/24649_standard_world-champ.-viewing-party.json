The goal is to deal damage quickly and efficiently, utilizing cards like Castle Embereth and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell to increase the power of our creatures. Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Bonecrusher Giant provide resilience and removal options, while Embercleave serves as a powerful finisher. Using cards like Light Up the Stage and Robber of the Rich, this deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent and secure victory before they have a chance to stabilize."
