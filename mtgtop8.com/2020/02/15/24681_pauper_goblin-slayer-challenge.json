By utilizing counterspells, bounce effects, and card draw, the deck aims to control the pace of the game and slowly grind out advantages over time. The inclusion of snow-covered lands and synergistic cards like Spellstutter Sprite and Ninja of the Deep Hours give the deck flexibility and a powerful late-game plan. Mystic Sanctuary and Tragic Lesson provide additional value by recurring important spells from the graveyard."
