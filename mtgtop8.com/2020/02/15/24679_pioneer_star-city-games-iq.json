Through a combination of card draw, disruption, and removal spells, the deck aims to manipulate the order of the library to then win the game by using Thassa's Oracle's ability to win if enough cards are in the library. This strategy requires careful planning and sequencing of spells, as well as knowledge of the opponent's deck and potential answers. The deck focuses on controlling the game until it can assemble the combo to secure the win."
