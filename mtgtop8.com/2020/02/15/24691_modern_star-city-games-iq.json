It ramps up to use Through the Breach to cheat in Emrakul, the Aeons Torn for a quick win. The inclusion of Snapcaster Mage allows for flexibility and reusability of key spells. The mana base is designed for consistency and to allow for the colors needed for the spells in the deck. The overall strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up to bring out a powerful creature to close out the game."
