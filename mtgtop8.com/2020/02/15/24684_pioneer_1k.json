Additionally, Jace, Wielder of Mysteries serves as an alternative win condition if needed. The deck aims to control the game while searching for the combo pieces to secure a win."

The deck aims to outvalue your opponent with efficient creatures and planeswalkers like Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Nissa, Who Shakes the World, ultimately leading to a win condition with threats like Emrakul, the Promised End or incremental advantage with Tireless Tracker and Courser of Kruphix."
