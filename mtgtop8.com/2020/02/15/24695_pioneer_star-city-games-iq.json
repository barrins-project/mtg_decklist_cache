By using cards like Ensoul Artifact and Ghostfire Blade, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures like Gingerbrute and Hangarback Walker. With access to both red and blue mana sources, the deck can efficiently cast its spells and utilize its artifact synergies to pressure the opponent and secure a fast victory."
