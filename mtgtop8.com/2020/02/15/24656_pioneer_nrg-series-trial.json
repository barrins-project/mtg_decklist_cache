The deck aims to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent with flying creatures, supported by cards like Rattlechains and Empyrean Eagle. The inclusion of Collected Company allows the deck to efficiently dig for more creatures and maintain a strong board position. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent casting of spells."

The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, eventually overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats like Emrakul, the Promised End and Walking Ballista. By utilizing a mix of disruption, card advantage, and powerful threats, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent in a long game."
