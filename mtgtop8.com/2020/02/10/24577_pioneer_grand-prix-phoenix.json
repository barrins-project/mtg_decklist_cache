The creatures are augmented by cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Rampaging Ferocidon to increase damage output. The deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain it through the mid to late game, using a mix of creatures and burn spells to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
