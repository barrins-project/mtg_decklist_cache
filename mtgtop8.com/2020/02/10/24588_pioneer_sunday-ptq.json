Hashep Oasis provides additional combat tricks, while the mana base allows for consistent access to both black and green mana."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressive strategies using efficient creatures like Lovestruck Beast, Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and Reality Smasher to put pressure on the opponent. Stubborn Denial provides protection for key threats, while cards like Llanowar Elves and Elvish Mystic help ramp into bigger threats quickly. The mana base is designed to support the Simic color combination, with a mix of lands that provide both blue and green sources. Overall, this deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain a strong board presence throughout the game."
