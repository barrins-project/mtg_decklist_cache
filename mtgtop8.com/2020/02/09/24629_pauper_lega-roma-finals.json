The goal is to generate a large board presence quickly and efficiently by using cards like Thoughtcast and Prophetic Prism to draw more cards and keep the pressure on the opponent. With access to burn spells like Galvanic Blast and combat tricks like Temur Battle Rage and Fling, the deck can deal a lot of damage in a short amount of time, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize."
