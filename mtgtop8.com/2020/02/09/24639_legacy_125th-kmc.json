Chalice of the Void and Thorn of Amethyst help disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Eldrazi Displacer and Walking Ballista provide versatility and removal options. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain board control throughout the game with its aggressive creature base and disruptive spells."
