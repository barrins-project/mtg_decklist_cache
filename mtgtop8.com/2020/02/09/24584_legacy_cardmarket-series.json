Cards like Gilded Goose, Cavern Harpy, and Shardless Agent help the player achieve this by providing ways to continuously cast creatures from their hand. Additionally, the deck includes control elements like Force of Will and Abrupt Decay to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's strategy. By assembling the Aluren combo and out-valuing the opponent, this deck seeks to win the game through overwhelming advantage on the battlefield."

It aims to establish early board presence with creatures like Delver of Secrets and Young Pyromancer, while protecting them with cards like Force of Will and Daze. The deck also utilizes tempo plays with cards like Dreadhorde Arcanist and True-Name Nemesis to apply pressure on opponents. Furthermore, it leverages its mana denial strategy with Wasteland to disrupt opponents' mana bases and keep them off balance."
