The deck aims to manipulate the board state with cards like Shatter the Sky and Elspeth Conquers Death, while also generating card advantage with Narset, Parter of Veils and Omen of the Sea. The win condition of the deck is to eventually play Dream Trawler, a powerful threat that can close out the game while providing card advantage and protection."
