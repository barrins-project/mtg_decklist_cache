Dream Trawler serves as a win condition by providing a way to close out the game while protecting itself. The deck's strategy revolves around controlling the board, drawing cards, and resolving powerful threats to eventually win the game."

The deck also includes a variety of planeswalkers and enchantments to generate card advantage and provide additional control tools.
