By using cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push to disrupt the opponent's resources and threats, along with cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Nissa, Who Shakes the World to generate constant value, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and win the game through attrition. The deck also utilizes key creatures like Ishkanah, Grafwidow and Emrakul, the Promised End to close out games efficiently."
