            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game through powerful planeswalkers and board clearing spells, while utilizing Fires of Invention to cast multiple spells each turn. The deck aims to stall the opponent's threats with counterspells and removal until the planeswalkers can take over the game and secure the victory. By utilizing Teferi, Time Raveler to shut down opponents' instant spells and activating Fae of Wishes to pull key sideboard cards, the deck is able to adapt to different matchups and come out on top."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on generating a large number of small, aggressive creatures quickly to overwhelm the opponent. It also utilizes enchantments and artifacts to control the board and protect its creatures. The main win condition is to pump up these small creatures with Heliod, Sun-Crowned and other support cards to deal massive damage to the opponent. The deck also includes some higher cost cards for late-game impact and resilience. Overall, the strategy is to maintain a constant pressure on the opponent while gradually building up a lethal board presence."
