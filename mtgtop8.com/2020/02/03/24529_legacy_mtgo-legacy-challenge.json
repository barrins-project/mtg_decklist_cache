The key strategy is to generate value by recurring artifacts from the graveyard and creating tokens with Thopter Foundry while also using powerful planeswalkers like Karn, the Great Creator and Oko, Thief of Crowns to control the board and provide additional threats. The mana base is designed to support the artifact theme and enable a fast start with powerful mana acceleration."
