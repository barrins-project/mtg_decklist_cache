The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of elves and use Timberwatch Elf to pump them up for a lethal attack. The inclusion of Essence Warden helps to gain life and stall against aggressive decks, while Lys Alana Huntmaster provides additional token generation for even more pressure. The deck is designed to be fast, efficient, and resilient against removal."
