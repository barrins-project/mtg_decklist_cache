The key strategy is to flood the board with creatures like Scorch Spitter and Fervent Champion, while using burn spells like Shock and Infuriate to remove threats or target the opponent directly. The deck also utilizes cards like Castle Embereth and Embercleave to give creatures additional power and haste, enabling them to deal massive damage and close out the game quickly. Additionally, cards like Light Up the Stage and Phoenix of Ash provide card advantage and resilience in longer games."
