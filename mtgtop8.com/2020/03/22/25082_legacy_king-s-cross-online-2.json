            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to use aggressive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Dreadhorde Arcanist, along with cheap burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, to quickly deal damage to the opponent. The deck also includes countermagic like Force of Will and Daze to protect its threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, cards like Brainstorm and Ponder help to smooth out draws and find key cards. The mana base is built to support the deck's aggressive game plan while also providing some flexibility with cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Brazen Borrower."
