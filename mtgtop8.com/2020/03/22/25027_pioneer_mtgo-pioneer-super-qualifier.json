These threats are able to control the board and overwhelm the opponent with their strong abilities and high stats. The deck's goal is to outvalue and outpace the opponent by quickly ramping into its big threats and establishing a dominant board presence. Additionally, cards like Tamiyo and Satyr Wayfinder provide card advantage and help ensure a steady stream of threats throughout the game."
