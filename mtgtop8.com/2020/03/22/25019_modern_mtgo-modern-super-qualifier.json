The deck also utilizes Karn, the Great Creator to answer opponent's threats and disrupt their game plan. By efficiently ramping and assembling the right pieces, the deck can set up a win condition with Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Primeval Titan's landfall triggers."

The creatures in the deck have abilities that help trigger prowess and deal additional damage. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and aggressive strategy, using cards like Bedlam Reveler and Monastery Swiftspear to maintain card advantage and increase the deck's velocity. The inclusion of Fiery Islet and Sunbaked Canyon provides additional card draw and mana fixing to keep the pressure on the opponent."
