By utilizing cards like Supreme Verdict, Force of Negation, and Teferi, Time Raveler, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while generating card advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The inclusion of Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides additional card advantage and lifegain, while Ice-Fang Coatl provides early-game defense and card draw. The mana base is optimized with fetch lands and snow lands to support the deck's triple color requirements."
