The inclusion of cards like Gideon of the Trials and Elspeth Conquers Death provide additional versatility and resilience to the deck. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells."

            "notes": "This aggressive red deck focuses on quickly dealing damage to the opponent through a combination of efficient creatures and burn spells. By utilizing low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage alongside burn spells like Lightning Strike and Wild Slash, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and close out the game before they can stabilize. The inclusion of powerful threats like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Goblin Rabblemaster provides additional reach and staying power in longer games. The deck also benefits from the utility of Ramunap Ruins and Castle Embereth to push through the final points of damage."
