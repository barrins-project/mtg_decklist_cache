It includes cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Heliod, Sun-Crowned to provide additional support and buffs to the creatures. The deck also includes removal spells like Stasis Snare to deal with any threats from the opponent. The goal is to establish a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure throughout the game to secure a quick victory."
