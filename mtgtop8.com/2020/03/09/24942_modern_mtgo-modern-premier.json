The deck leverages card advantage from cards like Snapcaster Mage and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to outvalue opponents. Ice-Fang Coatl provides early game defense while also drawing cards. The deck aims to control the board with removal like Path to Exile and sweepers like Supreme Verdict, while also fixing mana with Arcum's Astrolabe and disrupting opponents with Field of Ruin."
