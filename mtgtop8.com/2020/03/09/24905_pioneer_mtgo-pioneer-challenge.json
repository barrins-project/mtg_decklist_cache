By playing aggressive creatures like Empyrean Eagle, Mausoleum Wanderer, and Supreme Phantom, the deck aims to deal damage rapidly while using disruption cards like Spell Queller to control the opponent's plays. Collected Company allows for additional creatures to be played at instant speed, helping maintain tempo and pressure. The mana base supports the deck's color requirements for consistent plays. Overall, the deck is built to apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game."
