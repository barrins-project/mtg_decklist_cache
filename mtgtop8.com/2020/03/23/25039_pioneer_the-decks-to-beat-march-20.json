By combining aggressive creatures like Stonecoil Serpent and Gingerbrute with artifacts that enhance their power, such as Ghostfire Blade and Steel Overseer, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and efficient attacks. The inclusion of cards like Bomat Courier and Shrapnel Blast also provides additional reach and removal options, making it a versatile and aggressive archetype."
