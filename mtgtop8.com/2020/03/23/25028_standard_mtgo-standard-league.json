Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger serves as a powerful finisher, punishing the opponent for discarding cards and dealing direct damage. Lazav, the Multifarious adds flexibility and utility to the deck, allowing for various synergies and combos to be executed."

Fae of Wishes allows for versatile sideboard options, while Escape to the Wilds provides card selection and additional resources. The deck also includes limited removal and disruption elements for flexibility in different matchups."
