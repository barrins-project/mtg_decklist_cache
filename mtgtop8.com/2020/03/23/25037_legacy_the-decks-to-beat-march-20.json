The deck also includes various cantrips and card draw spells to help dig through the deck and find the necessary combo pieces. The inclusion of Veil of Summer helps protect the combo from disruption and Thoughtseize can be used to strip away key cards from the opponent's hand. The deck aims to win quickly through a storm combo."
