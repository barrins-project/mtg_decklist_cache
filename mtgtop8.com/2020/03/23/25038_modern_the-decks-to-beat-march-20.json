Cards like Urza, Lord High Artificer and Thopter Foundry provide a strong engine for generating tokens and mana, while cards like Whir of Invention and Cryptic Command help control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes cards like Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Mishra's Bauble to recur important artifacts and keep the engine running smoothly. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind out wins through powerful synergies and control elements."
