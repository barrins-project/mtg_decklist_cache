Using a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and planeswalkers, it aims to slow down the opponent's game plan and establish a strong board presence. The deck also includes a few win conditions in the form of Dream Trawler and Archon of Sun's Grace, allowing it to close out the game once it has stabilized. The mana base supports the control strategy by providing consistent access to both white and blue mana sources."

The Simic colors provide a good balance of creature power and spell control, allowing the deck to maintain pressure on the opponent while protecting its own resources. This deck aims to quickly establish board presence with creatures like Frilled Mystic and Nightpack Ambusher, supported by cards like Sinister Sabotage and Quench to counter any threats the opponent plays. The inclusion of cards like Brazen Borrower and Unsummon further adds to the disruptive game plan of the deck."
