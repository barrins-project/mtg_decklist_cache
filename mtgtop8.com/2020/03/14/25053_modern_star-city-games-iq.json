Additionally, the deck utilizes powerful creatures like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Ice-Fang Coatl to generate card advantage and pressure the opponent. The inclusion of equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine provides additional threats and utility. Overall, the deck seeks to outvalue the opponent and dictate the pace of the game."

By combining powerful threats like Kroxa and Stoneforge Mystic with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining a strong board presence. Additionally, cards like Lingering Souls and Seasoned Pyromancer provide additional value and card advantage. The inclusion of equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine and Batterskull allows for additional reach and resilience in combat situations."
