By playing efficient creatures like Gruul Spellbreaker, Questing Beast, and Robber of the Rich, along with buffs like Embercleave and Collision / Colossus, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Castle Embereth provide additional value and resilience, while cards like Domri's Ambush and Bonecrusher Giant help control the board and remove threats. The main goal is to apply pressure early and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
