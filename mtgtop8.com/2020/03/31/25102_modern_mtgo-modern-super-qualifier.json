The deck includes cards like Lotus Bloom and Pentad Prism to ramp up mana quickly, as well as cards like Spoils of the Vault to search for key combo pieces. Phyrexian Unlife can help to stall the game until the combo is assembled. The deck is designed to be fast and consistent in executing its win condition."
