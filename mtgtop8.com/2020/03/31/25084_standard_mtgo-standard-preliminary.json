The deck aims to establish a strong board presence with cards like Nightpack Ambusher and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and eventually finish off the opponent with cards like Expansion / Explosion. The deck also includes card draw and scrying effects to ensure consistency in drawing the necessary cards to maintain control of the game."
