            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing low-cost, evasive spirits to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a burst of flying damage. By using cards like Collected Company and Curious Obsession, the deck can maintain card advantage and pressure the opponent's board while protecting its own creatures with cards like Spell Queller and Selfless Spirit. The inclusion of Supreme Phantom boosts the power of all spirits in the deck, making it easier to close out the game quickly by flying over the opponent's defenses. The deck's mana base is designed to support its aggressive spirit creatures while maintaining consistency in its color requirements."
