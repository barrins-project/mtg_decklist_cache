The deck aims to assemble its combo pieces efficiently while playing around disruption from the opponent to ensure a smooth and explosive win condition."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on mana ramp with artifacts and land fetch, controlling the board with counterspells and removal, and generating card advantage through Urza's abilities and Emry's recursion. The strategy is to stabilize the board early, ramp into powerful threats like Uro and Urza, and control the game until victory. The deck's synergy between artifacts, Urza, and Uro allows for efficient resource management and powerful plays in the mid to late game. Use resources wisely, disrupt opponent's game plan, and leverage card advantage to outvalue your opponent and secure the win."
