By manipulating your library with cards like Jace, Wielder of Mysteries and Dig Through Time, and disrupting your opponent's game plan with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Thought Erasure, you aim to set up a winning board state while controlling the game. The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Hero's Downfall to deal with opposing threats, making it a versatile and strategic deck choice in Pioneer 1 vs 1 format."
