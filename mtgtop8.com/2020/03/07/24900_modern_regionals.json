The main goal is to cast Primeval Titan as soon as possible to fetch powerful lands like Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Tolaria West. This allows for massive damage potential and the ability to search for any needed answers with cards like Once Upon a Time and Pact of Negation. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a quick and powerful land-based strategy."
