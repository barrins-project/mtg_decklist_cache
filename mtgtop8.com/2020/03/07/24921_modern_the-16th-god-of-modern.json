It aims to stall the game and establish dominance with powerful planeswalkers like Teferi and Jace. The deck also includes ways to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Force of Negation and Shadow of Doubt. By efficiently managing threats and resources, the deck looks to outvalue the opponent and win the game through incremental advantage."
