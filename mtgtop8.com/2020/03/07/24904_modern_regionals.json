            "notes": "This Bant Control deck focuses on using a combination of counterspells, removal, and powerful planeswalkers to control the game and outvalue the opponent. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Mana Leak, Force of Negation, and Cryptic Command, while also generating card advantage with cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The inclusion of Sword of Feast and Famine and Batterskull provides additional win conditions and life gain, while Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Ice-Fang Coatl help stabilize the board and generate value. The manabase is built around efficiently casting spells and utilizing cards like Arcum's Astrolabe to fix mana."

Bedlam Reveler provides card advantage and additional threats in the mid to late game, while cards like Crash Through and Light Up the Stage help keep the deck running smoothly and efficiently.
