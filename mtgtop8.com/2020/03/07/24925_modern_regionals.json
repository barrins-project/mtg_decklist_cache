The deck also uses utility lands like Bojuka Bog and Field of the Dead to control the board and outvalue the opponent.

It aims to stall the game until it can establish a dominant board presence with powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine and Batterskull. The deck uses a combination of card advantage, efficient removal spells, and powerful finishers to out-value and out-maneuver the opponent, ultimately overwhelming them with a combination of threats and disruption."
