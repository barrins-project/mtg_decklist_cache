At the same time, the deck aims to accelerate its own mana production with Utopia Sprawl and Arbor Elf to quickly ramp into powerful threats like Inferno Titan, Carnage Tyrant, and Questing Beast. Additionally, the deck has a combo finish with Madcap Experiment and Platinum Emperion to create a nearly unbeatable board state."
