It aims to disrupt the opponent's hand with Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, counter spells with Cryptic Command, and remove threats with Fatal Push and Drown in the Loch. Bitterblossom provides a constant stream of Faerie tokens, while cards like Spellstutter Sprite and Vendilion Clique help control the board. The deck also utilizes snow lands for additional synergy with cards like Arcum's Astrolabe and Mystic Sanctuary."
