The main win condition revolves around creating an infinite loop with Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek, or taking extra turns with Time Sieve. Urza, Lord High Artificer provides extra mana and card advantage, while Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas and Whir of Invention find key pieces and control the board. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and outvalue the opponent until it can set up a win condition."
