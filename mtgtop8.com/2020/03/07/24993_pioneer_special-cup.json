The deck utilizes a combination of removal spells, hand disruption, and graveyard recursion to control the game. Cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push help to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Emrakul, the Promised End provide powerful late-game threats. The deck's mana base is designed to support a variety of colors, allowing for flexibility in playing different spells and adapting to different matchups."
