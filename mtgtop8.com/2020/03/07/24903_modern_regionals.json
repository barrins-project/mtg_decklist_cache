This allows the player to eventually set up a combo with Thassa's Oracle or Grinding Station to win the game. Teferi, Time Raveler is used to protect the combo and disrupt opponents, while cards like Thoughtseize and Cryptic Command provide additional control and disruption. The deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and win the game before the opponent can react effectively."

The deck aims to dig through the library with cantrips such as Opt and Sleight of Hand to find key combo pieces like Gifts Ungiven and Past in Flames. Ultimately, the deck looks to storm off and cast a lethal Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens to overwhelm the opponent and win the game in one explosive turn."
