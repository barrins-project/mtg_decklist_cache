This allows the player to cast multiple spells in a turn, leading to a powerful combo finish using cards like Gifts Ungiven, Past in Flames, and Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens. The deck aims to win the game quickly by creating a storm of spells to overwhelm the opponent's defenses and deal lethal damage in a single turn."

It uses cards like Dryad of the Ilysian Grove and Sakura-Tribe Elder to accelerate land drops and search for the necessary combo pieces. The goal is to get Valakut online as soon as possible while controlling the board with cards like Bojuka Bog and Ghost Quarter. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful land triggers and efficiently combo off for the win."
