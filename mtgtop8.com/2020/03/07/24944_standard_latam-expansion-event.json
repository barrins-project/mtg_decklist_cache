Uro helps to gain life and draw cards, while Expansion / Explosion provides a win condition and more utility. The deck aims to outvalue opponents by generating card advantage and efficiently dealing with threats, ultimately overwhelming them with powerful spells and maintaining control of the game. Thassa's Intervention and Gadwick, the Wizened provide additional ways to manipulate the board and gain advantage."
