            "notes": "The main strategy of this Temur Control deck is to establish early game control through cards like Wilderness Reclamation and Growth Spiral, then maintain it with counterspells like Negate and Mystical Dispute. The deck also includes removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire and board wipes like Storm's Wrath to deal with threats. The deck's win condition is usually to generate a large amount of mana to cast a massive Expansion / Explosion or to outvalue the opponent with cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can secure a victory."
