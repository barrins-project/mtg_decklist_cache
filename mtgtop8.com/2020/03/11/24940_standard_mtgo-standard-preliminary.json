By utilizing cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Deafening Clarion to disrupt and control the opponent's strategy, the deck aims to reach its win conditions with powerful finishers like Cavalier of Flame and Kenrith, the Returned King. The deck also includes card draw and manipulation elements to maintain consistency and adapt to different situations."
