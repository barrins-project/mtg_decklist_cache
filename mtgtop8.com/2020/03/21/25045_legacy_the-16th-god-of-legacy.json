This allows the player to cast creatures for free and generate value from their enters-the-battlefield abilities, creating a powerful interactive game plan. The deck also includes disruption in the form of counterspells and removal spells to control the game and protect the combo. Additionally, the deck features versatile planeswalkers like Oko who can provide additional value and disruption. Ultimately, the key concept of the deck is to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through efficient combo pieces and interactive spells."

The inclusion of cards like Unmask and Thoughtseize allows for disruption of the opponent's strategy, while cards like Collective Brutality provide additional versatility. Ultimately, the goal is to reanimate a powerful creature and win the game quickly."

The deck also focuses on disrupting the opponent with cards like Blood Moon, Ensnaring Bridge, and Sorcerous Spyglass, while utilizing cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Goblin Welder for additional utility. The deck also includes strong removal and interaction cards like Pyroblast and Red Elemental Blast to control the game and protect the combo."
