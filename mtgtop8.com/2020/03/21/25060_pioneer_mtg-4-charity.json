The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push, while also providing card advantage and flexibility with cards like Opt, Discovery / Dispersal, and Quicken. The deck then closes out the game with powerful threats like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger, Nicol Bolas, the Ravager, and Bonecrusher Giant. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's tri-color requirements."
