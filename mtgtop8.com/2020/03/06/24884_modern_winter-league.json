The deck focuses on cards like Temporal Mastery, Time Warp, and Part the Waterveil to gain additional turns, allowing the player to set up a winning board state or overwhelm the opponent. Cards such as Dictate of Kruphix and Search for Azcanta help to accelerate card draw and maintain resources. Additionally, anti-interaction cards like Silence and Teferi, Time Raveler provide protection and disruption to the opponent's game plan."
