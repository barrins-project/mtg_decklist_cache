The deck also focuses on card advantage and card selection, using cards like Thassa's Intervention, Gadwick, the Wizened, and Omen of the Sea. The win condition of the deck is through card draw and burn damage, especially with the card Expansion / Explosion. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent to secure victory."
