By utilizing low-cost creatures like Knight of the Ebon Legion and Bloodsoaked Champion, along with powerful cards like Rankle, Master of Pranks and Murderous Rider, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain board control throughout the game. With cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push providing additional disruption, the deck is designed to be proactive and aggressive, forcing opponents to react to its threats."
