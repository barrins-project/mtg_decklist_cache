By using cards like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push to disrupt the opponent's plans and creatures like Spawn of Mayhem and Knight of the Ebon Legion to pressure their life total, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize. Additionally, cards like Scrapheap Scrounger provide resilience against removal spells, allowing the deck to maintain a consistent and aggressive strategy throughout the game."
