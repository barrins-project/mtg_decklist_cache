By constantly sacrificing Cauldron Familiar and other creatures to Witch's Oven and Priest of Forgotten Gods, you can deal damage to your opponent with Mayhem Devil and trigger powerful abilities. Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger serves as a disruptive threat that can be easily brought back from the graveyard. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly with a combination of creature sacrifice and direct damage."
