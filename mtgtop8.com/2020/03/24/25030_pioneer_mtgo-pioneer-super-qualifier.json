This is achieved through cards like Hidden Strings, Vizier of Tumbling Sands, Fae of Wishes, and Sylvan Scrying to search for Lotus Field and other necessary pieces. Once Lotus Field is in play, the deck aims to take advantage of the massive amount of mana it produces to cast powerful spells quickly and overwhelm the opponent. Additionally, the deck includes synergies with Underworld Breach to recur key spells and maintain tempo."
