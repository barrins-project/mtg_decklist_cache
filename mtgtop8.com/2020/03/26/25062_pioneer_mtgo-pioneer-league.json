By consistently removing threats and disrupting their hand, you can buy time to establish your own board presence with powerful creatures like Questing Beast and Ishkanah, Grafwidow. The inclusion of cards like Emrakul, the Promised End and Distended Mindbender allows you to seize control of the game in the late stages, while cards like Nissa, Who Shakes the World provide additional ramp and card advantage to stay ahead of your opponent."
