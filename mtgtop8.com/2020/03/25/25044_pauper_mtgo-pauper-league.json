The deck also includes card draw options like Sign in Blood to maintain hand advantage. With a mix of creatures and removal, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive strategy and efficient removal spells."

The deck focuses on playing efficient creatures like Seeker of the Way and Guardian of the Guildpact, while also using combat tricks and removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Journey to Nowhere to control the board. The deck also includes token generation cards like Battle Screech to go wide and apply pressure. Overall, the deck aims to maintain a strong board presence and close out the game quickly through attacking and burn spells."
