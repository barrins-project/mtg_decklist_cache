            "notes": "This deck focuses on controlling the game through counterspells, removal, and card draw, while ramping up mana with Wilderness Reclamation and Growth Spiral. It aims to outvalue the opponent by utilizing powerful spells like Expansion/Explosion and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, while keeping the board clear with targeted removal like Scorching Dragonfire and Storm's Wrath. The deck also incorporates a small land advantage package with Fabled Passage and Castle Vantress to maintain card advantage and ensure consistent mana production. The key idea is to outlast and outplay the opponent through strategic decision-making and resource management."
