The deck then uses card draw and recursion to maintain card advantage and control the battlefield. Its win condition is locking the opponent out of combat with Stonehorn Dignitary and overwhelming them with card advantage and powerful spells. The key strategy is to efficiently ramp up mana and control the game until victory is secured."

Lightning Bolt and other burn spells provide additional reach and removal, ensuring that the opponent can't stabilize and take over the game. The deck aims to win quickly and decisively before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
