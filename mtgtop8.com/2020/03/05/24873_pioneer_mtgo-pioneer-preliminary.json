By using cards like Stasis Snare to remove threats and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx to generate large amounts of mana, this deck can quickly establish control of the battlefield and push for a swift victory. With a focus on efficient creatures and a mana ramp engine, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
