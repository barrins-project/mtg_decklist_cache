The deck aims to maintain card advantage through efficient spells like Opt and Snapcaster Mage, while also utilizing Stoneforge Mystic to tutor up powerful equipment such as Batterskull and Sword of Feast and Famine. The inclusion of cards like Spell Queller and Spell Snare allows for additional disruption, while cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Time Raveler provide powerful card advantage and tempo advantage."
