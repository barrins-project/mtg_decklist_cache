By efficiently managing your threats and answers, you can outlast and outmaneuver your opponent until you can close out the game with powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Elspeth, Sun's Nemesis. The deck also utilizes Mystic Sanctuary to recur important spells and Castle Ardenvale to create tokens for defense or offense. Overall, the goal is to maintain control of the game and win through attrition."
