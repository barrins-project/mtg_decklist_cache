The deck focuses on board presence and direct damage, putting pressure on the opponent early in the game with powerful creatures like Legion Warboss, Kari Zev, and Goblin Rabblemaster. The inclusion of burn spells like Lightning Strike and creatures with enter-the-battlefield abilities like Bonecrusher Giant also provides versatility in dealing with threats and maintaining a strong offense. The deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
