By constantly dredging cards and bringing them back from the graveyard, the deck can quickly overwhelm opponents with a swarm of creatures. Cards like Creeping Chill provide direct damage to the opponent, while Conflagrate can finish off the game by dealing damage based on the number of cards in the graveyard. The key strategy is to constantly fill and utilize the graveyard to create a powerful board presence and win condition."

This strategy enables you to bring back creatures like Narcomoeba and Prized Amalgam from the graveyard, while also increasing your life total with Creeping Chill. Life from the Loam allows you to continuously return lands from the graveyard to your hand, providing you with additional resources. Conflagrate and Ox of Agonas provide additional reach and card advantage, making this deck a powerful and resilient combo archetype."

The deck also includes cards like Reckless Bushwhacker and Hidden Herbalists for explosive starts and Tarmogoyf for additional mid-game threats. Klothys, God of Destiny provides both disruption and a clock against control decks. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistency and speed, with fetch lands and a mix of shock lands and basic lands for color fixing."
