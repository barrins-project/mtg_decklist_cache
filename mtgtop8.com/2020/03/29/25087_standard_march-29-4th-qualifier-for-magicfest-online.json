The goal is to control the board with mass manipulation spells like Agent of Treachery and Cavalier of Thorns, while using Jace, Wielder of Mysteries as a win condition by drawing out the opponent's deck. The deck also includes cards like Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner for card draw and Castle Vantress for additional control options."
