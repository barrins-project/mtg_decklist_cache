By utilizing cards like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger, Mayhem Devil, and Cauldron Familiar with Witch's Oven and Claim the Firstborn, the deck can generate incremental value and chip away at the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Tymaret Calls the Dead and Woe Strider provide additional recursion and sacrifice outlets to maintain board presence and apply pressure. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently."

By combining cards like Claim the Firstborn, Witch's Oven, Priest of Forgotten Gods, and Mayhem Devil with powerful creatures like Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger and Woe Strider, the deck aims to keep pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan. The synergy between sacrificing creatures and triggering abilities creates a fast-paced, aggressive playstyle that can overwhelm opponents quickly."

By playing low-cost creatures like Scorch Spitter and Fervent Champion, along with powerful equipment like Embercleave, the deck aims to deal large amounts of damage early in the game. Torbran, Thane of Red Fell enhances the damage output of all red sources, while cards like Light Up the Stage provide card advantage. The goal is to maintain pressure on the opponent and finish them off before they can stabilize."
