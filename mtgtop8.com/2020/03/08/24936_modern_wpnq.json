By casting Angel's Grace, the player ensures they cannot lose the game that turn and then uses Thassa's Oracle to win through its \"win the game\" ability triggered by having zero or less cards in the library.

By leveraging cards like Teferi, Time Raveler and Narset, Parter of Veils to slow down the opponent's plays, along with efficient removal spells like Path to Exile and Supreme Verdict, this deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent over time. The deck also utilizes card advantage engines like Snapcaster Mage and Mystic Sanctuary to maintain a steady stream of resources and eventually close out the game with powerful finishers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Celestial Colonnade."
