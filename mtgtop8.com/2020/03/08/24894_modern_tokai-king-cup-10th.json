The key is to generate as much mana as possible through the use of bounce lands and multiple land drops per turn, allowing for explosive plays and the ability to search for key pieces with cards like Once Upon a Time and Tolaria West. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and powerful board presence while also having the flexibility to interact with opposing strategies through cards like Pact of Negation and Engineered Explosives."

With this mana, the deck aims to control the game with powerful planeswalkers like Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, as well as big threats like Emrakul, the Promised End and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The deck also includes removal spells like Oblivion Stone and All Is Dust to handle opposing threats. The goal is to overpower the opponent with big creatures and powerful spells supported by the UrzaTron lands."
