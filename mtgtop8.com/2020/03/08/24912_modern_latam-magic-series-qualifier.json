Additionally, cards like Chalice of the Void and Karn, the Great Creator provide disruption and further control over the game. The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the match with its aggressive playstyle."

The key strategy is to use cards like Heritage Druid and Elvish Archdruid to generate tons of mana, then use Collected Company to put even more Elves on the battlefield. Shaman of the Pack can finish off the opponent with drain effects, while cards like Beast Whisperer and Elvish Visionary provide card draw to keep the engine running smoothly."
