Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a valuable companion to bring back key creatures from the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of cycling, damage output, and creature aggression."

The inclusion of cards like Dirge Bat and Murderous Rider provide additional removal options to help maintain control of the battlefield."
