Cards like Embercleave and Castle Embereth provide additional ways to push through damage and close out games. With a focus on speed, direct damage, and powerful creatures, this deck aims to take control of the game early and maintain pressure on the opponent."

Additionally, cards like Light Up the Stage and Castle Embereth help maintain card advantage and pump up the creatures for maximum damage output. Overall, this deck is designed to apply constant pressure and end the game as quickly as possible."
