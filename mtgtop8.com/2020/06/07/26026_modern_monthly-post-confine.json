The deck aims to quickly and efficiently remove threats from the opponent's side of the battlefield using cards like Path to Exile and Caustic Caterpillar, while also deploying powerful threats of its own like Mirran Crusader and Voice of Resurgence. The inclusion of cards like Ranger-Captain of Eos and Aven Mindcensor further disrupts the opponent's strategy, denying them important resources or limiting their ability to search their library. This aggressive and disruptive playstyle is supported by mana acceleration from cards like Noble Hierarch and Horizon Canopy, ensuring that the deck can quickly deploy its threats and continue applying pressure."
