The deck is heavily focused on disruption with spells like Thoughtseize and Fatal Push, as well as card draw and selection with Dig Through Time and Opt. Overall, the strategy revolves around setting up the Inverter combo and protecting it until victory."

Torbran, Thane of Red Fell enhances all damage dealt, while cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish opponents for playing non-creature spells. This deck aims to end the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
