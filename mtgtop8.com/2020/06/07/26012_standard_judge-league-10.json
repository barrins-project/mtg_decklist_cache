The companion Yorion, Sky Nomad provides additional value by flickering permanents for extra ETB effects. Overall, this deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents through efficient control and card advantage."

By using cards like Teferi, Time Raveler to control the board and protect your creatures, along with a mix of removal and card draw, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and tempo advantage. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the color requirements of the spells and creatures in the deck."
