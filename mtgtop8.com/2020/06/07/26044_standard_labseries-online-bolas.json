The key strategy is to ramp up mana with Wilderness Reclamation and Growth Spiral, while generating token creatures with Shark Typhoon. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by efficiently using its resources and ultimately win through overwhelming card advantage and powerful late-game threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Brazen Borrower. The goal is to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent until victory is secured."
