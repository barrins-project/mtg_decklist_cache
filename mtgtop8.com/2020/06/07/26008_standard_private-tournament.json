Using cards like Pelt Collector and Rimrock Knight to buff creatures and overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of Bonecrusher Giant and Embercleave provides additional removal and finishers. And with the addition of cards like Paradise Druid and Edgewall Innkeeper, the deck aims to maintain board presence while also drawing cards efficiently. The mana base includes lands like Stomping Ground and Castle Embereth to ensure consistent mana production."
