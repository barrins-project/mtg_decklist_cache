Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides additional card draw and life gain, while Brazen Borrower offers versatility as both a creature and a bounce spell. The deck also includes a variety of lands to ensure consistent mana production."

It utilizes cards like Uro, Brazen Borrower, Mystical Dispute, and Wilderness Reclamation to disrupt the opponent's game plan and establish board control. The deck also includes powerful card draw and mana ramp options like Growth Spiral and Shark Typhoon, allowing the player to outvalue their opponent in the late game. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements and provide flexibility in playing various spells."
