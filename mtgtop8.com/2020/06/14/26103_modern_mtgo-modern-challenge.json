By utilizing versatile cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Cryptic Command, and Wrenn and Six, you can disrupt your opponent's strategy while gaining incremental advantages. The deck also includes efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay to deal with threats quickly. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides card advantage and a powerful late-game threat. The mana base is built around snow lands and fetch lands to ensure consistent access to mana and enable powerful cards like Ice-Fang Coatl."
