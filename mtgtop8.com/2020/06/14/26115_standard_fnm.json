Utilizing Trail of Crumbs for card advantage and Bolas's Citadel for potential explosive plays, the deck aims to control the board and outvalue opponents through efficient synergies. Claim the Firstborn provides additional disruption while Korvold, Fae-Cursed King serves as a powerful finisher and card draw engine. The deck aims to grind opponents out of resources and overwhelm them with a steady stream of threats and value."
