By utilizing cards like Casualties of War, Shark Typhoon, and Aether Gust, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating incremental advantages through cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Hydroid Krasis. The deck also includes efficient ramp in the form of Growth Spiral and powerful planeswalkers like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Tamiyo, Collector of Tales to further solidify its control over the game."
