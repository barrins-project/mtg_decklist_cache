The inclusion of Umori as a companion provides additional consistency to the deck by restricting the types of cards that can be played, ensuring a streamlined and effective strategy. By efficiently utilizing the mutate mechanic and strong mana ramp options, this Simic Aggro deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a swift victory in one-on-one matches."
