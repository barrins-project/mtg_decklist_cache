It aims to control the game with counterspells like Negate and Mystical Dispute, alongside removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire and Aether Gust. The main win condition is Shark Typhoon, creating a large flying threat that can close out the game quickly. The deck also utilizes card draw and selection with Opt and Castle Vantress to ensure consistent answers and threats are available."
