The deck aims to survive the early game through cards like Wilt and Aether Gust, before dropping high-impact threats like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. The deck can also control the board with cards like Thought Erasure and Casualties of War, while also generating value with cards like Growth Spiral and Hydroid Krasis. The mana base is designed to support all the different colors required for the deck's spells."

By utilizing cards like Cauldron Familiar, Mayhem Devil, and Woe Strider, the deck aims to control the board and drain opponent's life total. The inclusion of Claim the Firstborn and Angrath's Rampage also adds disruption to the opponent's strategy. Additionally, the deck includes powerful top-end threats like Korvold, Fae-Cursed King to close out games."
