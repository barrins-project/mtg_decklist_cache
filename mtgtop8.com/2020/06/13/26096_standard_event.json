By utilizing cards like Trail of Crumbs, Priest of Forgotten Gods, and Woe Strider, the deck can generate value from sacrificing creatures and triggering abilities. The combination of Cauldron Familiar, Witch's Oven, and Mayhem Devil creates a strong synergy that can deal damage to the opponent while gaining resources. Bolas's Citadel provides a strong finisher for the deck, allowing for explosive turns and card advantage. The deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents through efficient resource management."
