By ramping with cards like Growth Spiral and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, the deck aims to hit its powerful late-game cards like Casualties of War and Shark Typhoon. Thought Erasure and Narset, Parter of Veils help disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Atris, Oracle of Half-Truths provides card advantage. The deck also has access to powerful planeswalkers like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Liliana, Dreadhorde General to help close out the game."
