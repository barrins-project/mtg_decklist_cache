The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage and protecting its own threats. By utilizing a combination of board wipes, removal spells, and card draw effects, the deck seeks to outlast its opponents and win through incremental advantage. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad allows for additional value by flickering permanents and gaining additional card advantage."
