By utilizing cards like Selfless Spirit and Supreme Phantom to pump up the team, as well as disruptive creatures like Spell Queller to control the board, the deck aims to reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can stabilize. Collected Company provides additional creature consistency and card advantage, while Brazen Borrower offers a versatile threat and potential tempo swing. The deck's mana base ensures smooth casting of spells and creatures throughout the game."
