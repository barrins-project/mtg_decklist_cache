The key strategy is to stall the game until you can establish a dominant position and close out the game efficiently."

By consistently applying pressure with creatures like Ajani's Pridemate and Imperious Oligarch, while controlling the board with cards like Dire Tactics and Mortify, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Ob Nixilis, the Hate-Twisted and Liliana, Dreadhorde General provides additional win conditions and card advantage to maintain dominance on the battlefield."

The key strategy is to create a board presence of small, powerful creatures that are difficult to remove while using protective spells to keep them alive and deal damage to the opponent quickly. The deck aims to win through a combination of fast creature plays and protection spells to push damage through."
