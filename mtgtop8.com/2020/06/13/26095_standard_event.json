The combination of Witch's Oven, Cauldron Familiar, and Mayhem Devil allows for consistent damage and removal options. Trail of Crumbs helps to dig for essential cards, while cards like Claim the Firstborn provide additional control options. Korvold, Fae-Cursed King serves as the primary win condition, growing in power with each sacrifice made. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outcontrol the opponent to secure victory."
