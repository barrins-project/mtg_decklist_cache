This is achieved through a combination of low-cost spells like Chain Lightning, Lightning Bolt, and Pyroblast, supported by efficient creatures like Delver of Secrets, Dreadhorde Arcanist, and True-Name Nemesis. The deck also includes counterspells like Daze and Force of Will to protect its threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck utilizes cantrips like Ponder, Preordain, and Brainstorm to ensure consistent card selection and maintain tempo. The mana base is streamlined with fetch lands and dual lands to support the deck's color requirements and to disrupt the opponent's mana base with cards like Wasteland."

The deck also aims to create a strong mana base with cards like Mox Diamond and Ancient Tomb while utilizing lands like Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage to quickly create a powerful 20/20 Marit Lage token. The deck also has access to utility lands like Bojuka Bog and Blast Zone to disrupt opponent's strategies."

The use of Chancellor of the Annex and other disruptive cards helps protect the combo by slowing down the opponent. The deck aims to quickly set up a powerful board state and overwhelm the opponent with creatures that they may struggle to deal with, ultimately leading to a victory through attacking or alternate win conditions like Tendrils of Agony."
