Torbran, Thane of Red Fell boosts the damage output of all red sources, while cards like Cavalcade of Calamity and Scorch Spitter capitalize on dealing damage when small creatures attack. Tibalt, Rakish Instigator and Chandra, Acolyte of Flame provide additional ways to deal damage, while Castle Embereth boosts the power of all creatures. The goal is to relentlessly attack and burn the opponent down before they have a chance to stabilize."
