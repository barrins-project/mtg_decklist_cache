The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and aggressive strategy, utilizing cards like All That Glitters and Stonecoil Serpent to boost the power of creatures. Season of Growth helps to draw more cards and maintain momentum, while Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by allowing cards to be recurred from the graveyard. The deck focuses on efficient creatures and enchantments to win the game quickly."
