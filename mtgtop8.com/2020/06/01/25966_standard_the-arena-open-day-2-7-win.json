The deck also includes a variety of control tools, such as Shark Typhoon and Elspeth Conquers Death, to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with card advantage and powerful threats."

Cards like Bonecrusher Giant and Brazen Borrower provide additional removal and disruption, while Kenrith, the Returned King offers a versatile late-game threat. With a mix of aggression and powerful synergies, this deck aims to close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
