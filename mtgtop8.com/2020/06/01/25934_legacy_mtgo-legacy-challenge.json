This deck also includes cards like Unmask and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect your combo pieces. The goal is to use cards that allow you to cheat creatures from the graveyard into play to assemble a powerful board state and close out the game with cards like Tendrils of Agony. The deck aims to win quickly and efficiently by utilizing graveyard interaction and powerful reanimation spells."

It also utilizes card advantage with cards like Baleful Strix and Ice-Fang Coatl to outvalue opponents. The deck's mana base is optimized with snow lands and mana fixing through cards like Arcum's Astrolabe and Abundant Growth. The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by flickering permanents for extra card advantage and board control."
