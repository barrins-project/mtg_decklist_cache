The key strategy revolves around utilizing cards like Witch's Oven, Cauldron Familiar, and Woe Strider to create a loop of sacrificing and dealing damage, while also using cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods and Mayhem Devil to further pressure the opponent. Additionally, including cards like Claim the Firstborn and Robber of the Rich allows for stealing the opponent's creatures and resources to gain an advantage."
