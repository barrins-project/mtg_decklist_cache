It utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi and Nissa to generate card advantage and control the board, while also having access to powerful threats like Hydroid Krasis and Uro to close out the game. The inclusion of Yorion as a companion allows for additional card advantage and flexibility in the late game. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and grind out incremental advantages to secure victory."
