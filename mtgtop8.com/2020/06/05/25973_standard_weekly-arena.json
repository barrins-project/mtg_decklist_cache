The deck aims to protect its creatures with spells like Gods Willing and Karametra's Blessing, while also gaining card advantage with Season of Growth. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for efficient recursion of low-cost permanents. Overall, the deck focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with aggressive plays and efficient combat tricks."
