With a mono-blue aggro strategy, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a continuous stream of cheap creatures while disrupting their game plan through milling. By utilizing the synergy between Persistent Petitioners and a high number of Islands, this deck aims to win the game by emptying the opponent's library before they can mount an effective defense."
