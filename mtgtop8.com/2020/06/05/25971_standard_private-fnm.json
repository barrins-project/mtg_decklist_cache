The deck aims to flood the board with creatures, eventually finishing off the opponent with the powerful End-Raze Forerunners. The inclusion of Umori, the Collector as a companion allows for additional synergies and a more consistent game plan. Overall, the deck focuses on aggressive plays and overwhelming the opponent with a mix of creatures and mana acceleration."
