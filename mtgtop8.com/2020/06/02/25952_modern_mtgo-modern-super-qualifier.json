The key strategy involves playing low-cost spells to trigger prowess on Monastery Swiftspear and grow Death's Shadow, while also disrupting the opponent's hand with discard spells like Thoughtseize. The deck uses Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion to provide additional value by recurring important cards from the graveyard. By combining aggressive creature attacks with disruptive spells, this deck aims to swiftly defeat the opponent before they can stabilize."
