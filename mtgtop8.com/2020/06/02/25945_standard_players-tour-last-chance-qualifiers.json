The key strategy is to use Fires of Invention as a way to cast multiple spells for free each turn, allowing the player to outvalue their opponent and establish a dominant board presence. Yorion, Sky Nomad serves as a powerful companion that can blink permanents for additional value. Overall, the deck aims to slow down the game and grind out a win through incremental advantage."

This sets up for a strong mid-game presence with Cauldron Familiar, Woe Strider, and Mayhem Devil. The deck aims to generate value through sacrificing creatures with Witch's Oven and triggering abilities like Trail of Crumbs. Bolas's Citadel is used as a win condition to close out the game. The mana base provides a consistent ramp and fixing for the deck's multicolor requirements."
