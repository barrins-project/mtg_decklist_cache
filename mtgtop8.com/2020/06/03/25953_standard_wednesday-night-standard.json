Domri's Ambush and The Ozolith help maintain control of the battlefield, while The Crystalline Giant provides versatility. The inclusion of Wildborn Preserver and Stonecoil Serpent adds flexibility and resilience to the deck. The mana base is optimized for consistent early game aggression, making this Gruul Aggro deck a formidable force in Standard 1 vs 1 matchups."
