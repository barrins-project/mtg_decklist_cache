The deck aims to control the board with counterspells like Sinister Sabotage and Quench, while also generating card advantage with cards like Spectral Sailor. The inclusion of Castle Vantress provides additional late-game power, while Ashiok's Erasure offers removal and disruption. Overall, the deck aims to be proactive and apply pressure while maintaining control of the game."
