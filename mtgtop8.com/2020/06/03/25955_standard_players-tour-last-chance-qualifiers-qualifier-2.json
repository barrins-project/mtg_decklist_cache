It aims to survive the early game by countering threats and removing creatures with board wipes like Shatter the Sky. The deck generates card advantage through cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Omen of the Sea, while also creating threats with Shark Typhoon and Brazen Borrower. Yorion, Sky Nomad serves as an additional win condition and allows for extra value by flickering permanents. The key strategy is to outvalue the opponent and ultimately win through card advantage and powerful threats."

By utilizing counterspells, removal spells, and sweepers like Shatter the Sky, the deck aims to control the board and out-value the opponent. The addition of Yorion as a companion allows for even more versatility and card advantage, making it difficult for the opponent to gain a foothold in the game. Overall, the deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents through careful resource management and powerful control elements."
