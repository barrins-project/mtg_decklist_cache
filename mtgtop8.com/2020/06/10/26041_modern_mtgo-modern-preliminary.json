This allows you to cast powerful threats like Glorybringer and Seasoned Pyromancer quickly. The deck also includes disruption elements like Pillage and Magus of the Moon to hinder your opponent's strategy. Additionally, there are cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Klothys, God of Destiny for added value and versatility. The overall game plan is to control the board while developing a strong mana base to outvalue and overwhelm the opponent."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game through counterspells, removal, and card advantage, while also leveraging the powerful synergy between snow permanents and Wrenn and Six. By using powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and versatile creatures like Ice-Fang Coatl, the deck can outvalue opponents and grind them out over the course of a longer game. The deck also has a strong mana base with fetch lands and cantrips to ensure consistency and flexibility in its answers."
