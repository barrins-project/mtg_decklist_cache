The goal is to quickly build a board presence and overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient threats. The mana base is designed to support the three colors of Mardu while providing consistency in casting spells. By combining efficient creatures and powerful equipment, the deck aims to close out games quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
