            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game by using counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to outvalue the opponent. It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage through various spells. The deck includes powerful planeswalkers like Narset and Ashiok, as well as finishers like Ugin and Liliana. The win condition is usually through incremental advantage gained by controlling the board and outpacing the opponent in card advantage. The deck also includes a mix of creatures like Nightveil Predator and Lochmere Serpent to pressure the opponent when needed."
