The deck aims to put constant pressure on your opponent by playing creatures with high power and toughness early in the game, supported by cards like Ram Through and Gemrazer to remove any obstacles in your way. With a focus on speed and efficiency, Mono Green Aggro looks to quickly establish board presence and close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
