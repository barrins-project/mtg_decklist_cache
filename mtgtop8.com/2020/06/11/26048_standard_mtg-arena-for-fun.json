By utilizing cards like Raise the Alarm and Forbidden Friendship, along with aggressive creatures like Legion Warboss and Squad Captain, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with high-powered attacks. Winota, Joiner of Forces acts as a key piece that can generate massive value by cheating out even more powerful creatures from the deck. With support from cards like Embercleave and Taranika, Akroan Veteran, this deck aims to close out games quickly with a strong aggro game plan."
