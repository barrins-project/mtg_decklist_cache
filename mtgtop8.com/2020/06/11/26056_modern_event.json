Card draw and mana fixing cards like Light Up the Stage, Manamorphose, and Fiery Islet help maintain momentum and ensure a consistent flow of spells to finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."

The deck also aims to ramp up its mana and fix its colors with cards like Growth Spiral and Abundant Growth, eventually overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Stoneforge Mystic fetching equipment like Sword of Feast and Famine and Batterskull. The deck's win condition is to outvalue the opponent and control the game until it can establish a dominating board presence."
