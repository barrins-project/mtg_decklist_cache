By utilizing cards like Light Up the Stage and Runaway Steam-Kin, the deck aims to maintain a fast pace while constantly applying pressure to the opponent. With powerful finishers like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell, the deck can quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. In essence, this deck aims to win the game through early and consistent aggression."
