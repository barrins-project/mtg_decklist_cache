It also includes an array of counterspells and removal spells to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides card advantage and life gain, while Brazen Borrower offers tempo plays. The mana base includes Triomes for color fixing, Fabled Passage for thinning the deck, and utility lands like Blast Zone and Castle Vantress. The goal is to outvalue the opponent and win through incremental advantages."
