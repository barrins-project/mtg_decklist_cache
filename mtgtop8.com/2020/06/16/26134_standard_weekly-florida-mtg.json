By utilizing Claim the Firstborn and Call of the Death-Dweller, the deck can disrupt the opponent's board while strengthening its own.

The deck utilizes cards like Voracious Hydra, Stonecoil Serpent, and Gemrazer to apply pressure early on, while also including cards like Vivien, Arkbow Ranger and Questing Beast for additional power and utility. The mana base is heavily focused on Forests with Castle Garenbrig and Mobilized District for additional support. Overall, the strategy revolves around playing efficient creatures and using them to quickly defeat the opponent before they can stabilize."
