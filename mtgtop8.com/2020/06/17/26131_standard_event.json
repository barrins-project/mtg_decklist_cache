The deck also includes impactful spells like Embercleave and Domri's Ambush to help maintain pressure on the opponent. Utilizing cards that can be played for cheap or have added flexibility such as Bonecrusher Giant and Phoenix of Ash, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of creatures with haste like Gallia of the Endless Dance adds even more speed to the deck's strategy."
