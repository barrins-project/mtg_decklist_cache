By continuously recycling key spells and creatures, the deck aims to outlast its opponent and ultimately win through card advantage and efficient control tactics. The mana base is designed to support the deck?s strategy of generating multiple colors of mana while also enabling early plays with Utopia Sprawl and Abundant Growth."
