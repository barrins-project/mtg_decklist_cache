By quickly building a board presence with cards like Pelt Collector and Yorvo, Lord of Garenbrig, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on. Utilizing cards like Ranger's Guile and Gemrazer to protect and enhance creatures, the deck seeks to maintain an aggressive stance throughout the game. The inclusion of Vivien planeswalkers provides additional utility and card advantage to further support the aggressive strategy."
