It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating value through cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Mystic Sanctuary. The deck also utilizes Wilderness Reclamation to generate mana advantage and finish the game with powerful spells like Expansion / Explosion. The inclusion of cards like Magus of the Moon and Aether Gust helps in dealing with specific threats, while also providing additional ways to control the game. Ultimately, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent to secure victory."
