            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game by countering opponent's spells, removing threats, and generating card advantage. It aims to ramp up mana quickly with Growth Spiral and Wilderness Reclamation to cast powerful spells like Expansion / Explosion and Shark Typhoon. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides additional card advantage and life gain. Teferi, Master of Time helps to manipulate the game's tempo. The deck's mana base allows for flexibility and consistency in casting spells of different colors. The key strategy is to outvalue the opponent and maintain control of the game until victory."
