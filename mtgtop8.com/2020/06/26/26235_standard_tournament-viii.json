Steel Overseer and Crystalline Giant provide additional threats on the board, while cards like Gingerbrute and Stonecoil Serpent offer versatility in combat. The deck also includes some utility lands like Blast Zone and Mobilized District for extra options. Overall, the focus is on playing aggressively and efficiently to overwhelm the opponent."
