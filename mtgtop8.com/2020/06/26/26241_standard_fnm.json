The key strategy is to efficiently use mana to play multiple creatures each turn, utilizing cards like Conclave Mentor and Venerated Loxodon to further enhance the team. The inclusion of cards like Chamber Sentry and Stonecoil Serpent provide flexibility and scalability in adapting to different board states, making it a versatile and aggressive deck in Standard 1 vs 1 format."
