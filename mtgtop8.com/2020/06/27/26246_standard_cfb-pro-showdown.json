This allows the deck to adapt to various situations, whether it's aggressively attacking with flying creatures like Brazen Borrower or playing a more defensive game with counter spells like Mystical Dispute and Rewind. The deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents while maintaining a solid defensive strategy."

Nightpack Ambusher provides a threat on the board, while Brazen Borrower offers versatility. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent and maintain control of the game until it can win with its powerful spells."
