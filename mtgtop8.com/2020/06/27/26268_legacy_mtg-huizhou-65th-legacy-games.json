By utilizing cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Sanctum Prelate to slow down the opponent, along with Wasteland and Rishadan Port to disrupt their mana base, the deck aims to control the game tempo. Stoneforge Mystic and equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte provide additional threats and utility to close out the game quickly. The deck also includes cards like Flickerwisp and Mother of Runes for additional flexibility and protection."
