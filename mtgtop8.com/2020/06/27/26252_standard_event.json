Teferi, Time Raveler helps to disrupt opponents' strategies, while Nightpack Ambusher and Brazen Borrower provide aggressive threats. The deck also includes Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath for additional ramp and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of disruption, aggression, and card advantage."
