By utilizing cards like The Great Henge, Nissa, Who Shakes the World, and Vivien, Arkbow Ranger to generate value and provide support, this Mono Green Aggro deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out games efficiently. With a strong curve of creatures and the ability to ramp up mana with cards like Gilded Goose and Wolfwillow Haven, this deck is designed to be fast and aggressive."
