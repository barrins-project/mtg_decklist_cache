It also aims to ramp up mana quickly with cards like Growth Spiral and Nissa, allowing for big threats like Hydroid Krasis and Uro to hit the board early. The deck can also generate card advantage through effects like Teferi, Master of Time's ability and Shark Typhoon's cycling, while maintaining board presence with cards like Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse. Overall, the strategy is to outvalue and outlast the opponent through strong control elements and efficient threats."
