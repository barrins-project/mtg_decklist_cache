Additionally, protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense help to protect the creatures from removal spells or combat damage. The deck aims to win the game through poison counters rather than traditional damage."

By efficiently tutoring for key pieces with cards like Summoner's Pact and Tolaria West, the deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces to overwhelm the opponent with powerful land-based threats and combos. The synergy between bounce lands, extra land drops, and untap effects allows for a high degree of consistency and explosiveness in executing its game plan."
