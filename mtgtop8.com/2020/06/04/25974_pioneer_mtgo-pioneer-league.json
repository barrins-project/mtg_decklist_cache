The deck utilizes a mix of powerful planeswalkers, enchantments, and versatile creatures to control the game's tempo and eventually win through incremental advantage and strategic plays. With a mix of removal, disruption, and win conditions, the deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a slow, grindy match-up."

The deck aims to quickly assemble and protect the Inverter of Truth and Oracle combo, while disrupting opponents with counterspells like Censor and removal spells like Fatal Push. It also utilizes card advantage with Dig Through Time and disruption with Thoughtseize to control the game until it can execute its win condition."
