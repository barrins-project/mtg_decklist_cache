By consistently putting pressure on the opponent and gaining value from Winota's ability, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and close out the game quickly. The inclusion of cards like Raise the Alarm and General's Enforcer helps to generate tokens and protect key creatures, while powerful additions like General Kudro of Drannith and Tajic, Legion's Edge provide additional support and disruption to ensure victory."
