It includes a mix of low-cost creatures like Lazotep Reaver and Grim Initiate to trigger Winota's ability, as well as powerful creatures like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Tajic, Legion's Edge to capitalize on the extra attacks. Fight as One and Embercleave provide additional combat tricks and buffs to help push damage through and overwhelm the opponent. The mana base is built to support the deck's three-color requirements."
