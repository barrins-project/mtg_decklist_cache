It aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly with a combination of evasive creatures like Gingerbrute and lifelink from cards like Healer's Hawk. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for recursion of small creatures and enchantments, maintaining pressure on the opponent. The deck also benefits from card draw and added power through Season of Growth and All That Glitters."
