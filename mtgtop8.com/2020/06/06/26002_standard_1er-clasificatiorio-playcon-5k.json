The deck also utilizes lands like Castle Vantress and Blast Zone to further control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outplay the opponent through efficient use of resources and powerful spells."

By utilizing cards like Witch's Oven and Woe Strider to constantly feed the engine, the deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent. Bolas's Citadel provides a powerful late-game option, while Claim the Firstborn offers disruption and potential swing turns. Korvold, Fae-Cursed King serves as a powerful finisher and card draw engine. The deck's mana base is built to support its consistent and synergistic gameplay."

The key concept revolves around ramping up mana with Wilderness Reclamation, playing powerful spells, and outvaluing the opponent. Cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Brazen Borrower provide additional value and tempo plays, while counterspells like Mystical Dispute and Negate help protect your board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Thassa's Intervention and Scorching Dragonfire offer additional versatility and removal options."
