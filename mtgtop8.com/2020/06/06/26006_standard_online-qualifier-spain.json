The deck focuses on generating value by sacrificing creatures with cards like Woe Strider and Priest of Forgotten Gods, triggering effects such as Mayhem Devil and Trail of Crumbs. It also aims to control the opponent's board state with Claim the Firstborn and removal spells. The deck uses its mana base efficiently to maintain a strong presence on the battlefield and consistently draw cards with Castle Locthwain and Fabled Passage."

The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion provides additional value by allowing for the repeated casting of cheap creatures from the graveyard. The \"Cycling Aggro\" archetype focuses on efficiently cycling through cards while also applying consistent pressure to the opponent."

The deck also includes removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire and Flame Sweep to deal with threats. The mana base is designed to support the three colors of the Temur colors: blue, red, and green, ensuring that the player has access to the spells they need."
