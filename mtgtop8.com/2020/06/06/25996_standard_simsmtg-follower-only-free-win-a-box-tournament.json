By using cards like Claim the Firstborn and Woe Strider, the deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy and gaining incremental advantages over time. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Bolas's Citadel and Korvold, Fae-Cursed King to close out games. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents through a combination of sacrifice synergies and disruptive elements."
