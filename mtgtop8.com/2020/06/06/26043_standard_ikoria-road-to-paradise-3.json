The deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Nissa, Who Shakes the World to control the board and generate value. Cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Tamiyo, Collector of Tales help to dig through the deck and find key pieces. As the game progresses, the deck aims to stabilize with board wipes like Shatter the Sky and Elspeth Conquers Death, while closing out the game with cards like Hydroid Krasis and Shark Typhoon."
