The deck also includes fast mana acceleration with cards like Lotus Petal and Dark Ritual to help set up the combo quickly. There are also disruptive elements like Unmask and Thoughtseize to protect the combo. The deck aims to win the game by generating a large storm count with Tendrils of Agony or by attacking with the reanimated creatures."
