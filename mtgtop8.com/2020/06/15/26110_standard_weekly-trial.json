The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while slowly building up resources and eventually overwhelming them with powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Hydroid Krasis. Yorion, Sky Nomad provides additional value by flickering permanents for extra ETB effects. The deck aims to outlast and outvalue the opponent in a war of attrition, ultimately coming out on top through superior card advantage and board control."
