Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Nightpack Ambusher provide additional threats and value in the mid-to-late game. The deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents by controlling the board and countering key spells, while gradually building up its own resources to overwhelm the opponent in the late game."
