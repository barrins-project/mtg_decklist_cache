The deck also utilizes cards like Brazen Borrower and Shark Typhoon for tempo plays and closing out the game with Expansion / Explosion. The mana base is built to support the three different colors required for the deck's spells. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with powerful spells and creatures."

This allows for triggers like Mayhem Devil and Trail of Crumbs to apply pressure on the opponent's life total and card advantage. The combination of Gilded Goose and Woe Strider provides additional sacrifice outlets, while Cauldron Familiar and Witch's Oven create a recurring loop. The deck also includes Claim the Firstborn for stealing threats and disruption options."

By using Yorion, Sky Nomad as the companion, the deck can consistently flicker permanents for additional value and card advantage, ultimately out-valuing the opponent and controlling the game until it can win."
