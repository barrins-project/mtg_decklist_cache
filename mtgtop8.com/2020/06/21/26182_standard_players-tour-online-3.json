Elspeth Conquers Death provides removal and recursion, while Shark Typhoon can create threats to close out the game. The deck's strength lies in its ability to out-value opponents and maintain control of the game until it can win with powerful finishers like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Hydroid Krasis."
