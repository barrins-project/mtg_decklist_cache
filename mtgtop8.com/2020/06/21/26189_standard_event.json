The deck aims to utilize the synergy between cheap creatures and burn spells like Heartfire, while also providing card advantage with Chandra, Acolyte of Flame and Light Up the Stage. The inclusion of creatures with haste and the ability to pump damage output with Castle Embereth further emphasize the deck's aggressive nature."
