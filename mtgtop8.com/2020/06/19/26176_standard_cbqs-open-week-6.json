It focuses on ramping up mana with cards like Growth Spiral and Wilderness Reclamation, while also utilizing powerful control tools such as Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Shark Typhoon. The deck aims to stall the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with card draw and powerful spells like Expansion / Explosion. With a mix of counterspells, removal, and card advantage, this deck aims to out-value and outlast its opponents in a grindy matchup."
