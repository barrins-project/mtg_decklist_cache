By using cards like Trinisphere, Chalice of the Void, and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to slow down the opponent's game plan, while also establishing a strong board presence with creatures like Legion Warboss, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Winota, Joiner of Forces. This deck aims to pressure the opponent early and efficiently, using mana acceleration from cards like Chrome Mox and Simian Spirit Guide to get ahead in the game."
