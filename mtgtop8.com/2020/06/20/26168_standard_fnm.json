By playing powerful creatures like Rotting Regisaur and Spawn of Mayhem, combined with strong removal spells like Bonecrusher Giant and Embercleave, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently to take down the opponent before they can stabilize. The deck also utilizes cards like Stormfist Crusader and Knight of the Ebon Legion to maintain card advantage and pressure the opponent. The overall goal is to maintain aggressive pressure throughout the game and secure a fast victory."
