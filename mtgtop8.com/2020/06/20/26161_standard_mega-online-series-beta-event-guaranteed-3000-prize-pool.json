It aims to ramp up mana quickly with cards like Growth Spiral and Wilderness Reclamation while utilizing powerful control cards like Mystical Dispute and Frilled Mystic to disrupt opponent's game plan. The deck also includes cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath for card advantage and Shark Typhoon for creating threats. Overall, the deck focuses on resource management and out-valuing opponents to secure victory."
