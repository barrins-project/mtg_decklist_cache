It aims to overwhelm opponents quickly with aggressive plays, utilizing Fae of Wishes to toolbox for answers as needed. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to all colors needed for the deck's spells and creatures. The deck excels at maintaining pressure on opponents and out-valuing them with its powerful synergies."
