By using cards like Magus of the Moon and Pillage to disrupt the opponent's resources, while also ramping up with Utopia Sprawl, Arbor Elf, and Seasoned Pyromancer, the deck aims to create a powerful board state and overwhelm the opponent with threats like Glorybringer and Klothys. Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides additional value and removal options, while Lightning Bolt offers versatile removal and reach to close out games."
