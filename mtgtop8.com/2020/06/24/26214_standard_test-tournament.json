It aims to ramp up quickly with cards like Growth Spiral and Nissa, Who Shakes the World, while also generating value and card advantage with Chemister's Insight and Shark Typhoon. The inclusion of Fabled Passage and Castle Vantress helps with fixing mana and providing additional utility. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of aggression and control."
