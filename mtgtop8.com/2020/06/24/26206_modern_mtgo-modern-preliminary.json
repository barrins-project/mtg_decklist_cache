The deck's win condition is to attack with a massive Death's Shadow or Gurmag Angler, supported by cheap removal spells and combat tricks like Temur Battle Rage. The inclusion of cards like Snapcaster Mage and Cling to Dust provide additional value and card advantage, while The Royal Scions can provide both card filtering and a way to close out the game quickly."
