            "notes": "The main focus of this Dimir Inverter deck is to quickly mill the library and then win the game by using either Jace, Wielder of Mysteries or Thassa's Oracle. The deck relies on a combination of card draw, removal spells, and disruption to control the game until it can set up its win condition. By utilizing cards like Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Dig Through Time, the deck can efficiently dig through its library and set up the combo to win the game. With a strong control element and powerful win conditions, this deck aims to outmaneuver and outlast its opponents."
