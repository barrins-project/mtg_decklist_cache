The goal is to maintain a fast pace and pressure the opponent with hasty creatures like Fervent Champion and Robber of the Rich, while also utilizing strong finishers like Embercleave and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell to close out the game quickly. The deck aims to control the board and deal as much damage as possible before the opponent can stabilize."
