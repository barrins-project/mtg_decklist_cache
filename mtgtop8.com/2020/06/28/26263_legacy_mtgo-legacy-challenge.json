It utilizes cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns, Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and Cavern Harpy to create a strong board presence and gain incremental advantages over the opponent. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Abrupt Decay to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the key strategy is to efficiently use Aluren to generate value and overwhelm the opponent with a powerful board state."
