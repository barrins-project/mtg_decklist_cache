The deck also has disruptive elements such as Tidehollow Sculler to disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a mix of creatures that can come back from the graveyard like Gravecrawler and Relentless Dead, it aims to maintain a constant presence on the battlefield."

The main goal is to eventually play a Primeval Titan, which can search for specific lands such as Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Field of the Dead to deal massive damage or create an army of zombies. The deck also includes some interaction and protection with cards like Pact of Negation and Engineered Explosives."
