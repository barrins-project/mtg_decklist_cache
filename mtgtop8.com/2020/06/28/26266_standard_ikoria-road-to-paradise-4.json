By utilizing Winota's ability to cheat out powerful creatures, such as Tajic, Legion's Edge and Igneous Cur, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with multiple attackers and finish them off with cards like Embercleave. Selfless Savior provides protection for key creatures, while Alpine Houndmaster and Seasoned Hallowblade offer additional value and resilience. The mana base is designed to support the primarily white and red mana requirements of the deck."
