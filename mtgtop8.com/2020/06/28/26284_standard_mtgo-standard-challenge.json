The key strategy involves using powerful planeswalkers like Teferi and Nissa, along with card advantage engines like Uro and Shark Typhoon, to control the board and outlast the opponent. The deck also includes tools to stabilize the board, such as Shatter the Sky and Scavenging Ooze. By slowing down the opponent's game plan and putting pressure on them with threats like Hydroid Krasis and Jolrael, the deck aims to grind out advantages and secure victory."
