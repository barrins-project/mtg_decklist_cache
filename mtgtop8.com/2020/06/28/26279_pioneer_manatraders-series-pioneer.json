The win condition is to either mill out the opponent with Thassa's Oracle or Jace, Wielder of Mysteries, or to stabilize the board with Inverter of Truth and secure victory. This deck excels at outlasting opponents and disrupting their strategies."

It aims to outlast opponents by consistently answering threats and generating card advantage with cards like Teferi, Dig Through Time, and Omen of the Sea. The mana base is built around Azorius dual lands and utility lands like Field of Ruin, providing both consistency and flexibility. Overall, the deck prioritizes stability and resource management to outmaneuver opponents and emerge victorious in longer games."
