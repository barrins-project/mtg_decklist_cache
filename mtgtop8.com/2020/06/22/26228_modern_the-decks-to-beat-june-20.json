Karn, the Great Creator provides additional utility with access to sideboard options through artifacts. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Chalice of the Void and Walking Ballista, while also having a game-ending threat in Emrakul, the Promised End. The inclusion of All Is Dust and Warping Wail provides additional board control options to maintain pressure on the opponent."
