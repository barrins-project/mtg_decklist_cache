The deck includes powerful cards such as Bonecrusher Giant, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Eidolon of the Great Revel to apply pressure early in the game. Other key cards such as Monastery Swiftspear, Soul-Scar Mage, and Lightning Strike help maintain tempo and deal direct damage to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Rampaging Ferocidon further increase the deck's damage output, making it a formidable force in the Pioneer format."
