It aims to ramp up its mana with cards like Growth Spiral and Wilderness Reclamation, while countering threats with Aether Gust and Mystical Dispute. The deck also utilizes powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Nightpack Ambusher to pressure the opponent. The win condition often revolves around casting a large Expansion / Explosion or creating a massive Shark Typhoon token. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its superior late-game power."
