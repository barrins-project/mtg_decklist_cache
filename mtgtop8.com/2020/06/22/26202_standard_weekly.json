The goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total while maintaining a strong battlefield presence. Key cards such as Fervent Champion, Anax, Hardened in the Forge, and Torbran, Thane of Red Fell help to maximize damage output, while cards like Light Up the Stage provide card advantage to keep the pressure on the opponent."
