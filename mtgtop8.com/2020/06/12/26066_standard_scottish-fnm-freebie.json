By ramping up mana with Wilderness Reclamation and Growth Spiral, the deck aims to cast powerful spells like Expansion / Explosion and Shark Typhoon to outvalue and outlast the opponent. Utilizing cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Scorching Dragonfire helps to maintain board control while cards like Aether Gust, Mystical Dispute, and Thassa's Intervention provide additional disruption. The deck's versatility and ability to adapt to different situations make it a strong control archetype in Standard 1 vs 1."
