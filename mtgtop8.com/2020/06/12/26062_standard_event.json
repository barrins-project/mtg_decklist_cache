By playing efficient low-cost creatures like Pelt Collector and Lovestruck Beast, along with powerful finishers like Questing Beast and Gemrazer, the deck aims to apply consistent pressure and close out games swiftly. With access to pump spells like Giant Growth and Titanic Growth, the deck can surprise opponents with burst damage and make favorable trades in combat. Castle Garenbrig provides additional mana acceleration to help ramp into threats earlier in the game."
