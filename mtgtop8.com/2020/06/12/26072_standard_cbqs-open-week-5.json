The deck utilizes Shark Typhoon and Expansion/Explosion as win conditions to generate card advantage and close out the game. The inclusion of Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides additional card advantage and life gain. The lands in the deck allow for consistent mana fixing and the ability to play powerful spells like Scorching Dragonfire and Tale's End to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
