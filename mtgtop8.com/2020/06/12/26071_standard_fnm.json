The goal is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive attacks while using cards like Lurrus of the Dream-Den to continuously bring back valuable creatures from the graveyard. The inclusion of a versatile mix of creatures and enchantments allows for flexibility in combat decisions and ensures consistent pressure on the opponent."
