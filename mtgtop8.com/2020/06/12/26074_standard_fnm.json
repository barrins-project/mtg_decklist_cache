The deck focuses on aggressive plays and leveraging the synergy of cards that buff each other, such as Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Fervent Champion. With a focus on dealing damage directly to the opponent, this deck aims to close out games quickly and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
