The main strategy involves sacrificing creatures like Cauldron Familiar and Gutterbones to trigger effects like Mayhem Devil and Priest of Forgotten Gods. This allows for consistent damage output and card advantage through effects like Midnight Reaper. Claim the Firstborn and Village Rites provide additional utility and card draw, while Jegantha, the Wellspring serves as a powerful companion option. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of speed and resource advantage."
