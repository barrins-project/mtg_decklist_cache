By utilizing cards like Knight of the Ebon Legion and Spawn of Mayhem, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and maintain control of the board with cards such as Murderous Rider and Heartless Act. The inclusion of disruptive spells like Duress and Kitesail Freebooter helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan while cards like Rankle, Master of Pranks provide additional utility and ways to close out the game. Overall, the deck focuses on fast, efficient aggression to secure victory."
