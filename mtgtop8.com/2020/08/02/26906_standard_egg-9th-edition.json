The deck also relies on generating food tokens and triggers Trail of Crumbs to maintain card advantage. Korvold, Fae-Cursed King and Bolas's Citadel provide additional win conditions and card advantage for the control strategy. Ultimately, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through careful resource management."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly summoning multiple creatures to the battlefield and taking advantage of Winota's ability to cheat high impact creatures into play. By overwhelming the opponent with creatures and triggering Winota's ability multiple times, the deck aims to quickly close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. With a mix of low-cost creatures, token generators, and powerful finishers, this deck is designed to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react defensively."
