The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Agonizing Remorse and Thought Erasure, while also developing your own board presence with Nissa and the powerful creatures in the deck. Casualties of War provides a versatile removal spell that can swing the game in your favor, while Teferi, Master of Time offers card advantage and disruption. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the three-color combination."
