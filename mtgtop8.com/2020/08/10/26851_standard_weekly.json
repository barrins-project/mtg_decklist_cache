The deck includes various ways to protect these creatures, such as Selfless Savior and Barrin, Tolarian Archmage, while also including powerful threats like Bonecrusher Giant and Haktos the Unscarred. By maintaining pressure on the opponent and leveraging Winota's ability, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a victory through aggressive creature-based strategies."
