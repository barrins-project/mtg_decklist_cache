The deck runs a variety of triomes and other dual lands to ensure all colors can be easily accessed. The inclusion of Teferi, Time Raveler and Nahiri, the Harbinger provide additional control elements while cards like Thought Erasure and Bring to Light help dig for key pieces. Overall, the key strategy is to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with versatile threats and answers."

By utilizing cards like Wilderness Reclamation, Expansion/Explosion, and Dig Through Time, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent. Shark Typhoon provides a win condition while also generating card advantage. The deck also includes strong early game plays like Growth Spiral and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to ramp into its powerful late-game spells. Overall, the deck focuses on maintaining board control and slowly pulling ahead in card advantage to secure the win."
