By consistently playing efficient threats like Robber of the Rich, Questing Beast, and Bonecrusher Giant, along with the devastating Embercleave, you aim to end the game as quickly as possible. The Gruul Spellbreaker and other hasty creatures help maintain pressure on your opponent, while cards like Castle Embereth and Zhur-Taa Goblin provide additional reach to close out games. This deck aims to establish board presence early and keep up the pressure throughout the game."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy, ramp up mana with cards like Cultivate and Llanowar Visionary, and eventually overwhelm them with powerful threats like Uro and Hydroid Krasis. The deck also includes board wipes like Extinction Event and targeted removal like Eliminate and Heartless Act to deal with a variety of threats. Overall, the deck's strategy revolves around controlling the game and outvaluing the opponent over time."
