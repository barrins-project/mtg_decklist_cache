By utilizing cards like Lucky Clover and Edgewall Innkeeper, the deck can repeatedly trigger powerful adventure effects. The deck also includes a small ramp package with Beanstalk Giant and Escape to the Wilds, allowing for explosive turns and mana acceleration. Nissa, Who Shakes the World serves as a powerful late-game threat, providing additional resources and boosting the deck's mana production. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly while maintaining card advantage."
