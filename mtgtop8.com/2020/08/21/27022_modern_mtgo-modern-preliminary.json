The key strategy is to continuously dredge cards from the graveyard to fuel powerful combos and overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats. The deck aims to quickly assemble its pieces and outvalue the opponent through graveyard manipulation and explosive plays."

Blood Moon is used to further disrupt the opponent's mana base, while cards like Seasoned Pyromancer and Chandra, Torch of Defiance provide card advantage and additional threats. The deck aims to create a resource advantage through efficient removal and resilient threats, leading to a dominant board presence and eventual victory."
