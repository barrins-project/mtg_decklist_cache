It utilizes a mix of low-cost creatures and powerful auras to overwhelm opponents early in the game. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional recurring threats and auras, providing additional staying power in longer games. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Hushbringer to disrupt opponent strategies. Overall, the key concept revolves around creating a strong, efficient aggro deck focused on auras."
