The deck focuses on using cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Thought Erasure to control the opponent's hand and prevent them from drawing extra cards. Nissa, Who Shakes the World provides mana acceleration, allowing the deck to play its high-cost spells earlier. Shark Typhoon serves as a versatile threat and a way to create card advantage. Overall, the deck is designed to outvalue the opponent and control the game until it can overwhelm them with its powerful threats."
