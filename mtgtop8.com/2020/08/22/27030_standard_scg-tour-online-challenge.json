By doubling up on adventure spells with Lucky Clover, the deck can generate significant value and tempo advantage. The key strategy is to ramp into big threats like Beanstalk Giant and Lovestruck Beast while controlling the board with versatile creatures like Brazen Borrower and Bonecrusher Giant. Fae of Wishes provides additional flexibility by allowing the player to search for answers or threats from their sideboard. Escape to the Wilds offers card advantage and ensures the deck continues to apply pressure throughout the game."

The deck aims to outvalue opponents by generating card advantage with Narset and Tamiyo's abilities, while also ramping into big threats like Uro and Hydroid Krasis. The inclusion of Shark Typhoon provides additional value and threat generation, while cards like Casualties of War allow for massive swings in board state. The mana base is designed to support a flexible and powerful combination of spells."
