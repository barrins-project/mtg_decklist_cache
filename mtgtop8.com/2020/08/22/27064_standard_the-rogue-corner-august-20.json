The key strategy involves using cards like Claim the Firstborn and Priest of Forgotten Gods to control the opponent's creatures and resources, while setting up combos with cards like Lazav, the Multifarious and Archfiend's Vessel. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value by recurring smaller creatures from the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early in the game and maintain pressure until victory."
