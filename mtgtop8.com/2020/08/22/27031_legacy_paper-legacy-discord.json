It includes several mana acceleration cards to cast Doomsday as early as possible, along with cantrips to dig for combo pieces. Burning Wish provides additional versatility and access to sideboard cards. The win condition is typically using Doomsday to set up a winning pile with Thassa's Oracle as the finisher. Overall, the deck is focused on efficiently and effectively executing its combo game plan to secure a victory."
