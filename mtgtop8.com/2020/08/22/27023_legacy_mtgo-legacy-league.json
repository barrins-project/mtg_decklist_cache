The deck also includes ways to control the opponent's graveyard with Leyline of the Void and disruption with cards like Duress and Hymn to Tourach. The deck can also perform a secondary win condition with the combo of Grindstone and Helm of Obedience or generate a large storm count with cards like Lion's Eye Diamond and Infernal Tutor to win with Tendrils of Agony."
