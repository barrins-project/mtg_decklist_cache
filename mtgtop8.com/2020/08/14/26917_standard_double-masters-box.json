It includes cards that provide card advantage, temporary removal, and the ability to cast spells from the graveyard. The creatures in the deck have flying and can become powerful threats with the right spells. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and maintain that pressure through the use of efficient spells and creatures."
