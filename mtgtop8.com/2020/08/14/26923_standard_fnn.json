The deck utilizes powerful creatures like Nightpack Ambusher and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to apply pressure, supported by counter spells such as Lofty Denial and Essence Scatter to protect our creatures. The inclusion of Shark Typhoon provides additional threats and card advantage, while cards like Brineborn Cutthroat and Frilled Mystic offer versatility in dealing with various threats. The mana base is designed to support the multiple color requirements of the deck."
