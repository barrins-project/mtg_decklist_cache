By playing powerful creatures like Questing Beast and Lovestruck Beast early on, along with efficient removal options like Primal Might and Scavenging Ooze, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Pelt Collector and Ranger's Guile helps to further enhance the deck's aggression and resilience. Overall, this deck aims to go on the offensive from the start and maintain pressure throughout the game."
