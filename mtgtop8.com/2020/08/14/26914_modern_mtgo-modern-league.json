By including Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion, all odd-costed cards gain an additional damage boost, further increasing the deck's aggression. By focusing on cards like Lightning Bolt, Monastery Swiftspear, and Bonecrusher Giant, the deck aims to control the board and burn the opponent down before they can establish a defense. The inclusion of creatures like Bomat Courier and Blistercoil Weird provide additional damage and card advantage."
