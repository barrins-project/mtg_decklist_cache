The deck focuses on deploying threats quickly, boosting them with cards like Rancor and Elephant Guide, and utilizing mana acceleration with Burning-Tree Emissary and Nettle Sentinel. By applying constant pressure and utilizing evasion from creatures like Silhana Ledgewalker and Vault Skirge, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total before they can establish a strong defense."
