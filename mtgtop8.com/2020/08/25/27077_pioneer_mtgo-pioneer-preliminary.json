The key strategy is to apply pressure early using cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Rabblemaster, while finishing off your opponent with direct damage spells like Lightning Strike and Wild Slash. Torbran, Thane of Red Fell boosts your burn spells' effectiveness, and Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides additional card advantage and direct damage. The deck aims to win before the opponent can stabilize or gain too much life."
