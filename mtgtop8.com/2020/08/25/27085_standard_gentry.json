By utilizing cards like Bastion of Remembrance, Whisper Squad, and Mayhem Devil, the deck aims to create a board presence that can quickly overwhelm the opponent while also dealing damage through various triggers. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Tibalt, Rakish Instigator and Chandra, Awakened Inferno provides additional value and threat potential, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize and turn the game in their favor."
