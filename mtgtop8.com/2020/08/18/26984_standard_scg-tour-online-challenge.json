By ramping quickly with cards like Arboreal Grazer and Leafkin Druid, it aims to cast devastating spells like Genesis Ultimatum and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to quickly turn the tide of the game. The creatures in this deck provide additional value with their enter-the-battlefield triggers, allowing for a consistent stream of threats to pressure the opponent. Overall, this deck aims to be proactive and aggressive in its game plan to close out games quickly."
