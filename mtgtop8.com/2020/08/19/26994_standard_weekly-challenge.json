It also utilizes disruption and removal spells such as Thought Erasure and Casualties of War to control the board and outvalue opponents. The deck includes planeswalkers like Narset, Parter of Veils and Tamiyo, Collector of Tales to provide card advantage and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon as a win condition. The goal is to steadily build advantage and grind out wins through card advantage and efficient removal."
