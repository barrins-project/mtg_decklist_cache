The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game, utilizing cards like Scorch Spitter and Runaway Steam-Kin to generate mana and deal damage quickly. With cards like Light Up the Stage and Castle Embereth providing additional card advantage and damage, the deck aims to close out the game as quickly as possible."
