By disrupting the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Quench and Sinister Sabotage, and removal spells like Bonecrusher Giant and Flame Sweep, this deck aims to protect its threats and maintain tempo advantage. Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Shark Typhoon provide powerful late-game threats, while cards like Brazen Borrower and Frilled Mystic offer versatility in dealing with a variety of situations."
