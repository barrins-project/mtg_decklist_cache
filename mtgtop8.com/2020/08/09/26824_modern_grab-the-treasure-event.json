With Wilderness Reclamation and Nexus of Fate, the deck aims to generate extra mana and take extra turns to outvalue opponents. Wrenn and Six help with card advantage and recursion, while Uro provides a powerful threat and lifegain. The manabase supports the deck's three-color identity, with various dual lands and triomes. The inclusion of Field of the Dead offers a win condition through creating zombie tokens, making it difficult for opponents to keep up with the deck's control elements and overwhelming board presence."

The inclusion of cards like Dismember and All Is Dust help to deal with threats and clear the way for the Eldrazi creatures to dominate the battlefield."
