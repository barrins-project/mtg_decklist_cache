The goal is to quickly build up a board presence with cards like Faerie Vandal, Sprite Dragon, and Crackling Drake while efficiently removing any threats with spells like Shock and Soul Sear. The deck also includes counterspells like Miscast and Lofty Denial to protect its creatures and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base is designed to support the fast-paced nature of the deck."
