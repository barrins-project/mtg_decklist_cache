The deck aims to control the game by limiting the opponent's options with counterspells like Aether Gust and removal spells like Heartless Act and Eliminate. Additionally, the deck includes versatile planeswalkers like Narset, Parter of Veils and Tamiyo, Collector of Tales to further control the game and provide card advantage."
