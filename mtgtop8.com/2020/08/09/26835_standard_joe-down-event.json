By playing low-cost creatures like Scorch Spitter and Fervent Champion, as well as utilizing cards like Shock and Light Up the Stage for direct damage, the goal is to put pressure on the opponent early and often. The inclusion of cards like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Embercleave provides additional ways to push damage through and secure a quick victory. The deck aims to be a fast and efficient aggro deck that can close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
