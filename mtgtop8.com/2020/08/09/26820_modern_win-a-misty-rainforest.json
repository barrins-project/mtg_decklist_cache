Supporting these threats are a suite of burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Boros Charm to deal direct damage to the opponent and finish the game quickly. The deck also includes cards like Searing Blaze and Skullcrack to deal with opposing creatures and life gain strategies. Overall, this deck excels at applying constant pressure and closing out games before the opponent can stabilize."
