It also includes cards that prevent the opponent from gaining life or redirect damage back at them. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value by recurring low-cost permanents from the graveyard. The deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize or gain control, making it a challenging and relentless opponent in 1 vs 1 Modern matches."

It utilizes Wilderness Reclamation and Growth Spiral to ramp up mana quickly, while also taking advantage of Wrenn and Six for card advantage and recursion. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides a powerful threat and life gain, while Nexus of Fate allows for extra turns to pull further ahead. The deck also includes a land package with Field of the Dead for additional win conditions. Overall, the key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan and grind out a victory through control."
