By controlling the board with counterspells like Spell Queller and removal like Path to Exile, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient creatures and disruptive spells. Aether Vial allows for quick deployment of creatures, while cards like Force of Virtue and Supreme Phantom help boost the power of the flyers. Overall, the deck aims to quickly establish a dominant board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
