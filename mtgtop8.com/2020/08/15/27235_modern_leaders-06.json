The deck utilizes a combination of disruptive spells like Mana Leak, Force of Negation, and Disrupting Shoal to stop the opponent's threats, while also having efficient removal like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay. The creatures in the deck, such as Brazen Borrower, Ingenious Infiltrator, and Ninja of the Deep Hours, can sneak in damage while providing card advantage. The deck aims to control the game early on and close out the game quickly with evasive creatures."

It aims to out-value the opponent by generating card advantage with Fact or Fiction and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, while also maintaining board presence with Field of the Dead. It utilizes powerful cards like Cryptic Command and Wrenn and Six to control the tempo of the game, while also having a win condition with Shark Typhoon or Nexus of Fate. The deck is designed to be versatile and adaptable to different matchups."
