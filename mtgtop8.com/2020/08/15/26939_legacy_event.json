The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, answer threats efficiently, and eventually win the game through powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels."

The key strategy is to assemble the combo quickly and protect it from disruption to win the game efficiently."

Green Sun's Zenith and Natural Order help search for key creatures like Progenitus or Archon of Valor's Reach to quickly close out the game. The deck also utilizes powerful card draw in Sylvan Library and strong land-based ramp with Gaea's Cradle to ensure consistent high-impact plays."
