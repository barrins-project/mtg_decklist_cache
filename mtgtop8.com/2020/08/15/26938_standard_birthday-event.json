By ramping with Beanstalk Giant and Cultivate, the deck can quickly establish a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent. The deck also has access to Nissa, Who Shakes the World for additional ramp and power. With a mix of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells like Brazen Borrower, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain control throughout the game."
