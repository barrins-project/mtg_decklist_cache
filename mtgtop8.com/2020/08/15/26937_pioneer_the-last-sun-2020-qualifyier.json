The inclusion of Mausoleum Wanderer and Nebelgast Herald provides additional disruption and utility, while Empyrean Eagle and Watcher of the Spheres boost the power of the team. Overall, the deck is designed to apply pressure and close out games quickly."

It utilizes counterspells like Neutralize, Censor, and Absorb to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also having board wipes like Supreme Verdict to deal with threats on the board. Card advantage is gained through Dig Through Time, Mazemind Tome, and Omen of the Sea. The win condition comes from generating flying Shark tokens with Shark Typhoon, while also having planeswalkers like Teferi, Time Raveler and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria to provide additional value and control the game."
