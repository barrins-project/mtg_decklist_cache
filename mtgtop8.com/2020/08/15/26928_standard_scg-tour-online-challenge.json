The deck aims to control the board with cards like Extinction Event and Heartless Act, while generating card advantage and gaining life with Uro and Hydroid Krasis. By slowly grinding out value and answers, the deck seeks to outlast and overwhelm the opponent in a long game scenario, ultimately coming out ahead through attrition and resource management."
