By utilizing cards like Claim the Firstborn and Priest of Forgotten Gods, the player can take control of their opponent's creatures and sacrifice them for their own benefit. Mayhem Devil and Woe Strider provide additional synergy with sacrificing creatures, dealing damage to the opponent while generating value. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and resource management, utilizing key cards like Rankle, Master of Pranks and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger for additional disruption and pressure."

The deck includes sacrifice outlets like Priest of Forgotten Gods and Woe Strider to enable recurring value, as well as ways to protect Winota such as Selfless Savior. Claim the Firstborn can also disrupt the opponent's board while providing additional triggers for Winota. Overall, the strategy focuses on overwhelming the opponent with a combination of speed, synergy, and value."
