The inclusion of Curse of the Pierced Heart provides additional damage over time, while Searing Blaze offers removal options. The deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can establish their own board presence."

The deck also includes cards like Drift of Phantasms and Lead the Stampede to help find combo pieces and maintain card advantage. Additionally, there are some utility creatures like Mulldrifter and Vivien's Grizzly to provide additional value. The overall strategy is to assemble the combo pieces quickly and overwhelm the opponent with powerful spells."
