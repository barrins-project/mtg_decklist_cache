The deck focuses on controlling the board with removal from Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon while also utilizing tutors like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to find the necessary pieces. The deck's win conditions include powerful finishers like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Walking Ballista."
