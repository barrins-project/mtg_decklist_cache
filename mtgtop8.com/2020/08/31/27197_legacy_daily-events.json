            "notes": "This deck is focused on quickly getting out powerful creatures like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Griselbrand by utilizing the combo of Show and Tell and Sneak Attack. The goal is to cheat these creatures into play early in the game to overwhelm the opponent and secure a victory. The deck includes a mix of card drawing, counterspells, and mana acceleration to ensure the combo pieces can be assembled and executed efficiently. It relies on these key components to win games and establish dominance in the Legacy 1 vs 1 format."
