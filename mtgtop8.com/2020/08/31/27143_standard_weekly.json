It also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Narset, Parter of Veils and Nissa, Who Shakes the World to generate card advantage and ramp into bigger threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Hydroid Krasis. The deck aims to stall the game until it can resolve game-ending threats like Elder Gargaroth and Casualties of War, while also having Shark Typhoon as a versatile win condition. It excels at out-valuing and out-lasting opponents through a combination of removal, threats, and card advantage."
