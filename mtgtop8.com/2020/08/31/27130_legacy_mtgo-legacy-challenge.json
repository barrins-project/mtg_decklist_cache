It aims to draw cards and generate mana by chaining together spells like Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith, eventually leading to a win condition like Craterhoof Behemoth with Natural Order. The deck also includes disruption elements like Allosaurus Shepherd and Archon of Valor's Reach to protect the combo. Overall, the deck's strategy revolves around overwhelming the opponent with a large board state and finishing them off with a powerful creature."
