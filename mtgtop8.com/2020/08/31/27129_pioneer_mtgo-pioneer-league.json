The deck aims to control the board state with Supreme Verdict and Warrant/Warden while generating threats with Shark Typhoon. The mana base allows for consistent access to both white and blue mana sources, with utility lands like Castle Ardenvale and Field of Ruin for additional benefits. Overall, the deck focuses on outlasting opponents and winning through attrition."
