The deck utilizes a variety of removal spells, counter magic, and planeswalkers to maintain board control. It also includes cards that allow for recurring threats and generating value from the graveyard. The inclusion of Yorion as a companion provides additional value by blinking permanents and triggering enter-the-battlefield effects. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind out a win through attrition."
