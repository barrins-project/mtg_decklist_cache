By utilizing cards like Rankle, Master of Pranks and Murderous Rider for removal and disruption, the deck aims to control the pace of the game and pressure the opponent. Additionally, the inclusion of Demonic Embrace allows for additional reach and evasion, while the mana base and utility lands like Castle Locthwain provide consistency and card advantage. Overall, the strategy revolves around early aggression and maintaining pressure throughout the game."

By disrupting the opponent's gameplan with cards like Thought Erasure, Eliminate, and Narset, Parter of Veils, while also ramping up with Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Nissa, Who Shakes the World, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Shark Typhoon and Brazen Borrower provides additional ways to interact with the opponent and close out the game. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's triple-color requirements while also ensuring consistency."
