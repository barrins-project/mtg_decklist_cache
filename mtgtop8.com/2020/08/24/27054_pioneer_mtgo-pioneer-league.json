The inclusion of counterspells like Stubborn Denial provides protection for your key threats, while cards like Shadowspear and Ghostfire Blade provide additional utility and flexibility in combat.

The deck also utilizes cards like Growth Spiral and Satyr Wayfinder to ramp and fix mana. The inclusion of The Immortal Sun provides additional card draw and shuts down opposing planeswalkers. The key strategy of this deck is to control the game and outvalue the opponent through a mix of disruption, card advantage, and threats."
