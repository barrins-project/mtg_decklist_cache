The creatures also have strong abilities that can work together to create a win condition, such as draining the opponent's life with Zulaport Cutthroat or creating a loop with persist creatures like Young Wolf."

By putting pressure on the opponent early in the game and efficiently using direct damage spells, the deck aims to finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. The creature base consists of fast and efficient attackers like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, while the burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike provide additional reach to close out the game. The deck aims to win the game as quickly as possible through a combination of creature damage and direct damage spells."
