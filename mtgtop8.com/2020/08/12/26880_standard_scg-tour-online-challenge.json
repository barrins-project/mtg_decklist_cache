The deck also includes counterspells like Ionize and tempo plays like Unsummon to disrupt the opponent's game plan. By utilizing the evasive abilities of creatures like Sea-Dasher Octopus and Sprite Dragon, the deck aims to close out the game swiftly with cards like Embercleave and Stormwing Entity. Additionally, the deck includes card draw effects like Opt to maintain resources and ensure a steady stream of threats."
