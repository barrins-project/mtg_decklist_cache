By utilizing cards like Aether Vial and Cavern of Souls to cheat mana costs and protect creatures, the deck can quickly build a strong board presence. Cards like Reflector Mage and Meddling Mage disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Champion of the Parish and Thalia's Lieutenant grow in power as more creatures are played. This deck aims to apply constant pressure and win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
