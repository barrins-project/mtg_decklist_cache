Cards like Goblin Lackey and Goblin Matron help to search for key pieces, while Goblin Warchief and Goblin Chieftain give all Goblins on the field a boost. With the fast mana acceleration of Skirk Prospector and Chrome Mox, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a horde of aggressive Goblins in order to quickly close out the game."
