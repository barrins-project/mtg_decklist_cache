By utilizing cards like Mystical Dispute, Negate, and Aether Gust, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while generating value through cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Growth Spiral. The deck also aims to ramp up mana quickly with cards like Wilderness Reclamation and Fabled Passage, allowing for explosive plays like casting Expansion / Explosion or Shark Typhoon. The overall strategy is to out-value and outlast the opponent in a long game."
