It also includes planeswalkers like Teferi, Master of Time and Narset, Parter of Veils to provide additional value and control. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents through card advantage and efficient answers, ultimately establishing dominance through its strong control elements. The mana base is designed to support the control strategy by providing consistent access to the necessary colors for spells and creatures."
