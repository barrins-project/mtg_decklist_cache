By utilizing cards like Footlight Fiend, Anax, Hardened in the Forge, and Phoenix of Ash, alongside direct damage spells like Shock and Light Up the Stage, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast-paced aggression. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion allows for even more damage output. The goal is to close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
