The key strategy is to get out creatures like Fervent Champion and Anax, Hardened in the Forge early on, while using support cards like Embercleave to increase damage output. Torbran, Thane of Red Fell boosts damage from red sources, making the deck even more effective at quickly finishing off opponents. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast, high damage output to secure a swift victory."
