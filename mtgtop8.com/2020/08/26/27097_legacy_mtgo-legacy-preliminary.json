The deck focuses on quickly deploying threats like Delver of Secrets and Dreadhorde Arcanist, backed up by countermagic like Force of Will and disruption like Daze and Spell Pierce. The inclusion of powerful cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns enables the deck to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also providing additional threats. Overall, the deck aims to quickly close out games through aggression and disruption."
