            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the game by using a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to prevent the opponent from executing their game plan effectively. By utilizing Wilderness Reclamation to generate additional mana and Shark Typhoon to create blockers or close out the game, this deck aims to outvalue the opponent and take control of the board. With a mix of tempo plays and big threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, this deck seeks to outlast its opponents and win through attrition."
