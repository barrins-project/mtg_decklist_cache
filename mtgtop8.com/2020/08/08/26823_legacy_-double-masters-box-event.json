It also aims to aggressively deploy threats like Mirran Crusader and Flickerwisp to pressure the opponent. The deck synergizes well with equipment cards like Umezawa's Jitte and Stoneforge Mystic to further enhance its board presence. Additionally, the mana denial strategy with cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port helps to control the opponent's resources. Overall, this deck aims to quickly overwhelm opponents with a mix of disruptive elements and aggressive creatures."

The inclusion of disruptive cards like Wasteland and Pithing Needle further adds to the controlling nature of the deck, making it difficult for the opponent to execute their own game plan."
