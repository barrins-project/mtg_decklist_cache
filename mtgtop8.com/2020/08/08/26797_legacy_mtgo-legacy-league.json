The deck also includes efficient burn spells like Chain Lightning, Lightning Bolt, and Price of Progress to deal direct damage and control the board. By playing disruptive counterspells like Daze, Force of Will, and Force of Negation, the deck aims to protect its threats and maintain tempo advantage. With a mana base centered around fetch lands, dual lands, and cantrips, the deck prioritizes consistency and speed in executing its game plan."
