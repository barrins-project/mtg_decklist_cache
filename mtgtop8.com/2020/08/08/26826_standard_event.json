The deck aims to apply pressure early on with creatures like Knight of the Ebon Legion and Spawn of Mayhem, while using removal spells like Eliminate to deal with threats from the opponent. Demonic Embrace can be used to further enhance the aggression of the deck, allowing for explosive turns and finishing off the opponent quickly. The deck's focus is on dealing damage efficiently and closing out games before the opponent can stabilize."
