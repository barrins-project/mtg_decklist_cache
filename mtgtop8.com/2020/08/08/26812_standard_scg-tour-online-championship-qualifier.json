The deck also includes powerful control cards like Thought Erasure and Casualties of War to handle a variety of threats. Nissa, Who Shakes the World provides additional ramp and board presence, while Narset, Parter of Veils and Tamiyo, Collector of Tales offer card advantage and disruptive abilities.
