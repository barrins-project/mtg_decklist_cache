This combo allows for powerful creatures like Griselbrand and Elesh Norn to hit the battlefield much earlier than usual, overwhelming the opponent with their abilities and stats. The deck also includes disruptive cards like Unmask and Thoughtseize to protect the combo and ensure its success, creating a fast and deadly reanimation strategy."
