            "notes": "The main concept of this Sultai Control deck is to utilize a combination of powerful control cards and powerful card advantage engines to disrupt the opponent's strategy and outvalue them in the late game. With cards like Hydroid Krasis and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath providing card draw and life gain, alongside counter spells like Negate and Aether Gust, the deck aims to control the board and gradually pull ahead in resources. Additionally, cards like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Shark Typhoon provide powerful win conditions to close out the game once the opponent is locked down."
