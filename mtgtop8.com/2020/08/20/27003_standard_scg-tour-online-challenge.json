Using cards like Mystical Dispute and Aether Gust to disrupt the opponent's strategy, while also generating card advantage with Boon of the Wish-Giver and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. Additionally, the deck utilizes Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse to create a board presence and apply pressure on the opponent. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency in casting spells of all colors."
