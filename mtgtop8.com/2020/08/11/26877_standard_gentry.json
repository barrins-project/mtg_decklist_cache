By combining cards like Griffin Aerie, Silversmote Ghoul, and Indulging Patrician with lifegain effects such as Revitalize and Light of Hope, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and outvalue opponents. Additionally, powerful threats like Basilica Bell-Haunt and Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose provide additional disruption and damage potential to push through the final points of damage needed for victory."
