By playing efficient threats like Uro and Hydroid Krasis, along with disruption like Aether Gust and Thought Erasure, the deck aims to control the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful late-game threats like Nissa and Casualties of War. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements while also providing flexibility and consistency in casting its spells."
