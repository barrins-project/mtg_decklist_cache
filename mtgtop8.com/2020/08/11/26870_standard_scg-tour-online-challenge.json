The deck aims to ramp up quickly with cards like Cultivate and Nissa, Who Shakes the World, while also generating card advantage with Teferi, Master of Time and Hydroid Krasis. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides additional ramp and life gain. The deck also includes versatile threats like Brazen Borrower and powerful finishers like Hydroid Krasis to out-value and out-last opponents."
