By constantly gaining life, the player can continually buff their creatures, create extra tokens, and maintain a constant stream of pressure on the opponent. The deck focuses on overwhelming the opponent with a steady stream of low-cost creatures and using lifegain effects to maintain control of the board while steadily building towards a win condition."
