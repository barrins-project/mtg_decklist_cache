The goal is to quickly ramp up and overwhelm the opponent with big creatures like Beanstalk Giant and Lovestruck Beast while also having the flexibility to answer threats with Brazen Borrower and Bonecrusher Giant. Fae of Wishes provides additional utility by granting access to a sideboard toolbox of powerful spells, giving the deck a versatile and proactive game plan."
