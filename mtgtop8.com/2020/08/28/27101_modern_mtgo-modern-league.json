The deck focuses on getting lands onto the battlefield to activate Valakut's ability and win the game through a large burst of damage. The strategy involves finding the right balance between ramping mana, searching for key cards, and controlling the opponent's board to set up the combo win condition."

            "notes": "This deck revolves around disrupting the opponent's hand and board through discard spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, as well as removal like Fatal Push and Smallpox. It punishes the opponent for having few cards in hand with cards like The Rack and Shrieking Affliction, putting pressure on them to keep cards in hand. Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and control elements. The key strategy is to strip the opponent's hand while using discard and removal spells to keep the board clear, ultimately winning through attrition and incremental damage."
