The deck also includes card draw and recursion to maintain tempo and keep the pressure on the opponent."

It focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Agonizing Remorse, while also ramping up mana and generating card advantage with Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Hydroid Krasis. The deck also includes removal spells like Eliminate and Heartless Act, as well as powerful board wipes like Extinction Event and Casualties of War to deal with threats on the board. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue the opponent and secure a win through superior card advantage and control."
