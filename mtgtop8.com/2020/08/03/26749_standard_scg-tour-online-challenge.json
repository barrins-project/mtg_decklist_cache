With strong finishers like Shark Typhoon, Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and Nightpack Ambusher, the deck can close out games once the opponent is depleted of resources. The key is to maintain control of the game until victory is assured."

Cards like Scorch Spitter and Fervent Champion help maintain pressure on the opponent while cards like Castle Embereth and Light Up the Stage ensure consistent card advantage and mana efficiency. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient creatures and burn spells to secure a quick victory."
