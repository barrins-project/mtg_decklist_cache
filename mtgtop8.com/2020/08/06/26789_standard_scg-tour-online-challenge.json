Cards like Runaway Steam-Kin and Anax, Hardened in the Forge help to maintain pressure on the opponent while cards like Embercleave provide additional burst damage. By utilizing a mix of creatures with haste and burn spells like Shock, the deck aims to close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize. Castle Embereth also provides additional reach in the late game to secure victory."
