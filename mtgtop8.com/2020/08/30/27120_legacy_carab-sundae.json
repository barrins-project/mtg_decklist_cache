The deck focuses on tempo plays, using cards like Daze and Spell Pierce to keep the opponent off balance while efficiently cycling through the deck with cantrips like Ponder and Brainstorm. The mana base is optimized for consistency and the sideboard can be tailored to handle specific matchups, making it a versatile and powerful aggro deck in the Legacy format."
