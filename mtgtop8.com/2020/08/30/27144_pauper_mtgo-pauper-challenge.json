This deck also gains incremental life with God-Pharaoh's Faithful while digging deeper into the library with Preordain and Deep Analysis. The inclusion of Sunscape Familiar allows for cost reduction on white and blue spells, making this control deck more efficient and resilient against aggressive strategies."
