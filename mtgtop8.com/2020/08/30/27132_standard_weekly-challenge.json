The deck also includes Knights with synergy abilities like Worthy Knight and Corpse Knight to further enhance the attack strategy. Additionally, the inclusion of the Companion, Lurrus of the Dream-Den, allows for recursion and additional value through its ability to bring back small creatures from the graveyard."
