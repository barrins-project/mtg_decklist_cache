This allows the player to cast powerful spells like Dig Through Time and Finale of Revelation, while also searching for specific cards with Fae of Wishes. The deck also includes Sylvan Scrying and Strategic Planning to help find Lotus Field, along with Pore Over the Pages for card draw. Ultimately, the goal is to establish an overwhelming advantage and win the game through a massive spell or combo finish."

The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's five-color requirements, allowing for flexibility in casting spells of different colors.

The deck also includes disruptive cards like Gideon of the Trials and Teferi, Time Raveler to control the opponent's board. With a mix of removal spells like Supreme Verdict and counterspells like Spell Pierce, the deck aims to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent while controlling the tempo of the game. The mana base allows for flexibility in casting spells of both colors efficiently."
