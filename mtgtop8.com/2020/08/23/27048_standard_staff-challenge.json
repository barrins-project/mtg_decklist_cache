By efficiently using mana and maximizing creature damage, the deck aims to establish board dominance early and maintain pressure throughout the game. With a strong mix of creatures and spells, the deck can quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The key strategy is to play high-value creatures like Lovestruck Beast and Questing Beast while leveraging combat tricks like Embercleave and Domri's Ambush to push through damage and secure victories."
