The deck also includes threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Hydroid Krasis to provide card advantage and close out the game. Shark Typhoon can provide an evasive win condition, and cards like Aether Gust and Eat to Extinction can deal with problematic permanents. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and outvalue the opponent in the late game."
