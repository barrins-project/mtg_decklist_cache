It takes advantage of cards like Risen Reef and Leafkin Druid to accelerate the mana base and generate value. The deck is designed to overwhelm opponents with large creatures and efficient removal spells, while also having card advantage with Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion and Genesis Ultimatum to refill the hand. The key strategy is to establish board presence and consistently apply pressure to the opponent."
