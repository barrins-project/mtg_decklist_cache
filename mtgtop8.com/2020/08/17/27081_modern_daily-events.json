By quickly deploying low-cost creatures and using cards like Heliod, Sun-Crowned and Ranger-Captain of Eos to maximize their potential, the deck aims to pressure the opponent early and maintain a strong board presence. Cards like Giver of Runes and Isamaru, Hound of Konda help protect key creatures, while also utilizing artifacts like Mox Amber to accelerate the deck's game plan. The deck also includes disruption spells like On Thin Ice to control the opponent's board and tempo."
