It aims to bypass traditional mana costs and disrupt opponents using counter spells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce. The deck includes card draw and manipulation to find key combo pieces quickly. Overall, the strategy revolves around cheating big creatures into play early and overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats."
