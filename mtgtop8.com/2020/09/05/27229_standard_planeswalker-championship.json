It aims to stabilize the board with cards like Extinction Event and Casualties of War, while generating card advantage with Narset, Parter of Veils and Nissa, Who Shakes the World. The deck also includes finishers like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Hydroid Krasis to close out the game once control has been established. It's a grindy, value-focused deck that aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent."
