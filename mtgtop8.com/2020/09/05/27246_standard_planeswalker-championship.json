By utilizing a mix of counter spells, creature removal, and card draw, the deck aims to keep the opponent on the back foot while developing its own board presence. The inclusion of tempo-based creatures like Brineborn Cutthroat and Brazen Borrower helps to apply pressure while disrupting the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck is built to apply early pressure, maintain control, and finish off the opponent with a strong, aggressive strategy."

By utilizing creatures like Lovestruck Beast, Questing Beast, and Garruk's Harbinger, along with efficient support cards like Primal Might and The Great Henge, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain board presence. Additionally, cards like Scavenging Ooze and Stonecoil Serpent provide versatility and utility in different situations. The inclusion of cards like Vivien, Arkbow Ranger and Gemrazer offer additional flexibility and options for dealing with various threats. Overall, the deck focuses on fast, aggressive gameplay to take control of the game."
