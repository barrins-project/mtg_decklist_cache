The deck's strategy is to efficiently use cheap spells like Lava Dart and Chain Lightning to clear the way for higher-cost cards like Bedlam Reveler, while also maintaining card advantage with Faithless Looting and Light Up the Stage. The inclusion of cards like Abrade and Gut Shot allows for flexibility in dealing with opposing threats."
