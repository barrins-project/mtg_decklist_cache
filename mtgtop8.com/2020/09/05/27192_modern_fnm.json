            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing low-cost creatures and burn spells to deal damage quickly and efficiently to the opponent. By having Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion, all odd-costed damage sources become more potent, increasing the deck's overall aggressiveness. With a combination of creatures like Soul-Scar Mage, Monastery Swiftspear, and Bonecrusher Giant, along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Burst Lightning, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a strong and relentless offensive strategy, ultimately leading to a fast victory."

The deck aims to draw out the game and out-value the opponent using powerful planeswalkers like Jace and Teferi. The key strategy is to control the board and limit the opponent's resources while generating advantage through card draw and recursion with Mystic Sanctuary and Snapcaster Mage. By maintaining control of the game, the deck seeks to establish dominance and eventually win through attrition and incremental advantages."
