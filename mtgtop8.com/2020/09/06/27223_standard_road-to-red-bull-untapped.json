The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thought Erasure and Mystical Dispute, while deploying threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Hydroid Krasis to close out the game. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Nissa, Who Shakes the World and Narset, Parter of Veils provide additional advantage and pressure on the opponent. Overall, this deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through efficient control and powerful finishers."
