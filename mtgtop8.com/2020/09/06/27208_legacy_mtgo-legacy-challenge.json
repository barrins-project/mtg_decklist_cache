By cheating these big creatures into play early, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents before they have a chance to react. The deck includes counterspells like Force of Will and Daze to protect its combo pieces and can quickly dig through the deck with cantrips like Brainstorm, Preordain, and Ponder to find the necessary combo pieces."
