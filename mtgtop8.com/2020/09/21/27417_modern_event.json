Finale of Devastation is a powerful card that can search for and put a creature onto the battlefield. Mishra's Bauble allows for deck manipulation and can be sacrificed to trigger various effects. The deck also includes various mana dorks for acceleration and protection, such as Noble Hierarch and Birds of Paradise.
