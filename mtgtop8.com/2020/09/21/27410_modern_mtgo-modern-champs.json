The key strategy is to deal damage as quickly as possible to the opponent, utilizing cards like Blistercoil Weird, Monastery Swiftspear, and Lightning Bolt to clear the way. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion adds an extra power boost to all Odd converted mana cost cards in the deck. Overall, the goal is to be fast and relentless in dealing damage to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
