By utilizing Vengevine and Bridge from Below, the deck can create a strong board presence and overwhelm opponents with a powerful graveyard recursion engine. Altar of Dementia is used as a win condition to mill out the opponent's deck while also fueling your own graveyard strategy. Cabal Therapy helps disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect your own combo pieces."

The deck also uses efficient removal in the form of Lightning Bolt and Ice-Fang Coatl to deal with threats.
