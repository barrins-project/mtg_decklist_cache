It also includes control elements like Thundering Rebuke to take out opposing threats. Uro provides card advantage and life gain, while Kenrith gives flexibility and utility. Lotus Cobra helps ramp up mana even further, while Terror of the Peaks can deal massive damage. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful plays and efficient mana usage, dominating the mid to late game with its ramp and control elements."
