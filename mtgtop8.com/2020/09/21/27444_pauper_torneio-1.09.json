By utilizing cards like Ethereal Armor and Cartouche of Solidarity, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of small but powerful creatures. The inclusion of protection spells like Karametra's Blessing and Emerge Unscathed helps to keep the key creatures alive and maintain pressure on the opponent. Overall, the deck focuses on quickly building a strong board state and closing out the game swiftly."

By bouncing artifacts like Bonder's Ornament and Great Furnace with cards like Glint Hawk and Kor Skyfisher, the deck can draw cards and generate mana advantage. Removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast help clear the way for the creatures to attack. The deck also has some lifegain with Lone Missionary and can generate value through recursion with cards like Archaeomancer and Mulldrifter. Overall, the deck aims to be aggressive while maintaining card advantage and board control."
