It also utilizes powerful threats like Uro and Hydroid Krasis to generate card advantage and stabilize the board. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thought Erasure and Agonizing Remorse, while also having access to counter spells like Disdainful Stroke and Aether Gust to protect its own threats."
