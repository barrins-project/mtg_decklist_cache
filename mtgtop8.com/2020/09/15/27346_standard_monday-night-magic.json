By constantly putting pressure on your opponent's life total and using cards like Embercleave to finish them off quickly, this deck aims to win the game as fast as possible before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. It's all about speed, aggression, and utilizing the strength of red creatures and burn spells to secure victory."
