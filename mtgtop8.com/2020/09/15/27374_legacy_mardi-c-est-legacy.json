The deck also includes cards like Wishclaw Talisman and Duress to disrupt the opponent's strategy, while cards like Brainstorm and Ponder help to dig for key combo pieces. The goal is to assemble the necessary cards to go off and win the game before the opponent can react."

The deck aims to close out games quickly by overwhelming the opponent with direct damage, while also utilizing cards like Price of Progress and Eidolon of the Great Revel to punish any attempts at stabilizing the board. This aggro-burn archetype is designed to apply constant pressure and finish the game before the opponent can mount a defense."
