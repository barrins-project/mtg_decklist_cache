The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's plans and tempo while applying pressure on their life total. By efficiently using counter spells like Mana Leak and Remand, along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt, the deck seeks to outmaneuver the opponent and secure victory through a combination of control and aggression."
