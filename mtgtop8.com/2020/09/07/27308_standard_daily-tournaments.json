The deck utilizes cards like Shark Typhoon and Niv-Mizzet, Parun to generate card advantage and apply pressure on the opponent. It also includes cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse for value and flexibility. The mana base is built around the Temur colors, allowing for consistent access to all three colors for spells and abilities."
