Gurmag Angler provides a big threat that can come down quickly, and Snapcaster Mage allows you to reuse key spells from your graveyard. Cling to Dust provides additional disruption and life gain, while Stubborn Denial helps protect your threats. The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember to deal with opposing threats. Thought Scour and Mishra's Bauble help dig through your deck and enable delve for Angler and synergy with Snapcaster Mage."
