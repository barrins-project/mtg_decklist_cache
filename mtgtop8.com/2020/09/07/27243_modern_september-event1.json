The deck also utilizes land destruction with Boom / Bust and Greater Gargadon, while also having utility lands like Kher Keep and Sunbaked Canyon to provide additional benefits.

It utilizes cards like Monastery Swiftspear, Soul-Scar Mage, and Kiln Fiend to deal damage rapidly while disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value by recurring low-cost permanents from the graveyard. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive playstyle and ensure consistent access to the necessary colors of mana."
