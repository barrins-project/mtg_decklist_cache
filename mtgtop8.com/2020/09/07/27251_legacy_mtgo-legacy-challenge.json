It also utilizes snow synergies with cards like Dead of Winter and Ice-Fang Coatl to gain incremental advantages. The inclusion of cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provide additional card advantage and win conditions. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's color requirements while also allowing for flexibility in fetching lands. Overall, the key idea is to control the game and grind out incremental advantages to secure victory."
