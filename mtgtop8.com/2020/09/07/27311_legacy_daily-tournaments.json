The deck aims to control the game through tempo plays, using cards like Daze to keep opponents off-balance while applying pressure with cheap and efficient creatures. The mana base is optimized for consistency, with a focus on fetching important dual lands like Volcanic Island and Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's mana base."
