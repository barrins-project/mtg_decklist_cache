The goal is to combo off by creating infinite mana with Axebane Guardian and Freed from the Real, then win the game by casting Bloodrite Invoker or Valakut Invoker. The deck also utilizes recursion with Mnemonic Wall and Pulse of Murasa to protect its combo pieces and keep the engine running smoothly. Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to dig for combo pieces and maintain card advantage, while Saruli Caretaker and Quirion Ranger provide additional mana acceleration."
