By maximizing the power of creatures like Lovestruck Beast, Questing Beast, and Shifting Ceratops, the deck aims to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent early on. Additionally, cards like Primal Might and Garruk's Harbinger provide removal and card advantage to help maintain control of the battlefield. The mana base is streamlined and efficient, allowing for consistent plays and a smooth curve throughout the game."
