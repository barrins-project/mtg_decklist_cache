The deck aims to \"cheat\" these creatures into play before the opponent has a chance to respond, creating a powerful board presence and putting pressure on the opponent to deal with these threats. The deck also includes disruption in the form of discard spells like Thoughtseize and Unmask to disrupt the opponent's game plan while focusing on executing its own combo strategy."
