Overall, the deck aims to control the game through enchantments and outvalue opponents."

The deck aims to control the board with cards like Fiery Confluence and Punishing Fire, while also applying pressure with creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Bonecrusher Giant. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive playstyle and enable the casting of powerful spells early in the game."
