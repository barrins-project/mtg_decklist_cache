The deck also includes efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to control the board and clear a path for our creatures to attack."

The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures that can grow in power rapidly. The Ozolith helps to keep counters in play even if creatures are removed, while Animation Module provides additional ways to generate counters. Walking Ballista and Hangarback Walker can benefit greatly from the abundance of counters, while Arcbound Ravager can sacrifice creatures to distribute even more counters across the board. Overall, the deck aims to win through quick and aggressive plays."
