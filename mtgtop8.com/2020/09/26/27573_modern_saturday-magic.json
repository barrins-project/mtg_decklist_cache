The deck aims to quickly build up its creatures, take advantage of synergies with Arcbound Worker and Throne of Geth, and overwhelm the opponent with large creatures that can quickly close out games. The inclusion of cards like Spellskite and Crystalline Giant offer additional utility and versatility to adapt to different situations."

The combo is centered around Devoted Druid and Vizier of Remedies, allowing for infinite mana and potentially infinite creature search and growth to overwhelm the opponent."
