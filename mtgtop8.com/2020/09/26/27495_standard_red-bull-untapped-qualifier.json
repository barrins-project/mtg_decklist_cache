Bloodchief's Thirst and Drown in the Loch handle threats efficiently, while So Tiny and Hagra Mauling can deal with larger creatures. Into the Story and Silundi Vision provide card advantage, with Maddening Cacophony being a powerful finisher. Soul-Guide Lantern, Mystical Dispute, and Cling to Dust offer additional disruption and graveyard hate."
