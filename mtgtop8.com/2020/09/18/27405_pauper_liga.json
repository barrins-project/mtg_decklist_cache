The deck also includes efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Galvanic Blast to clear the way for its creatures to deal damage. The inclusion of cards like Palace Sentinels and Prismatic Strands help the deck maintain card advantage and protect its creatures. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast, aggressive game plan."
