The deck also utilizes cantrips like Opt and Manamorphose to cycle through the deck and find key cards. The inclusion of Stormwing Entity and Bedlam Reveler provides additional threats and card advantage. Surgical Extraction is included for disruption, while cards like Gut Shot and Mutagenic Growth provide additional reach and removal options."
