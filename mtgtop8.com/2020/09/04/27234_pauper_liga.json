The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by removing threats and delaying their plays until the Dimir player can establish a dominant position on the battlefield. The recursion provided by Archaeomancer and Reaping the Graves allows for the reuse of powerful spells, while Mulldrifter provides card advantage and Chittering Rats disrupts the opponent's hand."

The deck includes powerful creatures like Gurmag Angler and Thorn of the Black Rose to close out the game. The mana base is designed to consistently hit double blue for counterspells while also providing access to black mana for removal spells."
