            "notes": "The main concept of this mono green aggro deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy. By playing powerful and efficient creatures like Stonecoil Serpent, Questing Beast, and Scavenging Ooze, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence. Cards like Primal Might and Garruk's Harbinger help to clear the way for your creatures to attack, while Vivien, Arkbow Ranger provides additional utility and card advantage. The overall goal is to apply constant pressure and defeat the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
