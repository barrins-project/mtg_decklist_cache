This allows the player to constantly revive and reuse powerful creatures like Crypt Rats, Drannith Stinger, and Grave Scrabbler. Additional cards like Golgari Brownscale, Monstrous Carabid, and Kami of False Hope provide support and protection. The deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent with a relentless and resilient combination of creatures and abilities."
