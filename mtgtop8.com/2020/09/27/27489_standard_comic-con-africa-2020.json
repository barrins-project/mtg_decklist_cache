The inclusion of cards like Brazen Borrower and Ashiok, Nightmare Muse allow for disruption of the opponent's strategy, while cards like Extinction Event and Heartless Act provide additional removal options. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by generating card advantage through cards like Clearwater Pathway and Castle Locthwain, while also having the flexibility to win through either creature beats or a large Shark Typhoon token army."
