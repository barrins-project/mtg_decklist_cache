The goal is to apply pressure early on with cheap threats and maintain tempo advantage through card advantage engines like Dreadhorde Arcanist and Brainstorm. The deck aims to quickly close out the game by overwhelming the opponent with its efficient threats and disruption."

Burning Wish allows the player to access their sideboard for additional combo pieces or protection. The deck aims to finish the game by casting Tendrils of Agony or Ad Nauseam for a lethal storm count."

The deck includes key cards like Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith to keep the elf engine running smoothly. By playing efficient creatures and utilizing cards like Heritage Druid and Wirewood Symbiote, the deck aims to quickly ramp up mana production and overwhelm the opponent with a powerful board presence. Natural Order serves as a powerful finisher to bring out key threats like Craterhoof Behemoth."
