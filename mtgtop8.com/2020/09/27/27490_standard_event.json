Additional support comes from cards like Robber of the Rich and Bonecrusher Giant. Torbran, Thane of Red Fell boosts the damage output from red sources, while Anax, Hardened in the Forge provides resilience and token generation. Embercleave serves as a powerful finisher, while removal spells like Shock and Spikefield Hazard help control the board. Castle Embereth provides additional damage potential."
