The deck aims to efficiently use its resources, such as cantrips and efficient mana bases, to maximize its chances of victory through early pressure and disruption. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse provides additional versatility and power to the deck's game plan."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's mana base by utilizing cards like Blood Moon, Magus of the Moon, and Trinisphere, while also putting pressure on the opponent with aggressive creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Legion Warboss. The deck also utilizes artifact hate with Karn, the Great Creator and Chalice of the Void to control the board and prevent the opponent from advancing their game plan. The goal is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a combination of disruptive elements and powerful creatures."
