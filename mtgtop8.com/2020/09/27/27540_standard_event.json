By playing a mix of efficient creatures like Thieves' Guild Enforcer and Merfolk Windrobber alongside disruptive spells like Bloodchief's Thirst and Drown in the Loch, the deck aims to control the board and chip away at the opponent's life total. With the ability to quickly close out games with evasive threats like Nighthawk Scavenger and Brazen Borrower, the deck looks to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent in order to secure victory."
