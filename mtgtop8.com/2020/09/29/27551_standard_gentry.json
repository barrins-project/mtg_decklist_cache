The deck focuses on stalling the opponent's game plan with cards like Pestilent Haze and Eliminate while also disrupting their card advantage with counterspells like Didn't Say Please and Anticognition. Teferi's Tutelage and Frantic Inventory provide card draw to help dig through the deck for key cards like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon or Ashiok, Nightmare Muse. With a mix of control elements and win conditions, this deck aims to grind the opponent out in a long game."
