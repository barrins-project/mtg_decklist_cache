The deck focuses on ramping up mana with cards like Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves to play bigger threats earlier. The creatures in the deck, such as Lovestruck Beast, Leonin Warleader, and Voice of Resurgence, provide a strong board presence and can quickly deal damage to the opponent. The deck also includes tools like Declaration in Stone and Dromoka's Command to control the opponent's board and disrupt their strategy. Overall, the key concept is to establish a fast and aggressive presence on the battlefield."
