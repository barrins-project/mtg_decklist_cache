The inclusion of Primeval Titan and Hour of Promise provides additional win conditions, while Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath offers card advantage and life gain. Wrenn and Six helps to recur lands and provide extra value, making this deck a resilient and versatile control archetype."

The deck also utilizes cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to find the UrzaTron lands efficiently. Control elements are included in the form of Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, Karn Liberated, and Karn, the Great Creator to deal with threats and disrupt the opponent's strategy.
