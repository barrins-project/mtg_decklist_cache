The deck also utilizes creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Scourge of the Skyclaves to apply pressure early on. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for additional value by reusing low-cost permanents from the graveyard. The deck aims to win quickly through a combination of damage and control."
