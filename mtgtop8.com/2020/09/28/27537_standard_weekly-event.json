Using Lucky Clover and Edgewall Innkeeper to generate extra value, the deck can control the board with removal spells like Bonecrusher Giant and Brazen Borrower while also setting up for big plays with Fae of Wishes. The goal is to out-value and out-maneuver opponents by accelerating mana production and utilizing versatile cards to maintain board control. By balancing aggression with control, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures and spells."
