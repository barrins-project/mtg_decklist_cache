The strategy revolves around synergy between creatures that provide a strong defense while buffing each other, with the goal of overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of creatures. The inclusion of cards like Selfless Savior and Glass Casket allows for protection and removal options, making the deck versatile in different situations. The primary goal is to establish a wide board presence and keep the pressure on the opponent early in the game."
