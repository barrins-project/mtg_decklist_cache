It also utilizes Nissa of Shadowed Boughs to reanimate key creatures and provide card advantage. By controlling the board with removal spells and countering opponent's threats, the deck aims to stabilize the game and overwhelm the opponent with big creatures like Ulamog and World Breaker. The mana base is designed to support a variety of colors and efficiently cast the spells in the deck."
