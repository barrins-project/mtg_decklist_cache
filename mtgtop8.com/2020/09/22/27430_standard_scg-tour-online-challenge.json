Once enough mana is generated, the player can cast powerful spells like Genesis Ultimatum and Felidar Retreat to overwhelm their opponent. Omnath, Locus of Creation serves as a key card in this deck, providing additional ramp and card draw. Kenrith, the Returned King can provide flexibility and utility in various situations. Overall, the goal is to outvalue and outpace the opponent while maintaining control of the game."
