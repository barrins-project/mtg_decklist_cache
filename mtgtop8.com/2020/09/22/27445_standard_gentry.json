By utilizing cards like Cultivate and Vastwood Surge, the deck aims to accelerate its mana production and outvalue the opponent in the late game. The game plan involves stalling the opponent with counterspells like Didn't Say Please and removal spells like Fire Prophecy, while also setting up big plays with cards like Genesis Ultimatum and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The deck ultimately aims to overpower the opponent with a combination of strong threats and efficient card advantage."
