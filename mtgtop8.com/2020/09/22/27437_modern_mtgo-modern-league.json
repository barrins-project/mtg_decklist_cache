The deck aims to use cards like Leonin Arbiter to hinder the opponent's land searches, Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to make their noncreature spells more expensive, and Flickerwisp and Restoration Angel to bounce or exile their key threats. The deck can also generate card advantage and maintain tempo with cards like Charming Prince and Skyclave Apparition."

The deck aims to create a strong board presence through the combo of Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek, generating a steady stream of artifact creatures. It also has access to various artifact removal and counter spells like Galvanic Blast, Metallic Rebuke, and Whir of Invention. The deck also includes cards like Damping Sphere and Ensnaring Bridge to slow down aggressive opponents. Urza, Lord High Artificer serves as the main win condition and card advantage engine."
