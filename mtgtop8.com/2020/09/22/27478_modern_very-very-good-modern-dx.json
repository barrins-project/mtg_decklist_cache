Protection spells like Spellskite and Blossoming Defense help protect your creatures from removal spells, while also using cards like Spell Pierce to disrupt your opponent's game plan. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with infect damage before they can establish a defense."

By generating a large amount of mana with cards like Lotus Bloom and Pentad Prism, the player can cast Ad Nauseam to draw their entire deck. Thassa's Oracle is used to win the game by ensuring that the player has fewer cards in their library than their life total. The deck also includes ways to protect the combo with cards like Angel's Grace and Pact of Negation. The goal is to win the game in a single explosive turn."

Once enough lands are on the battlefield, Primeval Titan can search for more lands to trigger Valakut's ability to deal damage to the opponent. The deck also has removal spells like Path to Exile and board control with cards like Knight of Autumn and Ghost Quarter. Castle Garenbrig and Arboreal Grazer help to accelerate mana production, allowing for explosive combos with multiple land drops in a turn."
