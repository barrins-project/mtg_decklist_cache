Utilizing burn spells like Wild Slash and Fatal Push, along with removal like Dreadbore and Claim / Fame, the deck aims to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Thoughtseize helps to strip away key cards from the opponent's hand. Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger provides a powerful finisher, with Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a potential companion for added value."
