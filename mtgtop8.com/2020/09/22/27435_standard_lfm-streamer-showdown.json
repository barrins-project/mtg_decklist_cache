The deck also utilizes adventure cards like Beanstalk Giant and Edgewall Innkeeper to generate card advantage and maintain tempo. With ramp cards like Lotus Cobra and Radha, Heart of Keld, the deck can quickly ramp into powerful threats like Embercleave to close out games. The mana base is optimized for consistency with a mix of lands that provide both green and red mana sources."
