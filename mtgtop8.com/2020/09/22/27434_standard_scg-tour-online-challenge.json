With the help of Omnath, Locus of Creation, the deck can generate even more mana and trigger powerful abilities. Control elements like Spikefield Hazard and Bonecrusher Giant help to control the board while Evolving Wilds and Fabled Passage ensure mana fixing. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with big plays and card advantage while maintaining control of the game."
