By curving out with powerful knights such as Knight of the Ebon Legion and Embercleave to deliver significant damage, this deck aims to close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize. The mix of removal spells like Heartless Act and flexible combat tricks like Fight as One allows for adaptability in dealing with threats while maintaining pressure on the opponent."
