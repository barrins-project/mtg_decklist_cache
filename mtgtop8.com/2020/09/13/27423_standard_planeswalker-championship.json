The key strategy revolves around sacrificing expendable creatures for value with cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods and Village Rites, while also utilizing synergy with cards like Robber of the Rich and Claim the Firstborn to disrupt the opponent's game plan. By combining efficient creatures with sacrifice and graveyard recursion effects, the deck aims to maintain a steady stream of pressure and disruption to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent."
