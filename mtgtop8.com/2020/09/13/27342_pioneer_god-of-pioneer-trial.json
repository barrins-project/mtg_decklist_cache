By maximizing the use of creatures such as Rotting Regisaur, Garruk's Harbinger, and Thought-Knot Seer, the deck can quickly apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, cards like Primal Might and Blossoming Defense provide essential protection and combat tricks to push through damage and secure victory. The Golgari color combination allows for a versatile and powerful playstyle that can adapt to various matchups effectively."
