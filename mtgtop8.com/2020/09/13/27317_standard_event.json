By using cards like Claim the Firstborn, Call of the Death-Dweller, and Village Rites, along with the powerful companion Lurrus of the Dream-Den, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with constant threats and pressure. The inclusion of cards like Priest of Forgotten Gods and Fiend Artisan further enhance the deck's ability to generate value from sacrificing creatures, making it a formidable Aggro deck in the Standard format."
