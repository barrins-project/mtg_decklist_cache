Once enough mana is accumulated, the deck aims to win the game by casting a powerful creature like Craterhoof Behemoth through Natural Order. The deck also utilizes creatures with tap abilities like Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger to generate additional mana and/or untap creatures for extra value. The synergy between the various Elves in the deck allows for explosive turns and fast wins."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly establishing board presence and applying pressure to the opponent through efficient creatures and countermagic. By utilizing cards like Delver of Secrets, Tarmogoyf, and Dreadhorde Arcanist, along with disruptive spells such as Stifle, Daze, and Force of Will, the deck aims to control the pace of the game and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base enables flexibility in casting spells across all colors, while cards like Lightning Bolt and Oko, Thief of Crowns provide additional utility and removal options."

Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith are key cards that help keep the combo going by drawing more cards and tutoring for necessary pieces. The deck focuses on explosive turns where the player can overwhelm the opponent with a massive board presence and powerful creatures, ultimately leading to a swift victory."
