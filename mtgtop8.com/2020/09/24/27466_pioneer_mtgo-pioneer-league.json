It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating value through Teferi planeswalkers and powerful instant-speed spells like Dig Through Time. Utilizing sweepers like Supreme Verdict and utilizing lands like Castle Ardenvale for token generation, it aims to establish board control and win through incremental advantage. With a strong mana base and a mix of proactive and reactive cards, the deck aims to outlast and outplay opponents in a grindy match-up."
