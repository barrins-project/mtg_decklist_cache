The goal is to ramp up mana and overwhelm the opponent with big creatures and powerful spells like Genesis Ultimatum and Escape to the Wilds. Felidar Retreat can also create a swarm of tokens to further pressure the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and win through its ramped-up threats."
