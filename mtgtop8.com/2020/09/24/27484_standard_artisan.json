By utilizing cards like Lucky Clover and Edgewall Innkeeper, the deck can quickly ramp up its board presence and pressure opponents with cheap, efficient creatures. Syr Konrad, the Grim adds a touch of reach and late-game power to finish off opponents. The deck also includes some disruption elements like Agonizing Remorse and removal spells like Heartless Act to maintain board control. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of speed and versatility."
