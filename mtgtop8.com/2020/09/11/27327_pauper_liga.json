By using cards like Counterspell, Snuff Out, and Faerie Seer, the player can disrupt their opponent's plans and maintain board advantage. The deck also includes creatures like Ninja of the Deep Hours and Spellstutter Sprite to provide additional pressure while also drawing more cards. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Gurmag Angler and Thorn of the Black Rose ensure that the player can close out the game once they have solidified their control."
