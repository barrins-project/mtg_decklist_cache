By utilizing cards like Embercleave and Domri's Ambush, the deck aims to deal large amounts of damage quickly and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Robber of the Rich and Questing Beast provide additional value and disruption. Overall, the deck aims to maintain a fast-paced tempo and seize control of the game early on."
