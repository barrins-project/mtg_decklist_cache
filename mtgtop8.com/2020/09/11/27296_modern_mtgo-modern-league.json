The deck aims to control the game by sacrificing lands and creatures with Smallpox and utilizing Liliana of the Veil's abilities to grind out value. The addition of Ensnaring Bridge helps stall the opponent's attacks, while Cling to Dust provides card advantage. Ultimately, the deck seeks to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
