Karn, the Great Creator offers access to utility artifacts, while Mishra's Factory and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth provide additional threats and mana fixing. The deck is designed to grind out incremental advantage and outlast the opponent through attrition."

By continuously replaying these creatures for free with Aluren, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with card advantage and board presence. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Abrupt Decay to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan. This deck focuses on efficient card selection and resource management to achieve a fast and consistent win condition."
