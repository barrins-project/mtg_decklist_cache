The inclusion of Hardened Scales and Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit provides additional synergy with +1/+1 counters, making the combo even more powerful. Overall, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and quickly close out the game with its powerful combo."

By using cards like Umbral Mantle and Devoted Druid, along with Marwyn, the Nurturer and Elvish Archdruid, the deck aims to produce large amounts of mana to activate powerful abilities like Ezuri, Renegade Leader's overrun effect. Additionally, cards like Leyline of Abundance and Chord of Calling help to further support the combo strategy by providing additional mana and searching for key pieces of the combo."
