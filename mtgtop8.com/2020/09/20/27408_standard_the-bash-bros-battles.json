By utilizing powerful creatures like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Brazen Borrower, along with recursive spells like Bala Ged Recovery, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent in the late game. The inclusion of Shark Typhoon provides a win condition that can also be used defensively. Additionally, the deck benefits from a strong mana base that allows for consistent access to all three colors."
