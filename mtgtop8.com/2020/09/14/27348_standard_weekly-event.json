The deck focuses on dealing damage quickly and efficiently, utilizing cards like Embercleave, Anax, and Torbran to increase the power of creatures and burn the opponent's life total down. With a low curve and plenty of burn spells, this deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize or mount a significant defense."
