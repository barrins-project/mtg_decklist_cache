By using cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns, Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and Gilded Goose, the deck can quickly generate advantage and maintain control of the game. The inclusion of disruptive cards like Force of Will and Abrupt Decay help protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a mix of card draw, removal, and powerful creatures, this deck can quickly snowball out of control and secure victory."

The key strategy is to deploy small evasive creatures like Changeling Outcast and Ornithopter, then use Ninjas like Ingenious Infiltrator to bounce them back to hand and trigger their abilities. By blending aggression with card advantage, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents early while maintaining a steady stream of resources. The inclusion of counterspells and removal spells ensures that the deck can interact effectively with opposing strategies."

It also includes disruption cards like Force of Will and Stifle to protect the combo. The deck also has some flexibility with Oko, Thief of Crowns providing additional value and control options. The key strategy is to quickly get a big threat into play while disrupting opposing strategies, aiming to win the game before the opponent can establish a strong board presence."
