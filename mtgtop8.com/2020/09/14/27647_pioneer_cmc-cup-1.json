The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for the recycling of key creatures and spells from the graveyard. Stitcher's Supplier helps fuel graveyard synergies while Village Rites provides card advantage. The deck seeks to maintain board presence, disrupt the opponent's strategy with Thoughtseize, and close out the game quickly with efficient threats."
