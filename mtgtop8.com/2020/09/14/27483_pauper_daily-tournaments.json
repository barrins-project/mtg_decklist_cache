By efficiently managing resources and disrupting the opponent's game plan, the deck aims to maintain a tempo advantage and close out the game quickly. The deck also includes a mix of creature-based card advantage with Augur of Bolas and Thorn of the Black Rose, allowing for additional value and flexibility in different game situations."
