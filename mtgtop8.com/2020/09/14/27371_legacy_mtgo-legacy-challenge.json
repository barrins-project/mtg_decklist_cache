The deck focuses on using cards like Karn, the Great Creator, Narset, Parter of Veils, and Urza, Lord High Artificer to generate card advantage and disruption for the opponent. The deck also takes advantage of cards like Echo of Eons and Chalice of the Void to control the game and slow down the opponent's strategy. Additionally, cards like Lion's Eye Diamond and Lotus Petal provide the deck with mana acceleration to quickly deploy threats and overwhelm the opponent."
