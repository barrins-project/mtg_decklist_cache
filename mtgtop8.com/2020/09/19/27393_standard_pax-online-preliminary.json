The goal is to reach late game dominance by casting powerful spells like Genesis Ultimatum and Kenrith, the Returned King. The key concept revolves around using Omnath, Locus of Creation as a central piece to generate additional mana and card advantage, allowing for explosive plays and overwhelming the opponent with a combination of landfall triggers and big creatures."
