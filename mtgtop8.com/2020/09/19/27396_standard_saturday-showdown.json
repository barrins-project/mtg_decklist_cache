Taborax, Hope's Demise serves as a powerful finisher, growing larger with each sacrifice. Expedition Healer and Orah, Skyclave Hierophant provide additional support by gaining life and bringing back fallen creatures. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and incremental advantage."
