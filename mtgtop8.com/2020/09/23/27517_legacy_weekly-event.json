Utilizing cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns for additional disruption and tempo advantage, the deck seeks to maintain a strong board presence and limit the opponent's ability to execute their strategy effectively."

The deck aims to use mana acceleration cards like Chrome Mox and Lotus Petal to cast a high number of spells in a single turn, while also utilizing free creatures like Simian Spirit Guide and Elvish Spirit Guide to further enable the combo. The deck also includes disruption elements like Cabal Therapy to protect the combo from opponent's interaction."
