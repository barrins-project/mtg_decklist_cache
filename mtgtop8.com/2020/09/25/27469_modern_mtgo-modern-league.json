The key strategy revolves around leveraging the Human creature type synergies to rapidly grow and overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of powerful creatures. By using disruptive creatures like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter, alongside powerful anthem effects like Thalia's Lieutenant, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also presenting a fast clock. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for free instant-speed creature deployment, adding additional flexibility and unpredictability to the deck."
