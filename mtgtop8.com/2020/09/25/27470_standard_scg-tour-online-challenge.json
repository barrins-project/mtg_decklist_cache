By efficiently dealing with threats, disrupting the opponent's strategy, and generating card advantage through cards like Uro and Sea Gate Restoration, the deck aims to stabilize the board and eventually win through powerful late-game threats like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Shark Typhoon. The mana base is carefully crafted to ensure consistent access to all three colors of mana needed to cast the spells in the deck."
