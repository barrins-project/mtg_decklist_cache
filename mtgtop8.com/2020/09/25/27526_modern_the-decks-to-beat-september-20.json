The deck focuses on dealing damage quickly and efficiently, using cards like Blistercoil Weird, Monastery Swiftspear, and Soul-Scar Mage to continually pressure the opponent. By combining creatures with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Flame Slash, the deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion provides an additional source of damage and helps maintain the aggressive strategy of the deck."

            "notes": "The main concept of this Modern 1 vs 1 Control - UrzaTron deck is to efficiently assemble the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Tower, Urza's Mine, and Urza's Power Plant) to generate huge amounts of mana and play powerful threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Karn Liberated. The deck also includes various ways to search for and tutor these lands such as Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying, as well as utility cards like Blast Zone and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
