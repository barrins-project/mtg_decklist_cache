By utilizing low-cost creatures like Akoum Hellhound, Weaselback Redcap, and Goblin Arsonist, combined with burn spells like Shock and Spikefield Hazard, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early in the game. The inclusion of Obosh, the Preypiercer as a companion boosts the damage output of odd-costed cards, making it even more difficult for the opponent to stabilize. The goal is to maintain pressure and finish off the opponent before they can mount a defense."
