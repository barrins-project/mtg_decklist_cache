It also utilizes cards like Force of Will and Swords to Plowshares to maintain board control, while leveraging snow-covered lands and Arcum's Astrolabe for mana fixing. The inclusion of cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Ice-Fang Coatl provide additional value and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to outlast and outvalue opponents by disrupting their game plan and establishing its own dominant board presence."
