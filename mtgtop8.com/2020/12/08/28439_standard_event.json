The deck has a strong late-game potential with cards like Kiora Bests the Sea God and Ashiok, Nightmare Muse, ensuring that it can outvalue opponents in long, drawn-out games. Additionally, the mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's three-color requirements."

By using cards like Ruin Crab, Thieves' Guild Enforcer, and Drown in the Loch, the deck aims to slowly mill the opponent's library and disrupt their game plan. Cards like Lullmage's Domination and Into the Story can then capitalize on this strategy by taking control of key cards or drawing into more resources. The deck's combination of control elements and graveyard synergies make it a formidable force in a Standard 1 vs 1 format."
