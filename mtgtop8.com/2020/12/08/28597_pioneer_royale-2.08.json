By combining efficient burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock with powerful creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage, the deck aims to maintain a fast-paced and relentless assault. The addition of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion allows for recursion of key creatures or spells, providing additional consistency and staying power in longer games. This deck focuses on early aggression and efficient burn to secure victory."
