Overall, the key concept is to constantly disrupt the opponent's game plan while gradually building up a dominant position."

The deck aims to generate a lot of mana to cast powerful spells like Omnath, Locus of Creation and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, in order to overwhelm your opponent with threats and value. With a mix of ramp, control, and powerful finishers, this deck aims to outvalue and outlast your opponent in a longer game."
