            "notes": "The deck focuses on playing low-cost artifact creatures and using them to quickly empty your hand and overwhelm your opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and burn spells. By utilizing cards like Springleaf Drum and Prophetic Prism to help generate mana and draw cards, along with powerful threats like Myr Enforcer and Atog, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out games quickly. The inclusion of cards like Fling and Galvanic Blast provide additional reach and ways to finish off opponents before they have a chance to stabilize."
