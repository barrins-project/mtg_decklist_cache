By combining aggressive creatures like Nighthawk Scavenger and Luminarch Aspirant with Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose's ability to deal damage based on lifegain, the deck can deal large bursts of damage quickly. It also includes cards like Malakir Rebirth and Village Rites for card advantage and resilience. The use of Orzhov colors allows for a strong mix of creature aggression and lifegain synergy."
