The deck also includes some removal spells like Oblivion Ring and Journey to Nowhere to deal with threats from the opponent. Lead the Stampede helps refill your hand with creatures to keep up the pressure. The mana base is built with a mix of Forests and Plains, along with some Blossoming Sands for additional lifegain. This deck aims to win quickly by attacking relentlessly with a strong board presence."
