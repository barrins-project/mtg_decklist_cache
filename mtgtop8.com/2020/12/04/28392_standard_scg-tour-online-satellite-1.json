The deck aims to establish board presence early on with cards like Brushfire Elemental and Kazandu Mammoth, and then close out the game with big threats like Questing Beast and Lovestruck Beast. The Great Henge provides additional card draw and ramp, while Bonecrusher Giant offers removal and reach. Shatterskull Smashing acts as versatile removal or a finisher. Overall, the deck is focused on fast, proactive plays to apply pressure and win the game quickly."
