The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den allows for additional recursion and resilience, making it a formidable combo deck in the Modern format."

Primeval Titan can also be used to search for Valakut and additional Mountains, creating a powerful combo that can deal lethal damage in one turn. The key strategy is to assemble the combo pieces efficiently and quickly to overwhelm the opponent."
