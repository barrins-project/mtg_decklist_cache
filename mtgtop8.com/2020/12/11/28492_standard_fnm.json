By constantly milling cards from the opponent's library with cards like Ruin Crab and Merfolk Windrobber, it aims to deck out the opponent and win through card advantage. Thieves' Guild Enforcer and Soaring Thought-Thief help to speed up the milling process, while cards like Drown in the Loch and Lullmage's Domination provide control elements to handle threats. The inclusion of Lurrus of the Dream-Den as companion adds additional value by recurring small creatures and spells from the graveyard."
