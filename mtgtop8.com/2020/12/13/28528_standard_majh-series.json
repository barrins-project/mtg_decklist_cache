The inclusion of cards like Brushfire Elemental and Kazandu Mammoth helps to provide consistent damage output, while cards like The Great Henge provide extra value and card advantage."

The deck focuses on utilizing creatures like Questing Beast, Lovestruck Beast, and Brushfire Elemental to deal damage efficiently while also maintaining card advantage with Edgewall Innkeeper. Additionally, the deck includes removal spells like Bonecrusher Giant and Shatterskull Smashing to deal with threats from the opponent. The key strategy is to establish a board presence early on and use cards like Embercleave and The Great Henge to finish off the opponent quickly."
