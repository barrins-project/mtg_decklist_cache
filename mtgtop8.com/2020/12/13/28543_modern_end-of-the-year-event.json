By utilizing a combination of direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Lava Spike, along with hasty creatures such as Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a strong defense. The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze adds additional pressure and disruption to further push for a quick victory."
