            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively play spells that allow you to quickly get Arclight Phoenix into play, utilizing cards like Buried Alive and Dreadhorde Arcanist to bring back Phoenix from the graveyard. The deck focuses on disrupting your opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Opposition Agent while also maintaining control with counter spells like Force of Will and Daze. By efficiently cycling through your deck with cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder, you aim to overwhelm your opponent and close out the game quickly with aggressive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Arclight Phoenix."
