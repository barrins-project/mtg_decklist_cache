This mana is then used to cast powerful colorless threats such as Karn Liberated, Karn, the Great Creator, and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to control the game. The deck also includes ways to find the UrzaTron lands (Expedition Map, Ancient Stirrings, Sylvan Scrying) and various removal and disruption spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win conditions."
