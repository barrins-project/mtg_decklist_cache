Cards like Bomat Courier, Dreadhorde Arcanist, and Kroxa, Titan of Death's Hunger provide consistent threats, while Spell-based cards like Young Pyromancer and Village Rites help generate value. Thoughtseize and Duress disrupt opponents' game plans, while Claim the Firstborn and Claim / Fame offer additional utility. The deck is efficient in putting pressure on opponents and disrupting their strategies, making it a strong contender in Pioneer 1 vs 1 matches."
