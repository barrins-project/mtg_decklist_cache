The inclusion of Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion allows for additional value by flickering permanents. The deck also includes a mix of counterspells and disruption to control the flow of the game."

The deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent through aggressive creatures and combat tricks, with cards like Embercleave and Maul of the Skyclaves serving as finishers. Elspeth, Sun's Nemesis provides additional resilience and card advantage, while Ox of Agonas helps refill the hand in case of running out of resources. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistent performance and tempo advantage."
