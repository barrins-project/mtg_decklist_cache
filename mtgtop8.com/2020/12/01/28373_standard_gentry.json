It focuses on generating card advantage through card draw and creating tokens while countering threats with counterspells. The creatures in the deck provide additional card draw and disruption, while the mana base allows for flexibility between red and blue spells. Overall, the strategy is to outvalue your opponent and maintain control of the game until you can close it out with powerful finishers like The Royal Scions or Jace, Mirror Mage."
