The inclusion of Spellstutter Sprite provides additional disruption against cheap spells, while Faerie Seer helps set up the top of the deck. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements with a mix of Islands, Swamps, and color-fixing lands."

It gains life with cards like Kabira Crossroads and Lone Missionary, and can generate card advantage with Palace Sentinels and Thraben Inspector. The deck also utilizes recursion with Omen of the Dead and Reaping the Graves. It aims to outvalue the opponent by generating card advantage and maintaining board control until it can win the game through attrition."
