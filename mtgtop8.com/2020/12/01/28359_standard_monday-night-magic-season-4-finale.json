By utilizing cards like Ruin Crab, Drown in the Loch, and Thieves' Guild Enforcer, the deck aims to mill the opponent's deck and deny them resources while protecting its own board with counter spells and creature removal. The goal is to outvalue the opponent by creating card advantage through Into the Story and by leveraging the synergy between the creatures and spells in the deck."
