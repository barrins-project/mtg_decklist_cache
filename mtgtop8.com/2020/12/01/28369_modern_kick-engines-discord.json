The deck focuses on using red mana sources to cast powerful spells like Boros Charm, Searing Blaze, and Lava Spike to deal direct damage to the opponent. With a mix of creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear to apply pressure early on, while cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish opponents for casting spells. Atarka's Command provides versatility in boosting damage output or disrupting the opponent's strategy."

It focuses on milling cards from the library to get key pieces into the graveyard, like Vengevine and Sword of the Meek, then uses graveyard recursion and mana acceleration cards to bring them back and create a powerful board presence quickly. It also includes some protection elements like Leyline of Sanctity to counter opposing strategies. Overall, it aims to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and relentless combo assault."
