The deck aims to gain card advantage and ramp up its mana to eventually overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats such as Mulldrifter and Ulamog's Crusher. By controlling the board and resource management, the deck aims to outlast and outvalue the opponent in a grindy game. The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's plans while steadily building towards a win condition."

The inclusion of cards like Thraben Inspector and Thoughtcast provide card advantage, while Atog acts as a finisher by sacrificing artifacts for lethal damage. This deck aims to be fast-paced and relentless in its aggression."

It combines card advantage with removal and counterspells to disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up its own win condition. The key strategy is to assemble the Urzatron as quickly as possible, generate card advantage with Mulldrifter and Mnemonic Wall, and lock down the opponent with control spells like Stonehorn Dignitary and Dinrova Horror. The deck can also win through burn damage with Kaervek's Torch if needed."
