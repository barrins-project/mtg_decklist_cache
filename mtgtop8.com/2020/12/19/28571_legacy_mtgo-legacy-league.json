Cabal Therapy is used to disrupt opponents' strategies while Careful Study and Once Upon a Time provide card selection and dig for combo pieces. Bridge from Below is a key enabler for creating token creatures, with support from Hedron Crab and Stitcher's Supplier to mill the deck and fuel graveyard synergies. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with explosive graveyard interactions and combo potential."
