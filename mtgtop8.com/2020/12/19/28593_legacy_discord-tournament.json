Additionally, cards like Glimpse of Nature and Heritage Druid help to draw through the deck and flood the board with Elves, creating overwhelming board presence and potential for a lethal combo finish with Craterhoof Behemoth. The deck is centered around fast mana generation and creature synergy to overwhelm opponents quickly."
