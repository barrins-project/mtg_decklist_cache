By using cards like Claim the Firstborn and Whisper Squad, the deck can steal and sacrifice creatures from the opponent to trigger effects like Bastion of Remembrance and Village Rites. With a mix of low-cost creatures and sacrifice outlets, the deck aims to maintain board presence while steadily chipping away at the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Anax, Hardened in the Forge and Durable Coilbug provide resilience and additional threats to pressure the opponent."
