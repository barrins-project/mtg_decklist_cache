The key strategy is to generate value by blinking permanents with Yorion, Sky Nomad, triggering powerful enter-the-battlefield abilities multiple times. The deck also utilizes a mix of enchantments and planeswalkers to further control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a focus on incremental advantage and resource denial, the deck seeks to outvalue the opponent and eventually overwhelm them with superior board presence."
