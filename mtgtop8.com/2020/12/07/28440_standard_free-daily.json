The deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total with a combination of direct damage spells like Slaying Fire and Roil Eruption, while also utilizing cards like Roiling Vortex to disrupt opposing strategies. The land base is designed to support the aggressive playstyle, with Castle Embereth and Crawling Barrens providing additional utility."
