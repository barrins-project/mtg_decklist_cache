It combines cards like Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek to generate a steady stream of tokens, while Urza, Lord High Artificer provides ramp and card advantage. Emry, Lurker of the Loch helps recur important artifacts from the graveyard, and cards like Engineered Explosives and Metallic Rebuke provide disruption and removal. The deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent with efficient artifact synergies."
