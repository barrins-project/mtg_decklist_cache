This archetype heavily leans into control elements, with cards like Dinrova Horror and Stonehorn Dignitary to disrupt the opponent's game plan. It also includes card advantage engines like Mulldrifter and Mnemonic Wall to maintain a strong hand. The deck aims to stall the game with Moment's Peace and Weather the Storm until it can assemble its powerful win conditions like Rolling Thunder or Reaping the Graves."
