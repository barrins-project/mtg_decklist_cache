The deck aims to protect its creatures from removal while dealing consistent damage to the opponent, making it a fast and aggressive strategy that can overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to respond. By utilizing a combination of auras and hexproof creatures, this deck aims to create an unstoppable offensive force."
