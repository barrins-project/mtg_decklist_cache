The deck aims to generate card advantage with Narset, Parter of Veils and Hullbreacher, while also using Teferi, Time Raveler to disrupt the opponent's game plan. By using efficient removal like Swords to Plowshares and Supreme Verdict, along with powerful control elements like Force of Will and Counterspell, this deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent until it can win the game through powerful finishers like Shark Typhoon."
