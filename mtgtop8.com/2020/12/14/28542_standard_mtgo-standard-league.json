The deck also includes powerful equipment like Embercleave to give creatures additional damage and abilities, as well as ramp spells like Kazandu Mammoth and The Great Henge to ensure a steady flow of threats. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a barrage of fast, high-impact creatures."
