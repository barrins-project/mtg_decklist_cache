The graveyard recursion ability of cards like Sword of the Meek and Creeping Chill combined with the combo pieces allows for explosive plays. The deck aims to win quickly without relying on traditional land cards, utilizing a combination of creature-based combos and powerful spells. The inclusion of protection and card draw spells like Pact of Negation and Turntimber Symbiosis help ensure the combo can be executed effectively."
