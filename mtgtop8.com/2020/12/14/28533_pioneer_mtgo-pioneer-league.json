By utilizing cards like Alseid of Life's Bounty, Sram, Senior Edificer, and Ethereal Armor, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with large, evasive threats early on. The key is to combine cheap creatures with powerful auras, protecting them when necessary with cards like Karametra's Blessing and Cartouche of Solidarity. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure from the start and maintain a strong board presence to quickly close out the game."
