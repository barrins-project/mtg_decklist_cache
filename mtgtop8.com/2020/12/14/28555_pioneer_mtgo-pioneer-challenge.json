The key strategy is to quickly build up individual creatures with auras like All That Glitters and Ethereal Armor, while protecting them with cards like Alseid of Life's Bounty. By using Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion, players can continuously return auras from the graveyard to the battlefield, ensuring a steady flow of enhancements to overwhelm opponents. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful, buffed-up creatures early on."
