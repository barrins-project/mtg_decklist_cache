With Yorion as a companion, the deck focuses on generating value from permanents with flicker effects while maintaining board control with cards like Elder Gargaroth and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The deck also includes a mix of graveyard hate, ramp, and card draw to adapt to different matchups and ensure a steady stream of threats and answers. Ultimately, the goal is to grind out opponents and overwhelm them with powerful threats and resilient card advantage engines."
