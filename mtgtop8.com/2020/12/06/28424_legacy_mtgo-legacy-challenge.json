The deck aims to tutor key combo pieces such as Craterhoof Behemoth and Allosaurus Shepherd using Green Sun's Zenith and Natural Order to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a massive army of elves and win the game in a single turn. The deck also utilizes creatures with untap abilities like Quirion Ranger and Wirewood Symbiote to further generate mana and keep the combo going."

With mana acceleration from lands like Cloudpost and Eldrazi Temple, this deck can quickly establish a dominant board presence and close out games efficiently. The inclusion of utility cards like Karn, the Great Creator and Ugin, the Ineffable adds versatility and resilience to the strategy."

The goal is to build a large board presence of Elves and then use Natural Order to search for Craterhoof Behemoth to deliver a massive, game-winning attack. The deck also includes protection and utility cards like Allosaurus Shepherd and Wirewood Symbiote to help the combo go off smoothly. With the right sequence of plays, this deck can overwhelm opponents with its powerful synergy and efficient mana generation."

The deck aims to maintain tempo advantage through cards like Daze and Wasteland, while also providing card selection and manipulation through Brainstorm, Preordain, and Ponder. Oko, Thief of Crowns provides additional disruption and versatility, making it difficult for opponents to stabilize or mount an effective defense. Overall, the deck seeks to quickly pressure opponents and disrupt their game plan to secure a victory."
