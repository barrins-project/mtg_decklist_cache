By utilizing cards like Blood Moon, Pillage, Magus of the Moon, and Utopia Sprawl, the deck aims to slow down the opponent and control the board while also generating value through powerful creatures like Elder Gargaroth, Bonecrusher Giant, and Glorybringer. The deck's strategy revolves around using its disruptive elements to control the game and create opportunities for its powerful creatures to take over and secure victory."
