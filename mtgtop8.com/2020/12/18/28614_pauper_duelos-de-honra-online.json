By utilizing cards like Thraben Inspector and Ardent Recruit to generate card advantage, as well as powerful threats like Myr Enforcer and Atog, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and finish the game with burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Fling. The mana base is also designed to support the deck's affinity mechanic, allowing for easy casting of spells while maintaining board presence."
