The main strategy is to continuously pressure the opponent's life total with cards like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Price of Progress, while also utilizing creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear to further apply pressure. Sulfuric Vortex helps prevent opponents from gaining life, while Fireblast can provide a burst of damage to finish off the opponent. Overall, this deck focuses on quickly reducing the opponent's life total before they can stabilize."

The deck includes disruption and card selection spells like Thoughtseize, Force of Will, and Brainstorm to protect the combo and find the necessary pieces. It also includes mana acceleration with Lotus Petal and Ancient Tomb to help execute the combo efficiently. The deck aims to win the game quickly and decisively through this combo strategy."
