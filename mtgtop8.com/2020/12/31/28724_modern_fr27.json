Using cards like Blood Sun and Cleansing Wildfire, the deck can also disrupt the opponent's mana base. The deck also includes a win condition in Shark Typhoon, providing a versatile threat that can close out the game. The deck's mana base is carefully constructed to support its control elements."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and stall until it can assemble its combo to win the game in one big turn. The deck also includes powerful threats like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Brazen Borrower to provide additional pressure and value."
