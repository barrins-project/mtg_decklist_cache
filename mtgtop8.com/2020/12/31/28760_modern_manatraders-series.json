The inclusion of counterspells like Cryptic Command, Mana Leak, and Force of Negation allows for disruption and protection. The deck also utilizes land synergy with Field of the Dead and Mystic Sanctuary to generate additional threats and recur powerful spells. The mana base is finely tuned to support the deck's color requirements and maximize consistency."

The goal is to mill through the deck, bringing back key creatures and dealing incremental damage to the opponent. The deck is designed to be fast and aggressive, leveraging the graveyard as a resource to overwhelm the opponent. It aims to set up a powerful board state and put pressure on the opponent quickly, before they have a chance to stabilize."
