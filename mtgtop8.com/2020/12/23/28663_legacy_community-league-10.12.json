By casting Aluren, players can cast Cavern Harpy infinitely to bounce and recast creatures such as Leovold, Emissary of Trest and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath. This allows for consistent card draw and value generation, with the option to disrupt opponents with cards like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Force of Will. The deck aims to control the game through a combination of creature value and disruption, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with its powerful synergy."

The deck aims to bring back creatures like Ichorid and Narcomoeba from the graveyard by dredging Golgari Grave-Troll and Golgari Thug, generating zombie tokens with Bridge from Below. Cabal Therapy is used for disruption and protection, while Breakthrough helps to fill the graveyard even faster. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures and win through a combination of aggression and graveyard shenanigans."
