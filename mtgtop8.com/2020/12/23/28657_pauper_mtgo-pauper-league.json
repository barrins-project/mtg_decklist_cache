            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to maintain control of the game through countering opponent's spells, removal, and card draw. Using efficient cards like Spellstutter Sprite and Faerie Duelist, along with card selection from Ponder and Preordain, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while generating card advantage. The inclusion of Skred and Fiery Cannonade provide removal options against creature-heavy decks, while the inclusion of Ninja of the Deep Hours allows for additional card draw. Overall, the deck looks to outvalue the opponent and win through attrition."

By using cards like Thermokarst, Mwonvuli Acid-Moss, and Stone Rain, you can slow down your opponent's game plan while generating card advantage with Mulldrifter and Bonder's Ornament. Annoyed Altisaur and Boarding Party provide threats on the board, while Arbor Elf helps with mana acceleration. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain control throughout the game."

Utilizing a mix of cheap interaction and powerful finishers, the deck seeks to overwhelm opponents before they can stabilize or mount a successful defense."
