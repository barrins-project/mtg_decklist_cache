The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Oko, Thief of Crowns and Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath to generate value and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a solid mana base and a mix of countermagic and burn spells, this deck aims to maintain board presence and tempo advantage to outmaneuver opponents and secure victories in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
