This allows the player to cast big threats like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The deck also utilizes cards like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to search for specific lands, ensuring consistency in assembling the Tron lands. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats and control the game with efficient removal and disruption."

The deck includes a mix of removal spells and utility creatures like Goblin Cratermaker to control the board.

By using rituals and other mana ramp spells, the deck can quickly assemble the necessary resources to either cast a large Reforge the Soul, activate Goblin Charbelcher for lethal damage, or find key pieces with Irencrag Feat and Recross the Paths. Additionally, disruption and protection are provided through Pact of Negation and Spikefield Hazard to ensure the combo can go off smoothly."
