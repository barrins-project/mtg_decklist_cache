By using cards like Ruin Crab and Thieves' Guild Enforcer to mill the opponent's deck, and counterspells like Drown in the Loch and Essence Scatter to stop key plays, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and eventually win the game through card advantage and controlling the board. Additionally, using Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion adds extra resiliency and utility to the deck."
