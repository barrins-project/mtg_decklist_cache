The deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent, utilizing efficient creatures with abilities like haste and evasion to quickly chip away at the opponent's life total. The inclusion of removal spells like Bonecrusher Giant and Skyclave Apparition helps to clear the way for the deck's creatures to deal damage directly to the opponent. Overall, the deck focuses on a fast, aggressive game plan to secure victory."
