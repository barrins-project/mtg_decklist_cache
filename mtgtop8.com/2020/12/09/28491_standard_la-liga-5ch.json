The key strategy involves using Yorion, Sky Nomad as a companion to take advantage of its blinking ability to repeatedly exile and return key cards like Skyclave Apparition and Dream Trawler for continuous value. The deck also includes cards like Giant Killer and Elspeth Conquers Death to handle threats efficiently. The goal is to outlast the opponent and eventually establish a dominant board presence with cards like Emeria's Call and Shark Typhoon."
