            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to control the game by using a mix of removal spells, ramping cards, and powerful creatures. The deck aims to stabilize the board with cards like Bonecrusher Giant and Brazen Borrower while ramping up its mana with Cultivate and Genesis Ultimatum in order to cast big threats like Terror of the Peaks and Obosh, the Preypiercer. The Great Henge provides card draw and additional mana, while cards like Edgewall Innkeeper provide card advantage. The deck's goal is to outvalue the opponent and overwhelm them with its powerful threats."
