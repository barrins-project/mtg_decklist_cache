The deck also includes Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion for additional value. By controlling the game through disruption and milling, this deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."

It utilizes high-powered creatures like Torbran, Thane of Red Fell and Embercleave to deal massive amounts of damage, while also including cards like Robber of the Rich and Bonecrusher Giant to maintain board control. With a low mana curve and a high density of threats, the deck aims to apply pressure early and force the opponent to react defensively, ultimately leading to victory through sheer aggression."
