With cards like The Great Henge and Genesis Ultimatum, the deck can generate immense value and overwhelm the opponent. Utilizing a mix of removal spells and high-impact creatures like Terror of the Peaks, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Elder Gargaroth, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building up its own board presence. The mana ramp provided by Lotus Cobra, Llanowar Visionary, and Cultivate helps the deck play its high-cost spells quickly and efficiently."
