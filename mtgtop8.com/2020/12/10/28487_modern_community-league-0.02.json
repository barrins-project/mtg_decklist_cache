Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Leonin Arbiter slow down the opponent's spells and land fetching abilities, while Stoneforge Mystic fetches powerful equipment such as Sword of Fire and Ice and Batterskull to provide additional pressure. Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment and Ethersworn Canonist limits the opponent's ability to cast multiple spells in a turn. The deck aims to control the game tempo and overwhelm the opponent with a mix of disruption and aggression."
