It also incorporates snow permanents for synergies with cards like Dead of Winter and Ice-Fang Coatl. The mana base is designed to support casting spells of multiple colors efficiently. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, generate card advantage, and eventually win through incremental advantage and powerful threats."
