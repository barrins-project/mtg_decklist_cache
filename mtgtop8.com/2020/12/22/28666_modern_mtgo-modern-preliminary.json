It utilizes counterspells like Force of Negation and Cryptic Command to control the board, removal spells like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay to deal with threats, and recursive card advantage engines like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Life from the Loam to outvalue the opponent in the long game. Additionally, it aims to ramp up its mana with Wilderness Reclamation and Growth Spiral to enable powerful plays and eventually win the game through attrition or overwhelming the opponent with Field of the Dead tokens."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating value through card advantage and efficient mana ramp. The deck utilizes a variety of lands to help fix mana and provide additional utility, while also leveraging powerful cards like Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath and Omnath, Locus of Creation to generate incremental advantage and close out the game. Ultimately, the deck seeks to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent in a longer game."
