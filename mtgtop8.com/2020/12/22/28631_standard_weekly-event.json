The deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on with cards like Gilded Goose and Lovestruck Beast, and then ramp up to larger threats like Feasting Troll King and Kogla, the Titan Ape. The deck also focuses on generating value through cards like Trail of Crumbs and The Great Henge to maintain momentum and outpace the opponent. Additionally, the inclusion of Crawling Barrens provides a late-game win condition if needed."
