By controlling the board and generating card advantage through cards like Preordain and Mulldrifter, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and eventually win the game through attrition. The inclusion of counterspells like Counterspell and Prohibit, along with bounce spells like Snap, provides the necessary interaction to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
