The goal is to outvalue the opponent by controlling the board state and eventually winning with powerful late-game threats like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while steadily advancing its own game plan towards victory."

By utilizing cards like Brazen Borrower and Bonecrusher Giant for removal, along with cards like Edgewall Innkeeper and Lovestruck Beast for card advantage, the deck aims to establish board presence and outvalue the opponent. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Terror of the Peaks and Genesis Ultimatum can quickly close out the game if left unchecked. The mana base is carefully crafted to ensure consistent mana production for the deck's powerful spells and creatures."
