The overall strategy is to apply constant pressure, utilizing powerful creatures like Questing Beast and Embercleave to quickly finish off the opponent. The inclusion of removal spells like Scorching Dragonfire and Shatterskull Smashing helps to maintain board control and clear the way for your creatures to attack. Vivien, Monsters' Advocate provides additional card advantage and allows for the generation of more threats."
