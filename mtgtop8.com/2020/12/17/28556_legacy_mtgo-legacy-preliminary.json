The goal is to cast powerful creatures like Craterhoof Behemoth and Allosaurus Shepherd for a game-ending attack. Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith help to cycle through the deck and find the necessary combo pieces. Natural Order provides a way to tutor for key cards, while Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger offer utility and protection for the Elves. The deck is focused on explosive plays and overwhelming the opponent with a massive board presence."
