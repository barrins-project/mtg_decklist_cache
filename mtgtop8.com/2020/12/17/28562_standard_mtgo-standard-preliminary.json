            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly build up a board of powerful creatures and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays. By utilizing mana ramping cards like Gilded Goose and Lovestruck Beast, as well as strong creatures like Feasting Troll King and Wicked Wolf, the deck can apply pressure early and maintain a threatening board presence. Support cards like The Great Henge and Trail of Crumbs provide additional benefits and card advantage to keep the deck going strong. The deck aims to establish dominance on the battlefield and quickly close out games."
