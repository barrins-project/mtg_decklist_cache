The deck aims to rapidly ramp up mana using cards like Seething Song, Simian Spirit Guide, Lotus Petal, and mana lands like Ancient Tomb and City of Traitors to get these creatures in play as quickly as possible. Trinisphere helps disrupt opponent's game plan, while Polluted Delta and Scalding Tarn provide additional deck thinning and fixing."
