By constantly cycling cards like Startling Development and Zenith Flare, the deck aims to amass a large number of cycling triggers to deal massive amounts of damage. Additionally, cards like Drannith Stinger and Flourishing Fox provide additional sources of damage while Yidaro, Wandering Monster can be cycled to provide a powerful finisher. The deck also includes a mix of lands and spells to provide additional utility and versatility in different situations."
