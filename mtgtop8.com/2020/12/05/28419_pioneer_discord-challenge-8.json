Utilizing cards like Ethereal Armor and All That Glitters, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful, enchanted creatures. This deck also includes Lurrus of the Dream-Den as a companion to provide additional value and recursion for auras and creatures. The mana base is optimized for consistency and includes cards like Concealed Courtyard and Fabled Passage."
