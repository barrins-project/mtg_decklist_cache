By discarding cards and sacrificing creatures, the player can trigger powerful effects such as bringing back creatures with Dread Return and generating zombie tokens with Bridge from Below. This combo-based strategy aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats and disrupt their game plan through cards like Cabal Therapy. The deck's mana base is designed to support the explosive graveyard interactions."

Bitterblossom provides a steady stream of Faerie tokens, while Hullbreacher and Nighthawk Scavenger offer additional disruption and threats. Drown in the Loch and Cling to Dust provide removal and disruption, while the mana base is designed to support the deck's control elements with access to different colors and utility lands. The deck aims to out-value and outlast the opponent through a combination of disruption and evasive threats."
