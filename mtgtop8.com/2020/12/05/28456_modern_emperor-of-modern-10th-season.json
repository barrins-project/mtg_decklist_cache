The deck also includes elements of direct damage with spells like Lightning Bolt and Temur Battle Rage to finish off opponents quickly. Lurrus of the Dream-Den provides additional value by allowing the player to recur low-cost creatures and spells from the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, disruptive, and aggressive."
