It also utilizes ramp cards like \"Seething Song\" and \"Simian Spirit Guide\" to accelerate mana production, while disruptive cards like \"Trinisphere\" can slow down the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to get massive threats like \"Emrakul, the Aeons Torn\" and \"Blightsteel Colossus\" onto the battlefield as quickly as possible, bypassing traditional summoning restrictions to win the game in a single turn."
