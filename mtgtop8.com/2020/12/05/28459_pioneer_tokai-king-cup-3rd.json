It focuses on controlling the board, disrupting the opponent's game plan, and eventually overwhelming them with value from cards like Niv-Mizzet Reborn, Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath, and Teferi, Time Raveler. The deck includes a mix of removal, counterspells, and card advantage tools to help navigate through various threats. The key strategy is to efficiently manage resources, establish a stable board state, and outvalue the opponent in the late game."
