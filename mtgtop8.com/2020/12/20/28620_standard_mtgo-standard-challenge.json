It utilizes cards like Ruin Crab, Soaring Thought-Thief, and Into the Story to mill the opponent's deck while controlling the board with counterspells and removal such as Drown in the Loch and Heartless Act. Lurrus of the Dream-Den acts as a companion that provides additional value by allowing you to recur lower-cost permanents. The deck aims to outlast opponents by controlling the pace of the game and depleting their resources through milling and removal."
