The deck has a strong emphasis on playing creatures to generate mana and draw cards, allowing for explosive plays and maintaining a steady stream of threats. By utilizing cards like Quirion Ranger and Axebane Guardian, the deck can quickly ramp up to play powerful creatures like Ulamog's Crusher and Annoyed Altisaur. With a solid mana base and a mix of card draw and creature generation, this deck is designed to put pressure on the opponent and secure victory through aggression."
