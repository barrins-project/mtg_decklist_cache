The deck also focuses on mana acceleration with cards like Noble Hierarch and Green Sun's Zenith to ramp into powerful threats like Gaea's Cradle. Additionally, the deck has access to a toolbox of creatures to deal with different threats in the form of Knight of Autumn, Collector Ouphe, and Plague Engineer. The overall strategy is to control the board and outvalue the opponent using a combination of versatile creatures and disruptive spells."
