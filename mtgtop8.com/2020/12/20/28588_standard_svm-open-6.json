Key cards like Embercleave and The Great Henge provide power and card advantage, while creatures like Questing Beast and Bonecrusher Giant pack a punch. The deck also includes removal spells like Primal Might and The Akroan War to control the board. With a strong mana base and a mix of efficient creatures and powerful equipment, this deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence and close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
