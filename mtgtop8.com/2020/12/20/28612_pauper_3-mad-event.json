The deck also aims to apply pressure with efficient creatures like Phyrexian Rager and Chittering Rats, while gaining card advantage with Sign in Blood. The deck's finishers include Gray Merchant of Asphodel for draining the opponent's life total and Cuombajj Witches for additional board control. The deck's strategy is to apply pressure early, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and close out the game with a combination of creatures and removal spells."
