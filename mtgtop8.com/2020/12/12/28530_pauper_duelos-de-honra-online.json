The deck also includes win conditions like Goblin Wizardry and Skred to close out the game once it has complete control."

With a mix of early game threats like Young Wolf and Llanowar Elves, mid-game creatures like Bone Picker and Nest Invader, and late-game finishers like Hooting Mandrills, the deck aims to pressure the opponent while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Chainer's Edict and Cast Down. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Bequeathal and Reaping the Graves to maximize value from its creatures entering and leaving the battlefield."
