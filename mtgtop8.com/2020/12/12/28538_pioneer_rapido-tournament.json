Once Lotus Field is in play, the deck aims to generate a large amount of mana through various untap effects such as Hidden Strings and Vizier of Tumbling Sands. This excess mana can then be used to cast powerful spells like Peer into the Abyss or Dig Through Time to close out the game. The deck has built-in resilience with cards like Bala Ged Recovery and strategic planning to ensure its combo pieces remain intact."
