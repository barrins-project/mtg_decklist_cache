The inclusion of cards like The Great Henge and Scavenging Ooze also provide additional value and resilience to maintain pressure on the opponent. The mana base is carefully constructed with a mix of dual lands and fetch lands to ensure consistent mana production, allowing for smooth gameplay and efficient deployment of threats."
