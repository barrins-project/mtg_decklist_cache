The deck also includes additional combo pieces like Griselbrand and Laboratory Maniac for alternate win conditions. The inclusion of Chancellor of the Tangle helps to accelerate the combo by providing additional mana sources."

The key strategy is to lower your own life total to boost the power of Death's Shadow and Scourge of the Skyclaves, while also disrupting your opponent's game plan with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek. Lurrus of the Dream-Den serves as a companion, providing additional value by allowing you to recast low-cost creatures from your graveyard."
