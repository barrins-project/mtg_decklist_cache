The deck utilizes mana acceleration from cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Eldrazi Temple to power out its threats quickly, while also including utility lands like Karakas and Mishra's Factory for additional value. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful Eldrazi threats and disrupt their game plan to secure a quick victory."
