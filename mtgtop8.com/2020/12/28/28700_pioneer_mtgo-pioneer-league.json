Wilderness Reclamation allows for explosive turns with additional mana, while Shark Typhoon provides a threat that can close out games or provide blockers when needed. Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath provides card advantage and life gain, making it a versatile threat. The deck also includes a few key lands for additional card advantage and utility."
