The deck also includes cards like Surgical Extraction and Mission Briefing to disrupt the opponent's strategy and remove key cards from their graveyard. Additionally, it includes cards like Visions of Beyond, Ponder, and Brainstorm to draw additional cards and maintain a consistent stream of mill effects."

The deck aims to control the board with creatures like Knight of the Reliquary and Mother of Runes, while also applying pressure with efficient threats like Questing Beast and Tarmogoyf. The inclusion of disruptive creatures like Collector Ouphe and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben helps to disrupt the opponent's strategies, while cards like Swords to Plowshares and Abrupt Decay provide removal options to deal with opposing threats. The deck's strategy revolves around adapting to different matchups and making optimal plays based on the situation at hand."
