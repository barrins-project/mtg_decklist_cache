By utilizing cards like Chalice of the Void, Trinisphere, Smokestack, and Propaganda, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while gradually building up its own advantage through cards like Crucible of Worlds and Wasteland. The inclusion of cards like Mox Diamond and Ancient Tomb allow for faster mana development, while City of Traitors enables explosive plays. Ultimately, the deck aims to control the game and outvalue the opponent through resource denial and incremental advantage."
