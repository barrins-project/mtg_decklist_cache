            "notes": "This deck focuses on locking down the opponent's resources and preventing them from playing their spells effectively. By using a combination of artifacts like Chalice of the Void, Trinisphere, and Ensnaring Bridge, the deck creates a prison-like board state that hinders the opponent's ability to advance their game plan. The inclusion of cards like Karn, Silver Golem and Crucible of Worlds provides additional versatility and resilience to the strategy. With a suite of disruptive and controlling artifacts, this deck aims to control the game and grind out incremental advantage to ultimately secure victory."
