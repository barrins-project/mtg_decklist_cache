This allows the player to counter important spells and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes efficient removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and hand disruption with Thoughtseize. Additionally, there are creatures like Tarmogoyf and Trygon Predator to apply pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to maintain control of the game through counterspells, card advantage from Dark Confidant, and disruption spells while gradually closing out the game with its creatures."
