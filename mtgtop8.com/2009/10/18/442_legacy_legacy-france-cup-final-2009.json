            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game through the use of disruptive creatures like Spellstutter Sprite and Waterfront Bouncer, along with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze. With efficient card draw from Brainstorm and Dark Confidant, the deck aims to establish early board presence with Tarmogoyf and pressure opponents with Umezawa's Jitte. Resource denial is a key strategy with Wasteland, while Standstill provides card advantage and tempo advantage. The deck utilizes Aether Vial for creature deployment and efficient mana usage, ultimately aiming to out-value and outmaneuver opponents in a long game."
