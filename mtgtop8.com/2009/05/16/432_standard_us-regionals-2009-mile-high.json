The key strategy is to quickly build a board presence with cheap creatures like Goldmeadow Stalwart and Knight of Meadowgrain, then use anthem effects like Zealous Persecution and Ajani Goldmane to pump up the team and push for lethal damage. Windbrisk Heights allows for explosive plays with its hideaway ability, while Path to Exile provides removal for threatening enemy creatures. Overall, the deck focuses on speed and aggression to outpace and overpower the opponent."
