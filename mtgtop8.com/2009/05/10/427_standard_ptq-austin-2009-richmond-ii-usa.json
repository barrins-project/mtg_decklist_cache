It focuses on playing efficiently-costed creatures and using cards like Spectral Procession and Cloudgoat Ranger to generate multiple threats at once. The deck also utilizes powerful anthem effects from cards like Wilt-Leaf Liege and Ajani Goldmane to pump up the team and close out games. Additionally, it includes some cards for extra resilience and finishing power, such as Kitchen Finks and Overrun."

Sanity Grinding is a win-condition by milling the opponent's deck. Jace Beleren provides card advantage and control while Twincast allows for doubling up on key spells. Plumeveil and Overbeing of Myth offer defense against aggressive strategies. Shelldock Isle is used to hide powerful spells and reveal them at the right moment."
