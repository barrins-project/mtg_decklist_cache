By dredging these cards, you can bring back creatures like Narcomoeba and Ichorid for free and trigger abilities like Bridge from Below. This deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with fast creature recursion and combo off with cards like Dread Return to win the game before they have a chance to respond. Utilizing Lion's Eye Diamond for additional mana acceleration is also crucial for the combo to go off smoothly."
