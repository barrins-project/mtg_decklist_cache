The key strategy is to disrupt your opponent's game plan, control the board with creatures like Kitchen Finks and Wall of Denial, and generate card advantage with cards like Mulldrifter and Esper Charm. The deck also includes finishers like Bogardan Hellkite and Cruel Ultimatum to close out the game. By managing resources effectively and out-valuing the opponent, the deck aims to stay in control of the game from start to finish."
