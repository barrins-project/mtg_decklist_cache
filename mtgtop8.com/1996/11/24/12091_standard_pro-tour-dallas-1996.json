The deck achieves this through a combination of hand disruption spells like Hymn to Tourach, burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Incinerate, and efficient creatures like Hypnotic Specter and Black Knight. The deck also utilizes efficient mana acceleration with Dark Ritual and mana fixing with lands like Sulfurous Springs and City of Brass. Overall, the key concept is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while quickly closing out the game."
