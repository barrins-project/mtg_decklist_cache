The deck also utilizes disruption with cards like Swords to Plowshares and Disenchant to remove threats from the opponent's side of the battlefield. Additionally, the deck has access to powerful board wipes like Wrath of God and Armageddon to regain control of the game. The inclusion of Land Tax and Balance allows for card advantage and further disruption. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, aggressive creatures while maintaining control of the game state."

The deck utilizes powerful threats such as Erhnam Djinn, Sengir Vampire, and Hypnotic Specter, supported by efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireball. It also includes disruption elements like Hymn to Tourach and Hypnotic Specter to disrupt the opponent's hand and game plan. The deck further enhances its aggressive strategy with mana acceleration from Dark Ritual and efficient land choices like Mishra's Factory and Sulfurous Springs."

This is achieved through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw. The deck also aims to control the opponent's mana base with Land Tax and relies on powerful board wipes such as Wrath of God to reset the board. The inclusion of Icy Manipulator and Millstone allows for additional control and deck manipulation. Finally, Zuran Orb provides a means of gaining life and potentially sacrificing lands for additional benefits."
