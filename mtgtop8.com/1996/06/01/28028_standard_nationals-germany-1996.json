The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Disenchant and Swords to Plowshares, while also utilizing Icy Manipulator and Jayemdae Tome for additional control. The deck also includes ways to gain life and prevent damage with cards like Ivory Tower and Zuran Orb. The win condition of the deck is to control the board and overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures, such as Autumn Willow and Stormbind, or to burn them out with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireball."
