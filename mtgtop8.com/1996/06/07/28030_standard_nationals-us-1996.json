This allows you to control the game and limit your opponent's resources while slowly draining their life with cards like Ivory Tower and Zuran Orb. You also have access to lots of card draw and disruption with spells like Arcane Denial and Boomerang. The deck aims to create a grinding, control-based game plan that can ultimately lead to victory through attrition."
