By playing strong early creatures like Llanowar Elves and Wall of Roots, the deck can quickly build a board presence. Winter's Grasp and Wasteland provide disruption for the opponent while Stampeding Wildebeests and Spike Feeder provide additional threats. The deck also includes removal spells like Desert Twister and Creeping Mold to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the goal is to apply constant pressure on the opponent and maintain control of the battlefield."
