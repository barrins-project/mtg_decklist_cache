            "notes": "This deck focuses on maintaining control of the game by countering opponent's spells, while also generating energy to deal damage with Dynavolt Tower. It includes a mix of counterspells, removal, card draw, and finisher cards like Torrential Gearhulk. The goal is to control the board and outvalue the opponent's threats until you can establish a win condition with Dynavolt Tower or a big Gearhulk play. The main strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating enough resources to close out the game efficiently."
