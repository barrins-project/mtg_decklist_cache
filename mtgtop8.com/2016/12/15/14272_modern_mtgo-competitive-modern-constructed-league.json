Building up to a win condition through effective card draw, mana generation, and protection with cards like Pact of Negation is crucial to executing the combo successfully."

By utilizing cards like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while applying pressure on the board. The deck also includes various ways to control the game, such as Chalice of the Void and Dismember, in order to ensure that the Eldrazi creatures can attack without hindrance. Additionally, the deck includes ramp cards like Expedition Map and Eldrazi Temple to quickly bring out the bigger Eldrazi threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger."
