The deck also includes control elements with cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Harnessed Lightning, while providing additional value through cards like Whirler Virtuoso and Ishkanah, Grafwidow. Overall, the deck aims to quickly generate energy and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful creatures and versatile spells."
