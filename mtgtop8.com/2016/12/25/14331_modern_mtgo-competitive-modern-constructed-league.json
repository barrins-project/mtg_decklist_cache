Using cards like Cathartic Reunion and Faithless Looting to dig deeper into the deck and Life from the Loam to recycle lands, the deck aims to quickly assemble a board presence and overwhelm the opponent with a combo of recurring threats. Conflagrate and Scourge Devil provide additional reach and damage potential to close out the game."
