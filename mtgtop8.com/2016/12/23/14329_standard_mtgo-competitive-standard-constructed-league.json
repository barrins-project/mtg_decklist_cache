It includes cards like Servant of the Conduit and Whirler Virtuoso to generate extra energy and ramp into your big threats quickly. Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides additional value and removal, while Ishkanah, Grafwidow acts as a defensive option against aggressive strategies. The goal is to assemble the combo pieces and overwhelm your opponent with massive threats from the Marvelous Energy archetype."
