Using cheap artifacts and cards like Thoughtcast to draw more cards, it can overwhelm opponents with the presence of multiple threats and burn spells like Galvanic Blast. The deck also has a bit of card advantage and sacrifice synergy with cards like Ichor Wellspring and Perilous Research. With a mix of efficient creatures and spells, it aims to quickly push damage through and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
