Cards like Spell Queller and Reflector Mage provide tempo swings in your favor, while Gisela, the Broken Blade and Archangel Avacyn offer strong finishers. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides additional threats and ways to generate advantage. Overall, the deck aims to establish a board presence quickly and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
