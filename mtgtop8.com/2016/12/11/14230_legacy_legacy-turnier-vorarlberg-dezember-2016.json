Additionally, cards like Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top provide additional control and card selection."

By utilizing mana acceleration lands like Ancient Tomb and Eldrazi Temple, you can cast your large Eldrazi creatures ahead of schedule and overwhelm your opponent with their size and abilities. The deck also includes utility cards like Dismember and Warping Wail to deal with threats and protect your own creatures. Additionally, the inclusion of Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth helps to fix your mana base and ensure you have access to all your colors."

By utilizing cards like Counterbalance, Sensei's Divining Top, and Force of Will, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and protect its own win conditions. Monastery Mentor provides a threat that can quickly close out the game, while Terminus offers a powerful board wipe option. The inclusion of cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Snapcaster Mage add versatility and additional control elements to the deck's game plan."
