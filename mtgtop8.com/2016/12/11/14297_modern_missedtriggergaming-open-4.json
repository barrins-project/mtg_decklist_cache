The deck relies on synergy between its artifact creatures and cards like Steel Overseer and Arcbound Ravager to make them stronger. The inclusion of some protection with Etched Champion and removal with Shrapnel Blast adds versatility to the aggressive strategy. The manabase consists of lands that produce colorless mana and support the artifact theme of the deck."

The deck can win out of nowhere with its instant reanimation combos, putting immense pressure on opponents to find answers quickly. It aims to overwhelm opponents with huge threats and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize."

By combining aggressive creatures like Tarmogoyf, Siege Rhino, and Lingering Souls with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, the deck aims to apply early pressure while disrupting the opponent's key plays. The deck also includes removal spells like Path to Exile and Abrupt Decay to deal with threats on the board. With a mix of threats, disruption, and removal, this deck aims to outvalue and outpace the opponent in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."

The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel adds additional pressure on the opponent, making them choose between taking damage by playing spells. This deck aims to end the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize or gain life."
