The deck includes a variety of control cards such as Force of Will, Swords to Plowshares, and Counterspell to disrupt opponent's strategy. The goal is to control the board while setting up for powerful creatures like Monastery Mentor and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to finish off the opponent. The deck is designed to outlast the opponent and maintain board control until victory is achieved."
