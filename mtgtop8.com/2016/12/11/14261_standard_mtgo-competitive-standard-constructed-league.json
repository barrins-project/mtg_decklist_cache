It utilizes a combination of graveyard recursion, efficient removal, and powerful threats like Emrakul, the Promised End to grind out incremental advantages and out value the opponent. The deck aims to control the board, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and eventually overwhelm them with its powerful threats."
