By using cards like Thoughtseize, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Hymn to Tourach, the deck aims to strip the opponent's hand of important cards while also using cards like Sinkhole and Smallpox to disrupt their mana base. Cards like Liliana of the Veil and Nether Void help maintain control while dealing with threats, ultimately leading to victory through attrition."
