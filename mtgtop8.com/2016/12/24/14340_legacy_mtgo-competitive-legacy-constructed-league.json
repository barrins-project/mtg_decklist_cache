The main strategy is to play enchantments such as Argothian Enchantress and Enchantress's Presence, which trigger whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield, allowing the player to draw cards. This deck also uses cards like Solitary Confinement and Elephant Grass to protect itself while establishing its board presence. Additionally, the deck incorporates some control elements with cards like Suppression Field and Banishing Light, and has a win condition in Sigil of the Empty Throne, which creates angel tokens whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield."
