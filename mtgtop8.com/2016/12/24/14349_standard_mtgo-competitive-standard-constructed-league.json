By using cards like Grasp of Darkness, Ruinous Path, and Murder to deal with threats, as well as cards like Grim Flayer and Traverse the Ulvenwald to generate card advantage and find key cards, the deck aims to maintain board control and grind out a win through attrition. Additionally, the inclusion of powerful threats like Verdurous Gearhulk and Liliana, the Last Hope provides additional win conditions."
