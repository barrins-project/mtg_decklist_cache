By combining powerful cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, Smuggler's Copter, and Scrapheap Scrounger with efficient removal spells like Harnessed Lightning and Unlicensed Disintegration, the deck aims to establish early board presence and relentlessly pressure the opponent. Thalia, Heretic Cathar adds disruption to slow down the opponent's game plan, while Selfless Spirit provides protection for key threats. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's aggressive game plan."
