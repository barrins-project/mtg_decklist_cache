The win condition is to flip Thing in the Ice into Awoken Horror, or generate card advantage with Torrential Gearhulk. Overall, the deck focuses on maintaining board control and out-valuing the opponent through efficient spellcasting and strategic plays."

The deck utilizes cards like Grim Flayer and Traverse the Ulvenwald to fill the graveyard and find key threats like Emrakul, the Promised End. Liliana, the Last Hope provides additional removal and graveyard recursion, while Ishkanah, Grafwidow and Noxious Gearhulk offer strong defensive options. The deck aims to grind out the opponent with card advantage and powerful threats, ultimately overwhelming them with a steady stream of threats and removal."

It also includes defensive options like Reflector Mage and Selfless Spirit to protect its board presence. Utilizing cards like Stasis Snare and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar to control the opponent's board, this deck seeks to quickly assemble a powerful force and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The addition of Smuggler's Copter provides card advantage and helps maintain aggression."
