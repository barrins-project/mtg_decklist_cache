By utilizing cards like Springleaf Drum and Prophetic Prism, the deck can easily ramp up its resources and drop multiple artifact creatures onto the battlefield early in the game. Cards like Atog and Fling provide the deck with explosive finishers, while Galvanic Blast and Thoughtcast help to keep the engine running smoothly. Overall, the deck aims to flood the board with artifacts and overwhelm the opponent with a fast, aggressive game plan."
