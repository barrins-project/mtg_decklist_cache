The key strategy is to maintain pressure with early creatures like Inventor's Apprentice and Bomat Courier, while leveraging cards like Smuggler's Copter and Key to the City for card advantage and evasion. Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides additional removal and card advantage, while Unlicensed Disintegration is a versatile removal spell that also doubles as direct damage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and consistent aggressive strategy."
