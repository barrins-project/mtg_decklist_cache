The key strategy is to use cheap artifacts like Memnite and Ornithopter to enable Metalcraft for Mox Opal and Galvanic Blast. Arcbound Ravager can also be sacrificed to add counters to other creatures or to protect important pieces. Inkmoth Nexus provides an alternate win condition with infect damage. The deck is fast and aggressive, aiming to win before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
