The deck focuses on controlling the board state and out-valuing your opponent with powerful threats like Monastery Mentor and Snapcaster Mage."

            "notes": "This UR Aggro Legacy deck focuses on fast, efficient spells to disrupt the opponent while applying pressure with aggressive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Young Pyromancer. The deck is built to control the game through counterspells like Force of Will, as well as tempo plays like Stifle and Daze. The inclusion of True-Name Nemesis provides a difficult-to-answer threat, while Lightning Bolt and Grim Lavamancer offer additional removal options. The mana base is optimized for consistency and to support the deck's strategy of quickly overwhelming opponents."
