The creatures in the deck, such as Stormchaser Mage, Monastery Swiftspear, and Delver of Secrets, serve as additional sources of damage and pressure on the opponent. Force of Will and Daze are included to protect the deck's strategy and maintain its tempo."

The deck also utilizes efficient mana denial through cards like Rishadan Port and Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's mana base. With powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Sword of Fire and Ice, the deck can quickly close out games by buffing its creatures and providing additional value."
