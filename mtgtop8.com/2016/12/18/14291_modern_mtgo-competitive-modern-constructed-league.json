The key strategy involves playing low cost creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear alongside powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish the opponent for playing spells, while Atarka's Command and Boros Charm provide additional reach and versatility. The mana base is optimized to consistently cast spells and maximize damage output."

The secondary win condition comes from the incremental advantage generated by cards like Liliana of the Veil and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy, allowing for a versatile and adaptive playstyle."
