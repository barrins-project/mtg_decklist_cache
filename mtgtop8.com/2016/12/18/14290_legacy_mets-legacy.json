By combining cards like Reanimate, Entomb, and Animate Dead with mana acceleration like Lotus Petal and Dark Ritual, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with their reanimated threats early in the game. Thoughtseize and Unmask provide disruption for the opponent's game plan, while Faithless Looting helps find key pieces for the combo. The deck is designed to be fast, aggressive, and resilient in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
