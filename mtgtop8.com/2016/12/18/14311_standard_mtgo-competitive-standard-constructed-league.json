The deck also utilizes powerful creatures like Grim Flayer and Torrential Gearhulk to apply pressure and close out the game. By combining a variety of removal, card draw, and threats, the deck aims to establish board control and win the game through attrition and efficient resource management. The inclusion of Emrakul, the Promised End provides a powerful late-game threat that can turn the tide of the game in your favor."
