The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering key spells with cards like Mana Leak and Cryptic Command, while also having removal options like Path to Exile and Supreme Verdict. Card advantage is gained through cards like Esper Charm and Sphinx's Revelation, allowing the player to draw cards or gain life. The deck also utilizes Snapcaster Mage to recast important spells from the graveyard, ensuring maximum efficiency in controlling the game."
