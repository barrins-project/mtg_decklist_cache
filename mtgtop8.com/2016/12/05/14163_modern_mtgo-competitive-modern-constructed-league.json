It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining card advantage with spells like Cryptic Command and Ancestral Vision. It also utilizes cards like Snapcaster Mage and Tasigur, the Golden Fang for value and board presence. The mana base is optimized for fetching dual lands and casting spells across all three colors, with a few creature lands for additional win conditions. The deck's game plan revolves around out-valuing the opponent and eventually closing out the game with efficient threats."
