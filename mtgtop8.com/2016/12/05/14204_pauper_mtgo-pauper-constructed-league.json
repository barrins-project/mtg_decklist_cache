By using efficient creatures like Ardent Recruit and Auriok Sunchaser along with equipment such as Bonesplitter and Tooth of Chiss-Goria, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a swarm of creatures, backed up by Renegade Freighters for extra damage. With a mix of artifact creatures and non-artifact creatures, this deck is able to utilize the artifact lands Ancient Den and Darksteel Citadel to further support its aggressive strategy."
