The deck aims to control the game by managing the board state and card advantage, ultimately leading to a win through attrition. By leveraging its versatile spell options and card selection, the deck can adapt to different matchups and outmaneuver opponents in a variety of ways."

The deck includes various pump spells and protection spells to make the infect creatures like Glistener Elf and Blighted Agent deal lethal damage efficiently. The key strategy is to play fast, aggressive creatures and use pump spells like Mutagenic Growth and Become Immense to maximize damage output and close out the game before the opponent can respond effectively."
