By utilizing efficient cantrips such as Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain, along with counter magic like Force of Will and Spell Pierce, the deck aims to protect its combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes powerful planeswalker Jace, the Mind Sculptor for additional card advantage and control. This fast and explosive strategy makes it a formidable force in the Legacy format."
