            "notes": "The main concept of this Mardu Aggro deck is to apply constant pressure on the opponent by efficiently deploying aggressive creatures and utilizing powerful removal spells. The deck focuses on early board presence with cards like Toolcraft Exemplar, Thraben Inspector, and Scrapheap Scrounger, paired with evasion and card filtering from Smuggler's Copter. Thalia, Heretic Cathar disrupts the opponent's tempo, while Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides a strong finisher. Unlicensed Disintegration and Harnessed Lightning offer removal options to clear the way for attacks, giving the deck a versatile and aggressive game plan."

By combining efficient creatures like Bloodhall Priest and Scrapheap Scrounger with powerful removal spells like Fiery Temper and Unlicensed Disintegration, the goal is to put pressure on the opponent early and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. Key to the City and Smuggler's Copter provide additional ways to push through damage and maintain card advantage. The key strategy is to be proactive and maintain a fast tempo throughout the game."
