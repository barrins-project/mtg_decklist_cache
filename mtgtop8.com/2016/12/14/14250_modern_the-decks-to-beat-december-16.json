Additionally, the inclusion of Lingering Souls provides a steady stream of threats and value. With a strong mana base and a mix of removal and hand disruption, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and resilient game plan."

Once Valakut is active, the goal is to cast Scapeshift to sacrifice lands and deal massive damage to the opponent by fetching multiple copies of Mountain from the deck. Primeval Titan and Courser of Kruphix help to generate extra lands and provide additional utility. Overall, the deck aims to assemble the combo pieces quickly and overwhelm the opponent with a powerful burst of damage."
