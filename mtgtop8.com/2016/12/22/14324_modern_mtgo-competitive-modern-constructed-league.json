The deck aims to be relentless in its aggression and explosive in its victories."

            "notes": "The deck revolves around playing low-cost creatures and spells to quickly deal damage to the opponent. It focuses on efficient creatures like Delver of Secrets and Monastery Swiftspear to pressure the opponent, supported by burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Burst Lightning. The deck also includes card draw spells like Serum Visions and Gitaxian Probe to maintain card advantage. The goal is to apply constant pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan with counterspells like Remand and Spell Pierce, eventually overwhelming them with damage to win the game."
