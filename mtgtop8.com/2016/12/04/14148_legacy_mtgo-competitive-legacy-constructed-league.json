By repeatedly bouncing and recasting these creatures, the deck can generate advantage and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes value cards like Shardless Agent and Deathrite Shaman to further enhance its game plan. The key strategy revolves around utilizing Aluren to create a powerful engine that can overwhelm the opponent with card advantage and tempo."

The deck includes a mix of cheap spells and counter magic to control the game and protect its threats. By deploying threats early and maintaining pressure, the deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize or mount a significant defense. The inclusion of card draw and selection spells helps to ensure consistency and find the necessary pieces to execute its game plan effectively."
