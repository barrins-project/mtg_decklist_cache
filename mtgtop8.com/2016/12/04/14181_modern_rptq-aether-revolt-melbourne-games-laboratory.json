            "notes": "This deck focuses on using Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle in combination with Scapeshift or Primeval Titan to deal massive amounts of direct damage to the opponent. The deck also includes ramp spells like Farseek and Sakura-Tribe Elder to accelerate mana production, allowing for quicker activations of Valakut's ability. Removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods help control the board while cards like Explore and Khalni Heart Expedition provide card advantage and additional land drops. The goal is to assemble the combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with damage before they can mount a defense."
