The key strategy is to control the board with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze while also burning the opponent with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Price of Progress. The deck aims to tempo out opponents by combining card advantage from cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder with efficient threats that demand immediate answers. A fast, aggressive playstyle is crucial to overwhelm opponents before they have a chance to stabilize."
