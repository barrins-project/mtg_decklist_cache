Key cards like Bloodhall Priest and Pia Nalaar provide value on attacking, while cards like Unlicensed Disintegration and Incendiary Flow can remove threats from the opponent's board. The inclusion of Key to the City allows for card filtering and unblockable attacks, while Smuggler's Copter provides additional card advantage and evasion. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain a steady stream of threats to overwhelm the opponent."
