It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Stifle and Daze, while also maintaining board presence with threats like Nimble Mongoose and Delver of Secrets. The deck utilizes efficient spells like Lightning Bolt and Force of Will to handle threats and protect its own creatures. The combination of disruptive spells, efficient threats, and mana denial from Wasteland creates a fast-paced, aggressive strategy that aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly."
