Ishkanah, Grafwidow provides defense and a back-up win condition, while Chandra, Torch of Defiance offers additional removal and card advantage. The deck aims to control the board and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."

Powerful aggressive creatures like Scrapheap Scrounger and Thraben Inspector provide both consistent damage and card advantage, while support cards like Declaration in Stone help to clear any potential blockers in the way. Additionally, the inclusion of Smuggler's Copter provides extra evasion and card filtering for the deck."
