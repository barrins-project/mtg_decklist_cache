This allows the player to control what their opponent draws, while using cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Pithing Needle to keep themselves safe from attacks and key abilities. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Thoughtseize and Surgical Extraction to further disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to control the game until it can find its win condition and close out the game."
