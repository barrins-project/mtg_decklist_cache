The deck also includes a mill strategy with cards like Startled Awake and Manic Scribe to put pressure on the opponent's library. Consulate Skygate and Engulf the Shore provide additional control elements, while Pilgrim's Eye and Filigree Familiar help fix mana and gain some life. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent through control and card advantage."
