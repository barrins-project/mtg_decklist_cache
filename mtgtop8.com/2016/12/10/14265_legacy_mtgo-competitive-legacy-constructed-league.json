            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to utilize the Elves tribe to generate a large amount of mana and card advantage through cards such as Glimpse of Nature and Wirewood Symbiote. The deck aims to quickly assemble a board of Elves, using Green Sun's Zenith and Natural Order to find key creatures like Craterhoof Behemoth to finish off the opponent in a massive attack. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Reclamation Sage and Deathrite Shaman to help control the game while setting up the combo."
