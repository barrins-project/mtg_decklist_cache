The deck also utilizes cards like Nourishing Shoal and Faithless Looting to set up the combo and dig for the necessary pieces. The inclusion of cards like Desperate Ritual and Simian Spirit Guide help accelerate the deck's game plan, while cards like Izzet Charm and Night's Whisper provide additional utility and card draw. The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with big creatures and win the game in just a few turns."
