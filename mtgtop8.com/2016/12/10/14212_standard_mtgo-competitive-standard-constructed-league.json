            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing aggressive Azorius creatures to quickly apply pressure to the opponent while also disrupting their game plan with counterspells and removal spells. The key strategy is to establish a board presence early with efficient creatures like Thraben Inspector and Spell Queller, and then protect them with Selfless Spirit and Reflector Mage. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Archangel Avacyn provide additional ways to close out the game or protect your board. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of efficient threats and disruptive plays."
