It includes various removal spells, counterspells, and card draw effects to both disrupt the opponent's game plan and ensure a steady stream of resources for the player. The deck also includes a finisher in the form of Ulamog's Crusher, which can quickly close out the game once the player has established control. This archetype aims to out-value and outlast the opponent through efficient use of its resources."
