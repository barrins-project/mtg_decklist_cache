The combo relies on using Aetherworks Marvel's ability to get ahead on mana and cast game-winning Eldrazi threats early in the game. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Woodweaver's Puzzleknot and Servant of the Conduit to further enhance energy production and enable the combo to go off smoothly."
