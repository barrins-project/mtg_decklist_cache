Flicker effects with Eldrazi Displacer can also provide value by blinking creatures for additional ETB effects. With a mix of disruption and aggressive creatures, this deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents in a 1 vs 1 format."

Surgical Extraction and Thoughtseize help disrupt the opponent's game plan further, while Abrupt Decay provides versatile removal. The deck also utilizes card filtering with Ancient Stirrings and Mishra's Bauble, and has access to additional resources with Mox Opal and Inventors' Fair."

The key strategy revolves around playing cheap spells like Lightning Bolt and Mutagenic Growth to trigger powerful abilities on creatures like Kiln Fiend and Thing in the Ice, while also drawing through the deck with cards like Gitaxian Probe and Serum Visions. By leveraging these synergies, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of aggressive plays and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
