By utilizing cards like Reflector Mage and Spell Queller to control the opponent's board, along with protection from Selfless Spirit, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent. With tempo plays like Revolutionary Rebuff and removal options like Stasis Snare, the deck can disrupt the opponent's game plan while continuing to apply pressure. The mana base allows for consistent access to both white and blue mana sources to support the deck's aggressive strategy."
