It includes card draw, removal, counterspells, and recursion to outvalue opponents. The main win conditions are either overwhelming the opponent with large spells like Rolling Thunder or by grinding them out with card advantage and efficient removal. The deck focuses on establishing a dominant board presence and leveraging its mana advantage to consistently outplay opponents in the late game."
