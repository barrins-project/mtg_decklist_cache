The inclusion of vehicles like Smuggler's Copter and Fleetwheel Cruiser allows for additional threats and evasion.

The deck aims to apply pressure early on and disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thalia, Heretic Cathar and Unlicensed Disintegration. Utilizing vehicles like Smuggler's Copter and Cultivator's Caravan allows for aggressive attacks while maintaining card advantage. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to all the colors needed for a well-rounded aggro strategy."
