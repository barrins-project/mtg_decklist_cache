This is achieved by drawing cards with spells like Ponder, Preordain, and Gitaxian Probe, and then using cards like Infernal Tutor to search for specific combo pieces like Tendrils of Agony or Ad Nauseam. The deck also includes disruption spells like Cabal Therapy and Duress to disrupt the opponent's game plan."

The deck aims to disrupt opponents with counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce while digging for combo pieces with cards like Ponder and Brainstorm. The deck also includes fast mana sources like Ancient Tomb and City of Traitors to accelerate its game plan. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats before they can react effectively."
