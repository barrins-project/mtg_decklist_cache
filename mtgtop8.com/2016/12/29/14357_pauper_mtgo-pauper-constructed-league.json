The deck utilizes counterspells like Condescend and Exclude to stop opponent's threats, and removal spells like Electrickery and Firebolt to deal with creatures. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game and outlasting the opponent."

The deck aims to apply pressure early with aggressive creatures and maintain tempo by keeping the opponent off balance with counterspells and card draw. By combining aggro elements with midrange versatility, the deck can adapt to various board states and strategies, ultimately aiming to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient creatures and disruptive spells."
