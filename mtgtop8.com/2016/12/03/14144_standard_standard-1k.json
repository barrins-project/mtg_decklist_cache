With powerful threats like Mindwrack Demon, Kalitas, and Emrakul, the deck can also close out games quickly once it has stabilized the board."

By using cards like Void Shatter, Negate, and Revolutionary Rebuff to counter opponent's spells, as well as cards like Radiant Flames, Immolating Glare, and Descend upon the Sinful to remove threats from the board, the deck aims to lock down the opponent's game plan. Additionally, cards like Glimmer of Genius and Nahiri, the Harbinger provide card advantage and selection, ensuring the player has the tools they need to control the game until they can drop their finisher, Torrential Gearhulk."
