It relies on a combination of mana denial through cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port, along with creature control through cards like Swords to Plowshares and Phyrexian Revoker. The deck also utilizes Aether Vial to cheat in creatures with disruptive abilities, such as Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Sanctum Prelate. Stoneforge Mystic and Mother of Runes help to find and protect powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Sword of Fire and Ice. Overall, the main concept is to disrupt the opponent's plans while establishing a strong board presence."

The deck aims to quickly ramp up mana production to cast a lethal Craterhoof Behemoth for a game-winning attack. The inclusion of disruptive elements like Deathrite Shaman, Reclamation Sage, and Leovold, Emissary of Trest helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining the combo. The deck's win condition revolves around overwhelming the opponent with a large number of powerful Elf creatures."
