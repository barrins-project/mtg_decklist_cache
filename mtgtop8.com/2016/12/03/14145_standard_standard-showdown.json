By combining cards like Foundry Inspector, Metalwork Colossus, and Glint-Nest Crane with cards that provide card draw and mana ramp like Prophetic Prism and Cultivator's Caravan, the deck can quickly take control of the board. This is further supported by removal spells like Fumigate and Spatial Contortion, as well as creatures like Elder Deep-Fiend and Skysovereign, Consul Flagship to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent."
