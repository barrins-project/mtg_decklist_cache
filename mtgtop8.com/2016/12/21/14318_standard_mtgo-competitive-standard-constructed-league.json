By generating energy with cards like Woodweaver's Puzzleknot and Servant of the Conduit, players can trigger Marvel's ability to put game-changing creatures into play. Supporting cards like Harnessed Lightning provide removal options, while Nahiri, the Harbinger helps with card selection and Emrakul recursion. Overall, the strategy revolves around quickly assembling the Marvel combo to overwhelm opponents with massive threats."

The inclusion of powerful cards like Skysovereign, Consul Flagship and Thought-Knot Seer provides additional threats and disruption, making it difficult for opponents to stabilize. The deck also has some deck disruption and removal options to clear a path for the aggressive creatures."
