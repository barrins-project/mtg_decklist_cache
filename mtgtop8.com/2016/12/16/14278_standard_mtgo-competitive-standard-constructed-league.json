The inclusion of cards like Thraben Inspector and Smuggler's Copter provides card advantage and additional utility to keep the pressure on the opponent. Overall, the deck is designed to quickly overwhelm opponents and secure victories through a combination of aggression and disruption."

The inclusion of Smuggler's Copter allows for additional card draw and a reliable way to push damage through. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggression and disruption."

The deck also includes cards like Nahiri, the Harbinger and Descend upon the Sinful for removal and board control. The strategy revolves around using Marvelous Energy to cheat out big threats and overwhelm the opponent before they can respond effectively."
