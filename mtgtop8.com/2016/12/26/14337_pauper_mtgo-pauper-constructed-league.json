By using cards like Abundant Growth and Utopia Sprawl to ramp up mana, players can play multiple auras on their creatures to create huge threats. The deck focuses on creating a fast and powerful board presence that can deal significant damage to the opponent before they have a chance to react. Adding in cards like Ancestral Mask and Armadillo Cloak can quickly turn a small creature into a massive threat, ending the game in just a few turns."
