By utilizing cards like Cavern Harpy and Parasitic Strix, the deck aims to generate card advantage and create a powerful board presence with creatures like Leovold, Emissary of Trest and Baleful Strix. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Leovold and Deathrite Shaman to control the opponent's plays. The mana base is tuned to support the deck's multicolor requirements."
