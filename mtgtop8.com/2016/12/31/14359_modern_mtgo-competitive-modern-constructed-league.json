By combining cheap cantrips and prowess creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Kiln Fiend with powerful pump spells like Temur Battle Rage and Mutagenic Growth, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early in the game. Thing in the Ice serves as a potential finisher or board reset option, while Bedlam Reveler provides card advantage in the later stages of the game. This deck emphasizes speed and aggression to secure a quick victory."
