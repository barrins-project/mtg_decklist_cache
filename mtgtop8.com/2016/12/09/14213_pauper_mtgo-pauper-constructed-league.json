By utilizing cheap spells and mana-efficient creatures, the deck aims to outpace the opponent and overwhelm them with a consistent stream of threats. The inclusion of cards like Snap and Spire Golem allows for tempo swings and disruption, while cards like Faerie Miscreant and Spellstutter Sprite provide additional value and disruption."
