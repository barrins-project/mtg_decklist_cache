The deck focuses on quickly dropping threats like Young Wolf, Skarrgan Pit-Skulk, and other low-cost creatures, while using cards like Rancor and Vines of Vastwood to pump them up and push for damage. The deck also includes some removal and protection spells to ensure your creatures can push through for the win. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, aggressive, and relentless in its pursuit of victory."
