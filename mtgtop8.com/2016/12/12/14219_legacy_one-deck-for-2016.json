It aims to cheat these creatures into play to overwhelm the opponent in the early turns of the game. The deck also includes counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect its game-winning plays. It utilizes card draw and selection spells like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain to help find its combo pieces quickly. The deck's main goal is to set up a powerful combo and win the game through sheer speed and efficiency."
