This deck aims to grind out its opponents through attrition and resource denial."

By playing aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Wild Nacatl, along with pump spells like Temur Battle Rage and Mutagenic Growth, you can put immense pressure on your opponent. Thoughtseize and Mishra's Bauble help to disrupt your opponent's game plan while also providing valuable information. The deck also includes efficient removal such as Lightning Bolt to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the key strategy is to play aggressively and use Death's Shadow as a large, hard-hitting threat."

The deck aims to finish the game as quickly as possible by dealing 10 poison counters to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense helps protect the infect creatures from removal spells, while Gitaxian Probe provides information on the opponent's hand. Overall, the deck focuses on a fast and aggressive strategy to win the game through poison counters."
