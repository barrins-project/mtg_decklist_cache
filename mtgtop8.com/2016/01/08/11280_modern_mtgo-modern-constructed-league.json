The key strategy is to overwhelm your opponent with strong, hexproof creatures that can deal a lot of damage quickly, making it difficult for them to effectively counter or block your attacks."

By chaining spells, the player can generate massive amounts of mana and draw through their deck quickly. Glittering Wish allows access to key combo pieces from the sideboard, while Fatestitcher can be used to untap lands and enable more spell chaining."
