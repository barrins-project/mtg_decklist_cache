By playing low cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, Abbot of Keral Keep, and Lightning Berserker, as well as cards like Hordeling Outburst and Dragon Fodder to generate token creatures, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Cards like Titan's Strength, Become Immense, and Temur Battle Rage are used to pump up creatures and push through extra damage, while Atarka's Command provides additional reach and utility. Overall, the goal is to win the game as fast as possible through aggressive creature-based attacks."

The main strategy revolves around playing low-cost creatures such as Hordeling Outburst and Hangarback Walker to apply early pressure, while also utilizing spells like Fiery Impulse and Draconic Roar to control the opponent's board and eliminate threats. Additionally, it includes powerful flying creatures like Thunderbreak Regent and Flamewake Phoenix to deal significant damage, supported by a few versatile spells like Kolaghan's Command and Murderous Cut for additional removal and utility."
