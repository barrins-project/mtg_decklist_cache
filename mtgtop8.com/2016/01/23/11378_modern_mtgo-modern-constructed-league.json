            "notes": "The deck heavily relies on a fast and aggressive playstyle by utilizing Merfolk creatures that boost each other's power and toughness, along with disruption spells like Stubborn Denial and Echoing Truth. The strategy involves quickly building a board presence with lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident, while also disrupting opponent's plays with counterspells and bounce effects. Spreading Seas helps to control the opponent's mana base, while Aether Vial allows for creatures to be played at instant speed. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and relentless assault."
