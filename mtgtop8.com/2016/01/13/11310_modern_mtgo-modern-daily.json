            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to use cards like Violent Outburst and Demonic Dread to cast Living End from your graveyard, allowing you to return all creatures with cycling abilities to the battlefield. This combo can quickly overwhelm your opponent with powerful creatures like Monstrous Carabid and Fulminator Mage. Additionally, cards like Beast Within and Simian Spirit Guide provide versatility and acceleration, while the cycling creatures help you dig through your deck to find your combo pieces. The deck aims to disrupt your opponent's strategy and finish the game quickly with a strong board presence."
