Additionally, protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing are included to ensure the creatures can get through for lethal damage. Overall, the deck aims to win the game through infect damage before the opponent can establish their own game plan."

The inclusion of protection spells like Spirit Mantle and Path to Exile further solidifies the strategy of creating a strong, hard-to-interact-with creature."
