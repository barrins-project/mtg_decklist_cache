Once the combo is assembled, the player can win the game with Lightning Storm. Other cards like Phyrexian Unlife and Pact of Negation help to protect the combo and ensure a successful win condition. Additionally, the deck includes efficient card draw and mana ramping with cards like Serum Visions and Simian Spirit Guide, as well as a mix of control elements like Duress and Slaughter Pact."
