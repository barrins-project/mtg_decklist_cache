            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to quickly and efficiently reanimate powerful creatures using instant spells such as Goryo's Vengeance and Through the Breach. By discarding creatures like Worldspine Wurm and Griselbrand with cards like Faithless Looting and Tormenting Voice, the deck aims to cheat these creatures into play early in the game to overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Nourishing Shoal and Manamorphose provides additional flexibility and consistency in executing the combo. The deck focuses on explosive plays and high-powered creatures to quickly close out games."
