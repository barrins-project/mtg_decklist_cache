The combo allows for explosive plays that can overwhelm the opponent in a single turn. The deck also includes cards like Faithless Looting and Night's Whisper to help dig for key pieces of the combo and maintain card advantage. The instant reanimation strategy punishes opponents who aren't able to disrupt the combo quickly."

It aims to apply pressure on the opponent with efficient creatures like Tarmogoyf, Siege Rhino, and Lingering Souls. The deck also has some resilience with cards like Kitchen Finks and Scavenging Ooze to gain life and disrupt graveyard strategies. Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and control elements. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outpace the opponent in a midrange aggro strategy."
