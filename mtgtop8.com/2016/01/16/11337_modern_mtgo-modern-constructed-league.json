The deck includes disruption cards like Remand and Izzet Charm to protect the combo, as well as land destruction spells like Molten Rain and Stone Rain to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Blood Moon is included to further disrupt the opponent's mana, while Anger of the Gods provides board wipe against aggressive decks. Serum Visions helps with consistency and card selection."
