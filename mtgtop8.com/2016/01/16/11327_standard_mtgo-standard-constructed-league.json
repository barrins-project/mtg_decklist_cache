By using efficient and fast creatures like Bloodsoaked Champion and Flamewake Phoenix, combined with burn spells like Wild Slash and Draconic Roar, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total. Cards like Thunderbreak Regent and Ashcloud Phoenix provide a strong late-game presence, while Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury can give the team an extra boost to finish off the opponent. The deck aims to maintain a fast and relentless pace to secure victory."

The deck also includes some smaller creatures for early game defense and mana acceleration. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with big, hard-to-answer threats while maintaining control of the game."
