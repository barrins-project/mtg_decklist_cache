The strategy is to rapidly reduce the opponent's life total while controlling the board with efficient removal spells. By maintaining pressure on the opponent and keeping them on the defensive, this deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can establish their own game plan. It relies on a mix of creatures, burn spells, and land destruction effects to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."
