The deck also aims to generate card advantage and flexibility through cards like Snapcaster Mage and Cryptic Command, while also providing win conditions with creatures like Tasigur, the Golden Fang and Gurmag Angler. The deck utilizes a mix of disruption, removal, and card advantage to control the game and outvalue opponents in order to secure a victory."
