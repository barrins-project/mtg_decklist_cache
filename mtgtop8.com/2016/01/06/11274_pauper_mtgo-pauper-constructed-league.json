With efficient removal spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to damage the opponent's life total before they can establish a strong defense. Key cards like Atog and Auriok Sunchaser can quickly become threats with the high volume of artifacts in the deck. Utilizing a mix of white and red mana sources, this deck can quickly overwhelm opponents with its fast-paced aggression."
