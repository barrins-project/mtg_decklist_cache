The inclusion of Hive Mind adds an additional win condition by forcing opponents to copy spells that may benefit you more than them. Pact cards provide protection and additional utility in combo plays."

The deck aims to close out the game as quickly as possible before the opponent has a chance to stabilize and take control of the match."

The deck aims to leverage the power of Eldrazi creatures to quickly close out the game once it has gained control."
