The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures while utilizing spells like Collected Company and Dromoka's Command to gain incremental advantages. With a strong mana base and a mix of removal, disruption, and creature threats, this deck seeks to maintain pressure and tempo throughout the game to secure a swift victory."
