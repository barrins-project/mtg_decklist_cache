The deck aims to play multiple cheap creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Hordeling Outburst, then use pump spells like Titan's Strength and Temur Battle Rage to deal massive damage. Cards like Become Immense and Atarka's Command provide additional reach and finishing power. Overall, the strategy is to play aggressively, maintain pressure on the opponent, and finish them off before they have a chance to stabilize."
