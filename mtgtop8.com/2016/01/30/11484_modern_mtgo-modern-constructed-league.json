The inclusion of Sun Titan allows for recursion of key cards like Wall of Omens and Detention Sphere, providing additional value in the late game. The deck aims to control the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Detention Sphere, while applying pressure with flying creatures like Vendilion Clique and Restoration Angel. Gideon Jura serves as a powerful win condition, while Kitchen Finks offers resiliency against aggressive strategies.  Ultimately, the deck aims to outvalue opponents and maintain control of the game."
