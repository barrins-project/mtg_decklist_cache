Using counterspells like Mana Leak and Cryptic Command to control the board, supplemented by removal like Lightning Bolt and Roast, the deck aims to survive the early game and take over in the mid to late game. Card draw and selection from Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage help ensure consistency in finding answers and threats. With versatile threats like Pia and Kiran Nalaar and Vendilion Clique, the deck can quickly switch to a more aggressive strategy if needed."
