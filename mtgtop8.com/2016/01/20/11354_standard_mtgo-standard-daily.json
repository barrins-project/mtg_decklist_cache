Utilizing powerful spells like Atarka's Command and Become Immense, the deck aims to deal a significant amount of damage in a short amount of time, overwhelming the opponent with a flurry of quick, efficient attacks. The mana base is designed to support this strategy, allowing for consistent deployment of threats and pump spells."
