The inclusion of Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum helps to generate additional mana to play multiple spells in a turn. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive plays and potentially close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

By utilizing cards like Ethereal Armor, Daybreak Coronet, and Rancor, the deck aims to create a hard-to-remove threat that can quickly close out the game. By including cards like Gladecover Scout and Slippery Bogle, the deck ensures that its key creature will have hexproof, making it difficult for opponents to target or remove. The deck also includes some removal options like Path to Exile to deal with any threats that may arise."
