The deck also includes a variety of removal spells like Abzan Charm and Dromoka's Command to control the board and protect your creatures. With a good mix of creatures, removal, and powerful planeswalkers like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, this deck aims to pressure the opponent and close out the game quickly."
