By utilizing the Titan's ability to fetch lands and create massive board presence, the deck can overwhelm opponents in just a few turns. It also includes various Pact cards to protect the combo and ensure victory. The key strategy is to efficiently ramp and tutor for key pieces to set up a powerful and explosive win."

This allows the player to cast powerful colorless spells such as Karn Liberated, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, and Wurmcoil Engine to control the game and outvalue the opponent. The deck also includes various utility cards like Expedition Map, Sylvan Scrying, and Ancient Stirrings to find the necessary pieces while Pyroclasm and Oblivion Stone provide board control against aggressive strategies. Overall, the deck excels at generating immense mana advantage and overwhelming the opponent with big threats."
