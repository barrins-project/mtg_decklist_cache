It utilizes cards like Planar Outburst and Quarantine Field to clear the battlefield, while also generating card advantage with Sphinx's Tutelage and Ugin's Insight. The win conditions of the deck include locking down creatures with Pacifism and Suppression Bonds, as well as recurring enchantments with Sigil of the Empty Throne and Starfield of Nyx. The goal is to outlast the opponent and overwhelm them with a powerful late-game presence."
