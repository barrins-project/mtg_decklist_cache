Atarka's Command and Trumpet Blast serve as finishers, giving all creatures a power boost to push through for lethal damage.

Dig Through Time is used to find key cards while Tasigur, the Golden Fang provides card advantage. The deck also includes versatile spells like Utter End and Orator of Ojutai to handle a variety of threats."
