By disrupting the opponent's hand with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, it aims to clear the way for its creatures to deal damage and control the board. With a mix of powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and versatile removal spells like Terminate and Abrupt Decay, it can handle a variety of threats while maintaining a proactive game plan. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent casting of its spells."
