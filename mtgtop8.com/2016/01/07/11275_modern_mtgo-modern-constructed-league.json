Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel, Goblin Guide, and Monastery Swiftspear provide early pressure, while cards like Lava Spike, Lightning Bolt, and Boros Charm help finish off the opponent before they can stabilize. The deck aims to be fast and efficient, using a combination of creatures and burn spells to close out the game before the opponent can mount a defense."

By using cards like Collected Company and Chord of Calling to find key pieces like Knight of the Reliquary and Retreat to Coralhelm, the deck can generate incremental advantage and create a powerful board presence. The toolbox nature of the deck allows for versatile answers to various situations, while also having the potential to go for a quick combo win. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's strategy and ensure consistency in casting its spells."
