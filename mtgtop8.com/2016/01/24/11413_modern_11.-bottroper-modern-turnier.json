The deck also features some disruption and protection with cards like Chord of Calling and Dauntless Escort.

The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creatures with haste and direct damage spells, while also using spells like Boros Charm for additional reach or protection. It aims to end the game as quickly as possible by applying constant pressure and forcing the opponent to react defensively. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to the necessary colors for casting spells and activating abilities."
