It aims to flood the board with small, cheap creatures such as Hordeling Outburst, Dragon Fodder, and Monastery Swiftspear, then use burn spells like Wild Slash and Fiery Impulse to clear the way for them to attack. Cards like Titan's Strength and Become Immense provide additional damage boosts, while Atarka's Command can be used both offensively and defensively. Overall, the deck's goal is to deal as much damage as possible in a short amount of time to secure a victory."
