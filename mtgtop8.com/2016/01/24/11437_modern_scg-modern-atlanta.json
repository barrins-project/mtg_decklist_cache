By utilizing efficient creatures like Goblin Guide and Tarmogoyf alongside burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Atarka's Command, the deck aims to apply pressure early in the game and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive playstyle, while also providing access to a variety of colors for versatile spell casting. The deck seeks to win through fast and relentless attacks backed up by direct damage spells."
