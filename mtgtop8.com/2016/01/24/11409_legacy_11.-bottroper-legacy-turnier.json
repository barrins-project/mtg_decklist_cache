The deck aims to stall the game until it can stabilize with powerful threats like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Entreat the Angels. By utilizing a combination of counterspells like Force of Will and Counterspell, along with cards like Terminus and Council's Judgment, the deck is well-equipped to handle a variety of threats and maintain control of the game until it can close it out with its win conditions."
