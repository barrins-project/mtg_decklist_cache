The deck includes control elements like Dispel, Remand, and Cryptic Command to protect the combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Snapcaster Mage and Vendilion Clique provide additional value and disruption, while Lightning Bolt and Electrolyze serve as removal. The mana base is optimized for consistency and includes utility lands like Boseiju, Who Shelters All and Desolate Lighthouse."
