The deck also includes a versatile removal package with cards like Lightning Bolt, Terminate, and Kolaghan's Command to deal with opposing threats. The inclusion of powerful threats like Goblin Dark-Dwellers and Gurmag Angler provides additional finishers to close out the game quickly. The deck aims to maintain a balance between aggression and control to dominate the battlefield."
