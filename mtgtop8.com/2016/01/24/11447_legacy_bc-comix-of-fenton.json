            "notes": "The main concept of this Legacy Combo - Storm deck is to quickly generate mana through spells like Dark Ritual and Cabal Ritual, while also digging for key combo pieces with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with hand disruption spells like Duress and Cabal Therapy, while also gaining information and drawing cards with Gitaxian Probe. The primary win condition is to cast multiple spells in a turn, building up storm count, and finishing off the opponent with Tendrils of Agony or Ad Nauseam. The deck is designed for fast and explosive gameplay."
