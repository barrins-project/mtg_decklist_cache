By using aggressive red creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Zurgo Bellstriker alongside token generators like Dragon Fodder and Hordeling Outburst, the deck aims to deal quick damage to the opponent. With the help of pump spells like Titan's Strength and Become Immense, as well as combat tricks like Temur Battle Rage, the deck can deliver unexpected bursts of damage and secure victory before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
