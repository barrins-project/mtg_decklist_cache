            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of artifact creatures and boosting their power with Cranial Plating. By using cards like Arcbound Ravager and Steel Overseer, along with the efficient mana acceleration from Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, the deck can quickly assemble a lethal board state. The key strategy is to aggressively attack, utilizing cards like Signal Pest and Vault Skirge to chip away at the opponent's life total while also presenting difficult to deal with threats like Etched Champion. The deck is able to produce explosive starts and close out games quickly."
