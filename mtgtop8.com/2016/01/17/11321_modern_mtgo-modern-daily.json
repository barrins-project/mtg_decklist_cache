The deck also utilizes the aggressive capabilities of Wild Nacatl and Tasigur, the Golden Fang to apply early pressure. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Boros Charm and Atarka's Command provide versatility and additional reach in closing out the game. Overall, this deck aims to be fast, relentless, and overwhelming in its offensive strategies."
