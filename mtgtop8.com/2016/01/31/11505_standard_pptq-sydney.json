The deck includes creatures that have beneficial effects when they enter the battlefield or leave the battlefield. By using Rally the Ancestors, the player can bring back multiple creatures from their graveyard, triggering these effects multiple times and potentially overwhelming the opponent with a combination of abilities and damage. The deck also includes cards with sacrifice abilities, such as Nantuko Husk and Zulaport Cutthroat, to maximize the damage and gain additional advantages from sacrificing creatures. Overall, the deck focuses on quickly assembling a powerful board presence and overwhelming the opponent with the combo."
