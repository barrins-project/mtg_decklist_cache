The deck also includes cards like Den Protector and Wingmate Roc for additional value and resilience. The mana base is optimized to ensure consistent access to the necessary colors while maintaining a steady stream of threats.

The deck aims to grind out the opponent over time, using card advantage from spells like Read the Bones and strong finishers like Secure the Wastes to secure a victory. It can adapt to various situations with a mix of removal, lifegain, and powerful threats."
