            "notes": "The key focus of this deck is to quickly flood the board with aggressive creatures and then enhance their power with combat tricks and pump spells. By using efficient one-drop creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Zurgo Bellstriker alongside landfall creatures like Scythe Leopard and Snapping Gnarlid, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with early pressure. Utilizing spells like Titan's Strength, Become Immense, and Temur Battle Rage further boosts the deck's aggressive strategy, allowing for quick and decisive victories in 1 vs 1 matchups."
