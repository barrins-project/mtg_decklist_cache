Utilizing fast and efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, Zurgo Bellstriker, and Abbot of Keral Keep, as well as pump spells like Titan's Strength and Become Immense, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with high-powered attacks. Atarka's Command provides additional reach and versatility, allowing for direct damage as well as buffing the team. This deck is all about aggressive and explosive gameplay."
