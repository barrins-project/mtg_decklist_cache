By leveraging mana efficiency and card advantage, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while deploying threats like Delver of Secrets and Ninja of the Deep Hours to apply pressure and generate additional value. With a strong emphasis on protecting its creatures and maintaining a steady stream of disruptive spells, the deck aims to outmaneuver opponents in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
