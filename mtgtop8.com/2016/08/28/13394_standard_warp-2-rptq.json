By using cards like Ruinous Path, Grasp of Darkness, and Languish, the deck aims to keep the opponent's board clear while generating card advantage with Transgress the Mind and Read the Bones. The planeswalkers, specifically Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Liliana, the Last Hope, provide additional threats and value to help secure the win. The mana base is designed to consistently have access to both black and white mana sources for optimal spell casting."
