The deck focuses on generating card advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Sensei's Divining Top, while also utilizing powerful enchantments like Counterbalance to control the board.

            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game by countering spells, controlling the top of the opponent's library with Counterbalance and Terminus, and manipulating the top of its own library with Sensei's Divining Top. It also has access to removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and board wipes like Terminus to handle threats. The deck can also win through a slow grind with Jace, the Mind Sculptor or a fast finish with Entreat the Angels. The mana base is built to support the control elements of the deck with a mix of fetch lands and dual lands."
