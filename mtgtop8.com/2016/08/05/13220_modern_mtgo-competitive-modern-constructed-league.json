It uses a combination of mana acceleration, disruptive creatures, and strong tribal synergies to maintain pressure and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of Collected Company allows for explosive turns by putting multiple creatures into play at once. The deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent can set up their own game plan, utilizing a mix of creatures with various abilities to keep the opponent off balance."
