The synergy between cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Always Watching helps to boost the power and toughness of your creatures, while cards like Declaration in Stone and Gryff's Boon provide removal and evasion options. The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent and control the board with a mix of aggressive creatures and support spells, ultimately leading to a swift victory."
