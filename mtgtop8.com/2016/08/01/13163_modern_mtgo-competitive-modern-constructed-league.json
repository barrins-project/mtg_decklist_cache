The ultimate goal is to cast Scapeshift to search for Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and enough Mountains to deal lethal damage to the opponent. Snapcaster Mage provides flexibility and card advantage, while other spells like Remand and Unsubstantiate help to delay the opponent's plans. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can win with a powerful Scapeshift combo."
