By utilizing mana ramp with Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, the deck can overwhelm opponents with a flurry of attacks. With the inclusion of cards like Galvanic Blast for removal and protection spells like Welding Jar, the deck aims to maintain board presence and push for fast, aggressive victories. The use of Nexus lands provides additional resilience and evasion, making it difficult for opponents to stop the onslaught of artifact creatures."
