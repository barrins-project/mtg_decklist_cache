The deck focuses on removing threats with cards like Anguished Unmaking, Ruinous Path, and Grasp of Darkness, while also making use of powerful planeswalkers like Sorin, Grim Nemesis and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar to generate card advantage and pressure the opponent. Additionally, the deck is able to stabilize the board with cards like Planar Outburst and Languish, while also providing a win condition with Secure the Wastes and Westvale Abbey."
