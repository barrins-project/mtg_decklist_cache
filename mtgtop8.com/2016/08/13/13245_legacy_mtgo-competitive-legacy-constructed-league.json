Snapcaster Mage provides additional value by flashing back important spells from the graveyard. This deck prioritizes tempo and card advantage to overwhelm opponents and close out games quickly."

The win condition comes from efficiently removing threats with Swords to Plowshares and Terminus, while generating card advantage with Monastery Mentor and Snapcaster Mage. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional card advantage and control options. The mana base is carefully designed to support the deck's blue and white requirements. The key concept is to outlast and outmaneuver opponents through careful resource management."
