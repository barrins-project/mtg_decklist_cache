It aims to control the game with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Rolling Thunder while drawing cards with Mulldrifter and Sea Gate Oracle. The deck also has ways to gain life and recover key cards from the graveyard. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Fangren Marauder and Ulamog's Crusher."
