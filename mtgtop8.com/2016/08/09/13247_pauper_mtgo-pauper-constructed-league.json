By efficiently tapping artifacts for mana and drawing additional cards, the deck aims to maintain a steady stream of threats while also having removal options in hand. The key to victory lies in quickly establishing a board presence and utilizing cards like Atog and Fling to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
