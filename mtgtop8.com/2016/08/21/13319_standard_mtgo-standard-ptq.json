By playing a mix of powerful creatures like Sylvan Advocate and Spell Queller, as well as disruptive spells like Reflector Mage and Dromoka's Command, the deck aims to control the board while dealing consistent damage to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Collected Company and Ojutai's Command allows for flexibility and card advantage, making it a versatile and aggressive deck in a Standard 1 vs 1 format."
