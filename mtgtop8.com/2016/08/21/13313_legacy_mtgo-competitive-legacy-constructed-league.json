By setting up Counterbalance with Sensei's Divining Top, you can counter your opponent's spells with ease. Additionally, the deck includes key removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Terminus to deal with threats efficiently. With powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, you can close out the game once you have established control over the board."

By using acceleration like Simian Spirit Guide and Ancient Tomb, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures like Reality Smasher and Endbringer while also utilizing utility lands like Eye of Ugin and Wasteland to control the game. The deck's strategy revolves around fast, aggressive plays that can win the game before the opponent has a chance to set up their own game plan."
