Tamiyo, Field Researcher provides additional utility and card advantage to keep the pressure on the opponent."

This deck aims to deal large amounts of damage early in the game, using efficient spells like Lightning Bolt and Temur Battle Rage alongside aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Death's Shadow. By carefully managing your own life total and utilizing the powerful abilities of Death's Shadow, this deck is designed to overwhelm opponents quickly and decisively."

It uses colorless spells and artifacts to control the game, deal with threats, and search for key pieces of the combo. The deck also includes powerful Eldrazi creatures like Emrakul and Ulamog as win conditions. By controlling the board with removal spells and powerful planeswalkers like Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win in the late game."
