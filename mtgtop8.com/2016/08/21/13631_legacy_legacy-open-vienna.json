The deck aims to apply pressure early on with aggressive creatures like Mirran Crusader and Serra Avenger, while also having answers in the form of removal and protection through Mother of Runes. The overall strategy revolves around disrupting the opponent's strategy while developing your own board presence."

The deck aims to control the board with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze, while also dealing direct damage with cards like Lightning Bolt and Price of Progress. By utilizing cantrips like Brainstorm, Gitaxian Probe, and Ponder, the deck can filter through its library quickly to find the necessary threats and answers. Overall, the deck focuses on applying constant pressure and maintaining tempo to secure a victory."
