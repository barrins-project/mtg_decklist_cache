It includes a mix of counterspells like Spell Pierce and Force of Will to protect your combo pieces, along with card draw and manipulation cards like Brainstorm and Ponder to find the cards you need. Jace, the Mind Sculptor serves as additional card advantage and manipulation. The goal is to get your big creatures into play as quickly as possible to overwhelm your opponent."
