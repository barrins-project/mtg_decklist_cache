            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game by disrupting opponent's strategies through cards like Ensnaring Bridge, Rest in Peace, and Helm of Obedience. It also uses cards like Lantern of Insight and Codex Shredder to manipulate the top of opponent's library and prevent them from drawing crucial cards. The deck's win conditions are to mill the opponent's library with Helm of Obedience or to lock them out of the game with cards like Energy Field and Pyxis of Pandemonium. The deck aims to control the game and grind out victories through attrition."
