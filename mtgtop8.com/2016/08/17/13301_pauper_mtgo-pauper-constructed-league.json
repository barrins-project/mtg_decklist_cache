By efficiently controlling the board with counterspells and removal, while also generating card advantage through cantrips and graveyard recursion, the deck aims to outpace and overwhelm the opponent's resources. The key strategy is to use the Delver of Secrets as a quick clock while also leveraging the power of Gurmag Angler as a strong finisher. The deck's versatility and resilience make it a formidable Aggro deck in the Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
