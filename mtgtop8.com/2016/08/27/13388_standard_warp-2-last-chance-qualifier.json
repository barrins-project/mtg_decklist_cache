            "notes": "This Orzhov Control deck focuses on disruption and removal, using a combination of hand disruption spells like Transgress the Mind and removal spells like Grasp of Darkness to control the board. The deck also includes powerful threats like Reality Smasher and Archangel Avacyn to close out the game. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Liliana, the Last Hope provide additional value and versatility. The inclusion of cards like Wasteland Strangler and Anguished Unmaking further enhances the deck's removal capabilities, making it difficult for opponents to establish a strong board presence."
