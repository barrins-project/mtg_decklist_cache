By cycling through the deck quickly and efficiently, the deck aims to bring back multiple creatures from the graveyard at once, overwhelming the opponent with a sudden board presence. Additionally, the deck includes removal spells and creatures that can be cycled for value to disrupt the opponent?s game plan while setting up for the combo. The key strategy is to control the board early and then execute the Living End combo to seal the victory."
