The deck also utilizes the aggressive land strategy with cards like Arid Mesa, Bloodstained Mire, and Wooded Foothills to ensure consistent mana sources. In addition, cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish the opponent for casting spells, further contributing to the overall aggressive gameplay. Overall, the key concept of the deck is to apply constant pressure and quickly defeat the opponent."
