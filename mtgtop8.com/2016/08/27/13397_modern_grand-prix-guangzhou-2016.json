The deck aims to control the board with efficient removal like Lightning Bolt and Terminate, while generating card advantage with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Gitaxian Probe. Using efficient threats like Delver of Secrets, Young Pyromancer, and Tasigur, the Golden Fang, the deck looks to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. The deck's mana base allows for timely access to all colors needed for its spells."

By combining efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide with powerful burn spells like Lava Spike and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to pressure the opponent's life total and close out the game quickly. With a mix of direct damage spells and versatile combat tricks like Boros Charm and Atarka's Command, the deck excels at punishing slower opponents and finishing games in a swift and decisive manner."
