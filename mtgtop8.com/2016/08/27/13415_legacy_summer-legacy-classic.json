By using cards like Ponder, Brainstorm, and Cunning Wish to manipulate the deck and find key pieces, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful plays and combos. Additionally, cards like Force of Will and Pact of Negation provide protection against opposing interference, allowing the deck to execute its strategy smoothly and efficiently."
