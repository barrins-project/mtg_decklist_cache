The deck includes cantrips like Ponder and Preordain to dig for key cards, as well as protection spells like Apostle's Blessing and Dispel to keep your creatures safe. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and pump spells, finishing them off with cards like Temur Battle Rage."
