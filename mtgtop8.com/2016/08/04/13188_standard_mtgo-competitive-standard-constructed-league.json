By playing aggressive creatures like Dragon Hunter and Knight of the White Orchid along with support cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Always Watching, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on. Cards like Declaration in Stone help to disrupt the opponent's game plan while cards like Gryff's Boon provide additional evasion for the creatures. The goal is to maintain pressure and force the opponent to react, ultimately securing victory through a relentless assault."
