The deck also includes burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Fling for direct damage to the opponent. The creatures in this deck, such as Myr Enforcer and Frogmite, can be played for free or at a reduced cost due to the large number of artifacts in the deck. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle."
