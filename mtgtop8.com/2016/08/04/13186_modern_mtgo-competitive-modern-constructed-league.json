By using cheap, efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Wild Nacatl, along with pump spells like Become Immense and Temur Battle Rage, the deck aims to close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize or set up their own game plan. Thoughtseize is also included to disrupt the opponent's strategy and provide the deck with valuable information."
