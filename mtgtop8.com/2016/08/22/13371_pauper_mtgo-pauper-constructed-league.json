The goal is to eventually assemble the Urzatron lands to generate a large amount of mana, allowing for powerful spells to be cast and gaining card advantage through card draw and recursion. The deck uses a mix of counterspells, card draw, flicker effects, and efficient creatures to disrupt the opponent's game plan and gain incremental advantages until it can overwhelm them with a powerful finisher like Kaervek's Torch."
