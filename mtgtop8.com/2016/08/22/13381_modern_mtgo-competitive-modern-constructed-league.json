The deck includes a mix of evasion creatures like Blighted Agent and Glistener Elf, along with pump spells like Might of Old Krosa and Mutagenic Growth to make them lethal threats. The key strategy is to outpace the opponent's removal spells and win the game before they can stabilize. The deck aims to be fast and aggressive, securing victory through infect damage rather than traditional damage."

This aggressive strategy is supported by cards like Mutagenic Growth and Become Immense to pump up your creatures, as well as disruptive spells like Thoughtseize to disrupt your opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck includes aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Wild Nacatl to apply pressure early in the game. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's aggressive strategy."
