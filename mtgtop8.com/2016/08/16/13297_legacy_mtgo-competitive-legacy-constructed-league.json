It aims to assemble a powerful board state and then use cards like Natural Order and Green Sun's Zenith to find and play Craterhoof Behemoth for a game-ending attack. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Reclamation Sage and Scavenging Ooze to handle opposing threats. Overall, the strategy revolves around efficiently building and utilizing a large Elf army to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and explosive combo."
