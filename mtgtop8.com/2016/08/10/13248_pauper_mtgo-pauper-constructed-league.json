By utilizing cards like Chain Lightning, Lava Spike, and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to efficiently chip away at the opponent's life total. The inclusion of cards like Thermo-Alchemist and Curse of the Pierced Heart further enhances the deck's ability to consistently deal damage over the course of the game. Additionally, the deck includes some removal spells like Searing Blaze and Incinerate to help clear the way for its creatures to attack."
