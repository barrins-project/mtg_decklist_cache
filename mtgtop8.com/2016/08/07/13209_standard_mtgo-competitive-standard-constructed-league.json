The deck also includes removal spells and utility lands to control the board and keep pressure on the opponent. Liliana, the Last Hope synergizes well with the aggressive Eldrazi creatures, providing recursion and card advantage. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, powerful creatures and disrupt their game plan to secure a quick victory."
