By using cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Mother of Runes to slow down opponents while deploying threats like Knight of the Reliquary and Stoneforge Mystic to pressure them, this deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent. Green Sun's Zenith and Swords to Plowshares provide flexibility and removal options, while powerful equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte enhance the deck's combat capabilities. The mana base includes efficient lands like Wasteland and Gaea's Cradle to support the aggressive game plan."
