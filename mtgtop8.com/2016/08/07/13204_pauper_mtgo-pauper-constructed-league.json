By assembling the Urzatron lands, the deck aims to generate a significant amount of mana to cast high-impact spells such as Mnemonic Wall, Mulldrifter, and Peregrine Drake. Utilizing cards like Compulsive Research and Explore, the deck can draw additional cards and ramp up mana production. Ghostly Flicker is a key card that can be used to generate additional value by recurring powerful enter-the-battlefield abilities."
