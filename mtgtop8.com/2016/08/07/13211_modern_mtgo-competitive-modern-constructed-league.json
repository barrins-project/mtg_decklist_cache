Key cards include Arcbound Ravager to beef up creatures, Cranial Plating to boost damage output, and Steel Overseer to pump up the team. The deck is designed to be aggressive, using cheap and efficient creatures like Ornithopter and Signal Pest to apply pressure early on. The goal is to push for quick damage and secure a win before the opponent can stabilize. The deck also features some evasion with cards like Vault Skirge and Inkmoth Nexus to close out games swiftly."
