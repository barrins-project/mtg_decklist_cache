By efficiently controlling the board and disrupting your opponent's hand with discard spells, you can maintain pressure and secure victory. The deck aims to not only apply pressure with creatures like Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant, but also have answers to threats with cards like Lightning Bolt and Terminate. The use of Liliana of the Veil helps to further control the game and provide additional disruption to your opponent's strategy."
