The deck focuses on countering opponent's spells with cards such as Spellstutter Sprite and Spell Snare, as well as disrupting their plans with cards like Liliana of the Veil and Cryptic Command. The faerie creatures like Mistbind Clique and Vendilion Clique provide additional disruption and pressure on the opponent. The deck also has a strong card advantage engine with Ancestral Vision and Bitterblossom. Overall, the key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building up your own board presence."
