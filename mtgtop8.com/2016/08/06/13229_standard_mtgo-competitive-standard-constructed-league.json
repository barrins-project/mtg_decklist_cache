With a mix of creature removal, hand disruption, and card draw, the deck aims to keep the opponent's threats in check while assembling its own powerful creatures to finish the game. Liliana, the Last Hope and Sorin, Grim Nemesis provide incremental advantage, while cards like Gisela, the Broken Blade and Archangel Avacyn put pressure on the opponent. The deck's goal is to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
