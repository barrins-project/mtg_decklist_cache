The inclusion of efficient card draw spells like Ponder and Preordain helps the deck maintain consistency and find the necessary pieces to win. Ninja of the Deep Hours provides card advantage and additional pressure, while cards like Vapor Snag and Gush help in dealing with threats and gaining advantage."
