By using efficient creatures like Arcbound Ravager, Signal Pest, and Vault Skirge alongside powerful equipment like Cranial Plating, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm opponents. Steel Overseer helps to buff up the team, while Thoughtseize provides disruption to control the opponent's game plan. The deck's mana base is streamlined with a mix of lands and Mox Opal for fast and consistent ramp. Overall, the deck seeks to establish a dominant board presence early on and close out the game swiftly."
