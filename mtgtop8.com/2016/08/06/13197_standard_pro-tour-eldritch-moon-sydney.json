Additionally, it includes mana-fixing cards like Pilgrim's Eye and Nissa's Pilgrimage to ensure consistent mana production. The combination of aggressive creatures, emerge mechanics, graveyard recursion, and mana-fixing allows this deck to apply constant pressure on the opponent."

            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to establish board control through removal spells and powerful creatures like Liliana, the Last Hope and Sylvan Advocate, while also utilizing cards like Tireless Tracker and Nissa, Vastwood Seer for card advantage. The inclusion of big threats like Emrakul, the Promised End and World Breaker provide a win condition, especially when paired with Ishkanah, Grafwidow. The mana base is designed to support the Golgari colors with Hissing Quagmire and Llanowar Wastes, allowing the deck to consistently cast its spells and dominate the game."
