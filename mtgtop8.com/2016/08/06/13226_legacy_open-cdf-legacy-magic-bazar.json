The deck aims to control the game by countering opposing threats and locking the opponent out with disruptive cards. Using Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play and synergizing tribal lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to pump up the team, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy."
