The deck also includes a mix of flying and haste creatures to provide different avenues for attacking and closing out the game. Additionally, the inclusion of vehicles and powerful flyers like Archangel Avacyn offer additional threats and staying power in longer games."

It utilizes cards like Dynavolt Tower and Torrential Gearhulk to counter and remove threats while generating value through card draw and burn spells. The goal is to maintain board control while setting up for a strong finish with powerful finishers like Avacyn's Judgment and Nahiri, the Harbinger. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to the deck's colors while also supporting the powerful activated abilities of the lands."
