The deck utilizes cards like Groundswell, Vines of Vastwood, and Rancor to give its creatures additional power and trample, allowing for explosive damage output. Additionally, the deck includes some evasion with Silhana Ledgewalker and River Boa to ensure consistent damage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early in the game with a flurry of creatures and pump spells."
