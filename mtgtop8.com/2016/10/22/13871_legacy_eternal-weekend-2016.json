The deck focuses on disruption and tempo control, with cards like Delver of Secrets, Deathrite Shaman, and Young Pyromancer to apply pressure, along with countermagic like Force of Will and Daze to protect threats. The deck also includes removal in the form of Lightning Bolt and disruption through cards like Cabal Therapy. This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early on and close out the game before they can stabilize."

The deck also relies on manipulating the top of the library with cards like Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top to ensure favorable draws and potentially lock the opponent out of casting spells. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Monastery Mentor to generate card advantage and token threats to close out the game."
