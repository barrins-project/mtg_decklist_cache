The deck aims to quickly establish a board presence with cards like Lambholt Pacifist and Thalia's Lieutenant, while disrupting the opponent with Reflector Mage and Thalia, Heretic Cathar. Always Watching boosts the team's power and toughness, making it harder for the opponent to block or remove your threats. Cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Tamiyo, Field Researcher provide additional buffs and card advantage to maintain pressure on the opponent."
