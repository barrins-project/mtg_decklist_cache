By utilizing low-cost cards such as Young Wolf and Skarrgan Pit-Skulk, the deck aims to maintain a constant stream of pressure on the opponent. Utilizing cards like Rancor and Vines of Vastwood helps to enhance the power of these creatures while also providing some protection. The inclusion of cards like Mutagenic Growth and Groundswell allow for unexpected bursts of damage, while cards like Quirion Ranger and Nettle Sentinel provide additional utility and mana efficiency."
