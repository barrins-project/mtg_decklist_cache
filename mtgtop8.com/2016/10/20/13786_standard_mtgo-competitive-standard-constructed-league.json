Grim Flayer and Liliana, the Last Hope can help with card advantage and graveyard interactions, while cards like Blossoming Defense and Grasp of Darkness provide protection and removal. Traverse the Ulvenwald allows for tutor capabilities and consistency. Smuggler's Copter provides evasion and extra card draw. The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain control of the board throughout the game."
