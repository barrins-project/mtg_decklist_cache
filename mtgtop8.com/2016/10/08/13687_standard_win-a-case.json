It aims to stall the game with counterspells and removal until it can establish a winning board presence with powerful control planeswalkers like Jace, Unraveler of Secrets and Dovin Baan. The deck also features board wipes like Fumigate and Descend upon the Sinful to reset the battlefield if necessary. Overall, the deck excels at outlasting opponents through careful resource management and strategic decision-making."

By constantly pressuring your opponent with hasty creatures and direct damage, you aim to deplete their life total before they have a chance to stabilize. Cards like Furyblade Vampire and Ravenous Bloodseeker take advantage of discard effects to increase their power, while Fiery Temper and Collective Defiance provide additional reach to finish off your opponent. The inclusion of Authority of the Consuls helps to slow down aggressive opponents and gain valuable life points."
