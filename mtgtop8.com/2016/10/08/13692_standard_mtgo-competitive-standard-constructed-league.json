The deck includes cards like Smuggler's Copter and Fleetwheel Cruiser for evasion and card advantage, along with removal spells like Declaration in Stone and Harnessed Lightning to deal with opposing threats. The deck also benefits from cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Hanweir Garrison to further pump up the team and overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy."
