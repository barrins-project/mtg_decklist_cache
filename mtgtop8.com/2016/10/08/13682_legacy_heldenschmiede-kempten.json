By using cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Rishadan Port to slow down the opponent's game plan, along with powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Sword of Fire and Ice, the deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent. Additionally, the deck utilizes efficient creatures like Stoneforge Mystic and Flickerwisp to create incremental advantages and close out games quickly. The combination of disruptive elements and aggressive threats makes it a challenging deck to play against in Legacy 1 vs 1 format."
