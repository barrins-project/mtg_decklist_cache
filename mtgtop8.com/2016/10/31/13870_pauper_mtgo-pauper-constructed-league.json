The deck utilizes cards like Prophetic Prism and Ichor Wellspring to generate card advantage and mana fixing, while creatures like Atog, Carapace Forger, and Myr Enforcer can quickly overwhelm opponents. Thoughtcast allows for card draw, while Galvanic Blast provides reach and removal. The deck aims to win quickly by combining artifact synergies and aggressive plays, with the possibility of using cards like Fling for a surprise finish."

This strategy aims to overwhelm your opponent with aggressive, aura-enhanced creatures."
