By utilizing a mix of fast creatures like Toolcraft Exemplar and Veteran Motorist, combined with powerful vehicles like Fleetwheel Cruiser and Skysovereign, Consul Flagship, the deck aims to quickly deal damage and control the board. With removal spells like Decleration in Stone and Unlicensed Disintegration, along with card advantage from cards like Thraben Inspector and Geier Reach Sanitarium, this deck looks to apply constant pressure and close out games efficiently."
