The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while developing its own board presence with cards like Monastery Mentor. Key cards like Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top provide additional layers of control, allowing the pilot to manipulate the top of their library to counter spells and maintain pressure on the opponent. The deck's win condition typically involves out-valuing the opponent through efficient trade-offs and incremental advantage."

The inclusion of cards like Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger helps the deck to generate additional value and provide protection for key creatures. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and explosive board presence."
