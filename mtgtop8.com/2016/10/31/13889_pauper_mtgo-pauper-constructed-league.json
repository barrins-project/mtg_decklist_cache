The deck also includes some card draw and mana fixing to ensure a consistent flow of threats and answers. Overall, the deck is designed to be fast, aggressive, and resilient."

With card draw and filtering from cards like Mulldrifter and Preordain, the deck aims to out value and outlast its opponents, ultimately taking control of the game and winning through incremental advantage."
