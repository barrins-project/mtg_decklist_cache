The key strategy is to ramp up your mana using Eldrazi Temple and Tron lands, allowing you to drop big threats like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer early in the game. Chalice of the Void and Dismember provide disruption while cards like Spellskite offer protection for your key creatures. With a mix of powerful threats and efficient removal, this deck aims to put pressure on the opponent and close out the game before they can establish their own game plan."
