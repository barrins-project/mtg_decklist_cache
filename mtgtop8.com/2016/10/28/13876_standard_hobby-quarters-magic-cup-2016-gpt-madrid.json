Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Gisela, the Broken Blade provide additional threats, while Archangel Avacyn serves as a powerful finisher. The deck also includes removal spells like Stasis Snare and Skywhaler's Shot to deal with opposing threats. By combining aggressive creatures with disruptive spells, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory."

            "notes": "The main concept of this Golgari Control deck is to utilize a combination of removal spells, graveyard recursion, and powerful creatures to control the pace of the game. With cards like Liliana, the Last Hope, Grasp of Darkness, and Ruinous Path, the deck can deal with threats on the board while generating card advantage. Additionally, the deck focuses on using cards like Grim Flayer, Ishkanah, Grafwidow, and Emrakul, the Promised End to apply pressure and close out the game. Overall, the key strategy is to outvalue the opponent and control the game until victory."

            "notes": "The main focus of this Boros Aggro deck is to quickly establish a board presence with efficient creatures and vehicles, while using combat tricks and removal spells to push through damage and control the opponent's board. By playing powerful early game threats like Toolcraft Exemplar and Veteran Motorist, the deck can pressure the opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. Key cards like Smuggler's Copter provide card advantage and evasion, while cards like Ride Down and Fiery Temper offer removal options to clear a path for attacking."
