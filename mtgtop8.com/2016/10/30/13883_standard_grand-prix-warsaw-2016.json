Key cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, Reflector Mage, and Spell Queller allow for strong board presence and tempo swings. Cards like Thalia, Heretic Cathar and Stasis Snare help disrupt the opponent's game plan, while the inclusion of Smuggler's Copter provides additional card advantage and evasion. The deck aims to create a fast clock and overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a stable defense."
