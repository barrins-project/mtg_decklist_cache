It is essential to have efficient card selection and disruption with cards like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Cabal Therapy to ensure the combo is executed smoothly and effectively. The deck is designed to be fast and powerful, capable of winning in just a few turns."

The mana base is optimized for consistency and the deck aims to outvalue opponents with card advantage from cards like Painful Truths and Snapcaster Mage. Overall, the deck looks to tempo out opponents with a combination of disruption, pressure, and card advantage."
