The deck aims to stabilize the board with Supreme Verdict and then overwhelm the opponent with card advantage and powerful finishers like Celestial Colonnade and Sphinx's Revelation. The deck's win condition is to control the game until it can secure a dominant position and close out the game efficiently."
