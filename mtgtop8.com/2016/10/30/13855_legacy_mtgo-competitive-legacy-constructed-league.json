The deck includes tools like Crop Rotation, Sylvan Scrying, and Expedition Map to find the combo pieces efficiently. It also has disruption in the form of hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach, along with removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Ghost Quarter. The deck can grind out games with cards like Deathrite Shaman and Sylvan Library, while also having resilience with cards like Crucible of Worlds and Sylvan Library."

The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent and disrupt their game plan while setting up powerful combos and overwhelming the opponent with threats that are difficult to deal with. The strategy is to be proactive, using cards like Entomb, Reanimate, and Exhume to cheat big creatures into play ahead of schedule and win the game before the opponent can recover."
