The deck focuses on using low-cost creatures like Bomat Courier and Inventor's Apprentice to apply pressure early on, while also utilizing burn spells like Unlicensed Disintegration and Incendiary Flow to remove threats. Key to the City helps to push through damage and provide card advantage, while Smuggler's Copter and Scrapheap Scrounger provide recurring threats. Overall, the deck aims to be fast and efficient in dealing damage to the opponent."
