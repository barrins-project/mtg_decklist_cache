Cards like Falkenrath Gorger and Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet bring out powerful threats early on, while Liliana, the Last Hope provides recurring value. Unlicensed Disintegration and Fiery Temper help deal with opposing creatures, while cards like Smuggler's Copter provide additional card advantage and pressure. The deck aims to maintain a steady board presence and apply constant pressure to force the opponent into a defensive position, ultimately leading to victory through a swift and aggressive playstyle."
