By utilizing low-cost creatures and efficient pump spells, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence and apply pressure on the opponent. With the ability to pump up creatures and generate additional mana with cards like Quirion Ranger, the deck can easily surprise opponents and close out games before they have a chance to recover. The inclusion of evasion creatures like Vault Skirge and River Boa adds versatility and ensures that the deck can handle a variety of threats."
