By combining tempo plays with powerful creature abilities, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly through synergies like Nebelgast Herald's tap ability and Thalia, Heretic Cathar's tax effect. In addition, the inclusion of removal spells like Declaration in Stone and Stasis Snare helps to clear the way for efficient attacks, while cards like Archangel Avacyn and Always Watching provide additional support and resilience."
