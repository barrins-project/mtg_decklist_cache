By utilizing graveyard recursion with cards like Haunted Dead and Prized Amalgam, the deck can maintain pressure on opponents while controlling the board with Kozilek's Return. The deck's synergy allows for explosive turns and overwhelming board presence, making it a strong aggro option in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
