By discarding cards and dredging, the deck can easily bring back creatures like Prized Amalgam and Narcomoeba from the graveyard, creating a recurring army of creatures. Cards like Cathartic Reunion and Faithless Looting help to quickly fill the graveyard, while Conflagrate can deal massive damage to the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and aggressive graveyard strategy."

At the same time, the deck aims to apply pressure with aggressive creatures like Flickerwisp and Thought-Knot Seer. The use of Aether Vial allows for quick creature deployment, while Eldrazi Displacer provides additional disruption and synergy with other creatures in the deck. The combination of disruption and aggression makes it a challenging deck to face in a 1 vs 1 match."
