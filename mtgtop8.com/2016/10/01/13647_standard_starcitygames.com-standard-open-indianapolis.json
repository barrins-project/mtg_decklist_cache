The inclusion of vehicles like Smuggler's Copter adds versatility and extra damage potential. Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides additional burn and card advantage. The deck aims to close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."

It includes a mix of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to maintain control over the board. Additionally, the deck features powerful finishers in the form of Torrential Gearhulk and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar to close out the game once the opponent has been sufficiently controlled. This deck aims to outvalue the opponent and win through attrition by efficiently managing resources and disrupting the opponent's game plan."
