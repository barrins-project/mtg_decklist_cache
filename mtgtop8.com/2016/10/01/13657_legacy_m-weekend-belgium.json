It also includes disruption in the form of counterspells like Force of Will and Daze, as well as removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Abrupt Decay. Overall, the deck is focused on aggression and tempo to overwhelm the opponent."

The goal is to create a 20/20 Marit Lage token as early as possible, often by turn two or three, in order to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful threat that is difficult to deal with. The deck also includes disruption with cards like Thoughtseize and Pithing Needle to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
