By efficiently deploying threats like Toolcraft Exemplar and Bomat Courier alongside efficient removal spells such as Ride Down and Declaration in Stone, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Additionally, cards like Smuggler's Copter and Pia Nalaar provide additional versatility and reach to further solidify the deck's aggressive game plan."
