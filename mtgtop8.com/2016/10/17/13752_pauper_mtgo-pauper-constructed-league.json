The deck also focuses on drawing cards with Gitaxian Probe and cantrips like Ponder and Preordain to find the necessary pieces for both aggression and disruption. The use of bounce spells like Vapor Snag also adds to the tempo of the deck, allowing for efficient plays and maintaining board advantage."
