            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to ramp up quickly through land fetches and acceleration spells in order to assemble the Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle combo. By ramping up lands and playing cards like Knight of the Reliquary and Boom / Bust, the deck aims to reach the critical mass of lands needed to cast Scapeshift and trigger Valakut's ability to deal massive amounts of damage all at once to the opponent. The deck relies on a combination of land-based acceleration and combo pieces to quickly close out games before the opponent can respond."
