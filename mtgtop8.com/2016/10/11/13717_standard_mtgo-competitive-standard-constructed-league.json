Supporting cards like Smuggler's Copter and Fleetwheel Cruiser provide additional evasion and damage potential. Removal spells like Declaration in Stone and Harnessed Lightning help clear the opponent's threats while Skysovereign, Consul Flagship acts as a powerful finisher. The mana base is streamlined to consistently cast the aggressive creatures on curve, ensuring a fast and relentless assault on the opponent."
