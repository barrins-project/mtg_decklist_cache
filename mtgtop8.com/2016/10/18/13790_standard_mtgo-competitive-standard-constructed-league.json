The key strategy is to play aggressive early-game creatures like Electrostatic Pummeler and Longtusk Cub, then use pump spells like Larger Than Life and Built to Smash to make them bigger and deal massive damage to the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Attune with Aether and Servant of the Conduit to help fix mana and keep the aggressive plays going. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient creature attacks."
