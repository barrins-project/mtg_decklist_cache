This is achieved through a combination of counter spells, removal spells, and card filtering with cards like Counterbalance, Sensei's Divining Top, and Brainstorm. The deck aims to efficiently deal with threats on the board, while also generating card advantage through cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The win condition of the deck is usually to stabilize the board with cards like Terminus and then close out the game with powerful threats like Entreat the Angels and Monastery Mentor."
