The deck utilizes lands like Ancient Tomb and Eye of Ugin to ramp into its threats quickly, and includes cards like Simian Spirit Guide for additional acceleration. The deck also has some removal in the form of Dismember and creature enhancement in Umezawa's Jitte. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient threats."
