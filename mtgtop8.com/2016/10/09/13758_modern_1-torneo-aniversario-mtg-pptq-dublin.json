It utilizes cards like Chord of Calling and Collected Company to search for key pieces such as Melira, Sylvok Outcast, Murderous Redcap, and Fiend Hunter to create infinite damage loops or resilient board states. The deck also includes utility creatures like Selfless Spirit and Eternal Witness to provide protection and recursion. By leveraging its mana dorks and lands like Gavony Township, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver opponents through its versatile creature package."
