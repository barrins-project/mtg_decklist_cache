The key strategy is to use efficient creatures like Duskwatch Recruiter and Sylvan Advocate to pressure the opponent early, while still having access to powerful threats like Archangel Avacyn and Verdurous Gearhulk for late-game plays. The deck also includes disruptive cards like Thalia, Heretic Cathar and Transgress the Mind to disrupt the opponent's game plan, making it a versatile and competitive deck in Standard 1 vs 1 matchups."
