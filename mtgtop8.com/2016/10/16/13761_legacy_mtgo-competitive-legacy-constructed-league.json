By using cards like Maze of Ith, Wasteland, and Rishadan Port, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's development while generating value from cards like Life from the Loam and Punishing Fire. The deck also has a combo finish with Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage to quickly close out games. Overall, the deck focuses on resource denial and efficient land management to outlast and outmaneuver opponents."
