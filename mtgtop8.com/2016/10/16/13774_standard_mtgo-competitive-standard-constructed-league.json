By ramping into larger threats like Metalwork Colossus and Elder Deep-Fiend, the deck can overwhelm opponents while also maintaining card advantage with cards like Glint-Nest Crane. Additionally, the deck utilizes Improvise mechanics to cast spells more efficiently, allowing for explosive turns and difficult-to-answer threats. The Control - Improvise archetype allows the deck to maintain a strong board presence while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
