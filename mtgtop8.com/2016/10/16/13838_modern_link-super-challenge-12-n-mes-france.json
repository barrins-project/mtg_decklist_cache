By playing threats like Tarmogoyf, Grim Flayer, and Liliana of the Veil, paired with disruption from Inquisition of Kozilek and Collective Brutality, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while steadily advancing its own board state. The inclusion of cards like Lingering Souls and Scavenging Ooze provide additional value and resilience against various strategies, making it a potent Aggro deck in the Modern format."

Supporting cards like Harbinger of the Tides and Simic Charm help control the board and disrupt the opponent's plans. With a mix of tempo and tribal synergy, this Merfolk aggro deck aims to quickly build up a threatening board presence and overwhelm the opponent."

It also focuses on generating card advantage and board presence through cards like Lingering Souls and Spectral Procession. The inclusion of Geist of Saint Traft, Restoration Angel, and Drogskol Captain allows for aggressive plays and adds another layer of disruption."
