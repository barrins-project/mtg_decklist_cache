Harnessed Lightning and Fiery Temper provide additional removal and reach, while cards like Selfless Spirit and Scrapheap Scrounger provide resilience and recursion. The mana base is designed to support both white and red spells, ensuring smooth mana production for consistent aggression and pressure on the opponent."
