Selfless Spirit and Archangel Avacyn provide protection for your creatures. Declaration in Stone and Stasis Snare offer removal options, while Oath of Nissa helps with card selection and fixing your mana base. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient aggro strategy."
