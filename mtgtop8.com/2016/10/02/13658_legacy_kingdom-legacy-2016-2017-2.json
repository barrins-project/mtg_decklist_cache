It utilizes cards like Crop Rotation, Sylvan Scrying, and Expedition Map to find the combo pieces efficiently, while also running disruption like Thoughtseize and Duress to control the opponent's hand. Elvish Spirit Guide and Lotus Petal provide fast mana acceleration, allowing for a quick combo setup. Pithing Needle and Not of This World help protect the combo from removal or disruption, making it a powerful and resilient deck in Legacy 1 vs 1 format."

The deck also utilizes Show and Tell to cheat out big threats like Griselbrand and Elesh Norn. It includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Daze to protect the combo, while also having cards like Brainstorm and Careful Study for card selection and digging through the deck. The deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces and outpace the opponent with powerful reanimated creatures."
