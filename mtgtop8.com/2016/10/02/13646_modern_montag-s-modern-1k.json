The deck includes card draw, removal, and graveyard hate to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up the combo. The key strategy is to consistently cycle through cards and set up a board state where casting Living End will have a big impact on the game. The deck aims to win by overwhelming the opponent with a rapid influx of powerful creatures."
