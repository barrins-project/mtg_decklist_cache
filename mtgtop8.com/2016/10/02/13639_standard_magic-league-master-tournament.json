Cards like Smuggler's Copter and Fleetwheel Cruiser help to push damage through and provide evasion. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar can also provide a powerful anthem effect to boost your creatures. The deck focuses on maintaining pressure on the opponent and closing out games quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

By curving out with early threats like Thraben Inspector and Servant of the Conduit, followed by larger threats like Sylvan Advocate and Verdurous Gearhulk, you can quickly establish board control. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides additional creatures and pump effects, while Smuggler's Copter allows for evasion and card filtering. Declaration in Stone and Fairgrounds Warden help deal with opposing threats, while the deck aims to finish the game with a big swing from Angel of Invention or Westvale Abbey."
