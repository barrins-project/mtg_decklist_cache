            "notes": "The main concept of this Bant Aggro deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and aggressive creature strategy. By using cards like Thalia's Lieutenant to pump up your creatures and Collected Company to quickly add more threats to the board, you can apply constant pressure. Cards like Reflector Mage and Eldrazi Displacer provide disruption and tempo control, while Dromoka's Command and Ojutai's Command offer versatility in dealing with various threats. By using a mix of efficient creatures and powerful spells, this deck aims to quickly establish board presence and outpace the opponent."
