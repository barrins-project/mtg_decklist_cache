By playing cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Archangel Avacyn, along with support from Nissa, Voice of Zendikar and Sylvan Advocate, this deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board presence throughout the game. With cards like Hangarback Walker and Secure the Wastes providing additional threats, the deck can quickly build a wide board and finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."

The use of Brain in a Jar allows for the casting of instants and sorceries at an accelerated pace, while Thing in the Ice can serve as a win condition if transformed. Overall, the deck aims to outlast opponents with a combination of control and card advantage."
