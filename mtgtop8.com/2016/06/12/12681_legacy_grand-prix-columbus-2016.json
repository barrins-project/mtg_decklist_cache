The deck also aims to establish a lock with Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top to control the top of the opponent's library. Additionally, threats like Monastery Mentor and Jace, the Mind Sculptor provide win conditions while disrupting the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent in a long game."
