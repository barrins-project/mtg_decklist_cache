Thoughtcast and other card draw spells help maintain momentum, while removal like Galvanic Blast and potential finishers like Fling provide additional reach to close out the game."

The inclusion of cards like River Boa and Vault Skirge adds resilience to the deck, ensuring it can stand up against removal spells. With a low mana curve and a focus on early aggression, this Mono Green Aggro deck aims to quickly close out games and overrun opponents before they can stabilize."
