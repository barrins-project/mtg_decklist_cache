By combining powerful aggressive cards from the Selesnya colors, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and resilient army while maintaining a level of flexibility and versatility through the inclusion of utility spells and lands. The focus is on tempo, efficiency, and mid-game dominance to secure victory before the opponent can stabilize."
