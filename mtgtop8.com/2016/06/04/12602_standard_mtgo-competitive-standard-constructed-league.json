By using cards like Duskwatch Recruiter and Lambholt Pacifist to quickly fill the board with creatures, combined with Collected Company to bring out even more threats, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. Thalia's Lieutenant and Reflector Mage further enhance the deck's ability to push through damage and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of Dromoka's Command and Ojutai's Command provide additional versatility and utility in various situations."
