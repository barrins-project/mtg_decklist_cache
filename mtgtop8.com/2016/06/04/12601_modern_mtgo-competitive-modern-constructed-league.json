The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of lifegain, creature aggro, and efficient removal."

Thoughtseize helps disrupt opponents' game plans, while Mishra's Bauble and Gitaxian Probe help you draw more cards and hit your key combo pieces. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with early pressure and efficient use of resources."
