Once the board is stabilized, the deck transitions into a more aggressive strategy by utilizing evasive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Ninja of the Deep Hours to pressure the opponent's life total. The inclusion of cards like Mutagenic Growth and Snap provide additional flexibility and utility in combat situations. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while continuously applying pressure to secure the win."
