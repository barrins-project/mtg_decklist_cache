By using cards like Sneak Attack and Lotus Petal, the deck aims to quickly put pressure on the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to react. The deck also includes control elements like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Ultimately, the goal of this deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with its powerful creatures and win the game."
