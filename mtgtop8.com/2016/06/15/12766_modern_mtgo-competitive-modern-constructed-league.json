Paths to Exile provide removal, while Windbrisk Heights and Gavony Township offer additional benefits for having a wide board presence. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures and close out the game quickly."

The key strategy revolves around playing efficient and powerful creatures such as Goblin Guide, Wild Nacatl, and Burning-Tree Emissary, supported by burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Atarka's Command to control the board and push for lethal damage. By curving out with strong creatures and using pump spells like Rancor, the deck seeks to quickly close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
