The deck aims to generate card advantage and put pressure on the opponent with cards like Tireless Tracker and Collected Company. The inclusion of Dromoka's Command provides versatile removal and protection options, while cards like Knight of the White Orchid help ramp up the mana base. The deck also has a strong mana base with a mix of basic lands and dual lands to ensure consistent casting of spells."
