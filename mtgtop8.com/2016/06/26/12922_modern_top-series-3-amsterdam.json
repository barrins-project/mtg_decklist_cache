The inclusion of Emeria, the Sky Ruin allows for powerful late-game recursion of key creatures. Overall, the deck focuses on establishing a strong life total and dominating the board with a combination of aggro and control elements."

The win condition revolves around Nahiri, the Harbinger, who can search for Emrakul, the Aeons Torn to quickly finish off the opponent. The deck also includes flexible threats like Celestial Colonnade and Snapcaster Mage to apply pressure and maintain board presence. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and stabilize before closing out the game with powerful threats."
