By combining white, red, and green cards in a Naya build, the deck can effectively manage opponents' threats while building its own board presence. With key cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, Archangel Avacyn, and Dromoka's Command, this control deck aims to outlast opponents and eventually overwhelm them with a powerful end game. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to all three colors, ensuring optimal performance in a variety of situations."
