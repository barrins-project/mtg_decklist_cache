Cabal Therapy and Duress help disrupt the opponent's game plan while also providing information for Infernal Tutor. Past in Flames allows for recursion of previously used spells, and Dark Petition can tutor for key cards. The combination of efficient mana generation and card draw allows the deck to quickly assemble a lethal storm count and win the game in a single explosive turn."

The deck also aims to apply pressure with efficient threats like Tarmogoyf, Shardless Agent, and Deathrite Shaman, as well as having access to planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Jace, the Mind Sculptor for additional value and utility. The mana base is designed to support the deck's three-color requirements and disruptive land options like Wasteland."
