By playing a mix of aggressive creatures like Lambholt Pacifist and Thalia's Lieutenant, along with disruptive spells like Reflector Mage and Dromoka's Command, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent while also maintaining some form of control over the battlefield. The inclusion of cards like Tireless Tracker and Collected Company provide additional card advantage and versatility to adapt to different game situations."
