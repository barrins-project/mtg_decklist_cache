            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with a mix of powerful creatures and disruptive spells. By utilizing cards like Collected Company and Dromoka's Command, along with strong creatures like Reflector Mage and Sylvan Advocate, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain control throughout the game. The combination of mana fixing lands and card advantage engines like Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Tireless Tracker allow for a consistent flow of threats and answers, making it difficult for the opponent to keep up."
