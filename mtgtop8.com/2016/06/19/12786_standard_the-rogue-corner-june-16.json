            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to control the game with counter spells and removal, while building up resources and card advantage with draw spells such as Pore Over the Pages and Jace's Sanctum. The deck aims to stall the game until it can win with a large amount of Zombie tokens from Rise from the Tides or by taking extra turns with Part the Waterveil. The focus is on disruption and tempo, using cards like Engulf the Shore and Hydrolash to buy time and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
