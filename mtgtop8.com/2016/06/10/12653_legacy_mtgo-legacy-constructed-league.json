Green Sun's Zenith allows for tutoring key creatures, while Wasteland and Abrupt Decay provide further disruption.

            "notes": "This deck focuses on controlling the game through counterspells, card advantage, and board wipes. The key strategy is to use cards like Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top to control what spells your opponent can cast, while also utilizing cards like Force of Will and Counterspell to disrupt their game plan. The deck also includes efficient removal in Swords to Plowshares and Terminus, with card draw and filtering provided by Brainstorm and Ponder. Finishers like Snapcaster Mage, Monastery Mentor, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor help close out the game once you have gained control."
