The deck includes cards like Rite of Flame, Seething Song, and Lotus Petal to accelerate mana production, as well as Burning Wish to tutor for specific cards as needed. The goal is to assemble the necessary pieces quickly and efficiently to execute the combo and win the game."

The inclusion of creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Guide, and Eidolon of the Great Revel provides additional pressure and ensures a constant stream of damage. With a streamlined mana base and efficient spells, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."

Knight of the Reliquary provides additional utility by tutoring for key lands, while Dark Confidant and Sylvan Library allow for card advantage.

The deck also includes a mix of cantrips, counterspells, and card selection spells to help find the necessary combo pieces and protect the combo from disruption."

The inclusion of Past in Flames allows for extra recursion, ensuring that the combo can be repeated if disrupted. Overall, the deck focuses on explosive plays and comboing off as fast as possible."
