            "notes": "This deck focuses on controlling the game through a combination of removal spells, counterspells, and card advantage. It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while gradually building up towards a win condition. Nahiri, the Harbinger is the key card in this deck, allowing the player to search for Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and close out the game quickly. The removal spells and counterspells help to stall the game until Nahiri can come down and secure the victory. Additionally, Goblin Dark-Dwellers provides additional value by allowing the player to recast powerful spells from the graveyard."
