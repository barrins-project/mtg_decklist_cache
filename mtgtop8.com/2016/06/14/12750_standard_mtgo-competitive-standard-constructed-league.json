By combining efficient removal like Lightning Axe and Roast with disruptive cards like Negate and Clash of Wills, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while deploying powerful threats like Thought-Knot Seer and Hangarback Walker. The deck also utilizes mana acceleration with Traverse the Ulvenwald and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy to ramp into larger threats like Sylvan Advocate and Tireless Tracker, creating a well-rounded and adaptable aggressive strategy."
