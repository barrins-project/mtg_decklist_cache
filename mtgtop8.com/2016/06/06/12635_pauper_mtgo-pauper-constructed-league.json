The deck aims to control the game with a mix of card draw and counterspells while deploying threats to pressure the opponent. By utilizing the graveyard as a resource through cards like Thought Scour and Mental Note, the deck is able to fuel delve creatures and maintain card advantage. Ultimately, the goal is to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent with a combination of aggression and control elements."
