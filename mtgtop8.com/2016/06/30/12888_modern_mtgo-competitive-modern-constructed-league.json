The deck also runs various tutors and protection cards such as Pact of Negation and Spoils of the Vault to ensure the combo goes off smoothly. The mana base is tailored to support the combo with Lotus Bloom and Pentad Prism helping to ramp into the combo pieces. The deck aims to win the game as quickly and efficiently as possible while avoiding disruption from the opponent."
