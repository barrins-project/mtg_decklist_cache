Utilizing card draw and manipulation with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Sensei's Divining Top, the deck looks to set up powerful plays like Terminus and Counterbalance. With strong finishers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Monastery Mentor, the deck aims to take over the game once its control is established."
