            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly deploying cheap artifacts creatures onto the battlefield and equipping them with Cranial Plating to deal massive damage to the opponent. The key strategy is to maximize the efficiency of artifact creatures with cards like Springleaf Drum and Steel Overseer, while protecting them with Etched Champion and Master of Etherium. The aggro nature of the deck is amplified by cards like Galvanic Blast and Vault Skirge, making it crucial to maintain a fast pace and overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
