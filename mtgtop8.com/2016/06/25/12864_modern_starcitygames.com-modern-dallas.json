The deck also utilizes card advantage through Snapcaster Mage, Tasigur, the Golden Fang, and Vendilion Clique, allowing for multiple uses of spells and the ability to manipulate the opponent's hand. Furthermore, the deck includes a selection of cantrips and fetchlands to ensure consistent card draw and mana fixing."

The deck also aims to slow down the opponent's mana development with Leonin Arbiter and Ghost Quarter, while developing its own board presence with creatures like Flickerwisp and Blade Splicer. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben helps to further disrupt the opponent's game plan, making it difficult for them to play multiple spells in a turn. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and disruptive elements."
