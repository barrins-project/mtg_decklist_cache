The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of Allies that grow in power through various triggered abilities, such as Champion of the Parish and Thalia's Lieutenant. The deck also includes removal spells like Path to Exile and Lightning Bolt to deal with opposing threats, while Cavern of Souls helps to protect the Allies from countermagic. The deck aims to close out the game quickly through aggressive attacks and synergistic abilities."
