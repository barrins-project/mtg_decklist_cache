The goal is to maintain card advantage, protect key threats, and eventually win the game with cards like Monastery Mentor or Entreat the Angels."

The deck aims to maximize damage output with cards like Chain Lightning, Lava Spike, and Lightning Bolt. Price of Progress punishes opponents for ramping and playing nonbasic lands, and Sulfuric Vortex provides steady damage over time. The deck is straightforward and aggressive, aiming to end the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
