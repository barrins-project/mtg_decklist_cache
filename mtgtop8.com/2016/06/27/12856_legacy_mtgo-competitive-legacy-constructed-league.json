Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor provide additional versatility and card advantage. Monastery Mentor serves as a win condition and can generate a board presence quickly. The mana base is optimized for casting spells efficiently."

The deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's resources and then finish them off with powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Shardless Agent. The deck also utilizes card advantage engines like Ancestral Vision and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to maintain a strong board presence. The mana base is streamlined to ensure consistency in casting spells and disrupting the opponent's game plan."
