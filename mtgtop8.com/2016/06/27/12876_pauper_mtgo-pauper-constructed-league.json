The goal is to apply pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan with counterspells and removal. The deck utilizes card draw spells like Accumulated Knowledge and can generate additional value with cards like Mulldrifter and Deep Analysis. The mana base is designed to support the deck's two-color strategy and ensure consistency in casting its spells."
