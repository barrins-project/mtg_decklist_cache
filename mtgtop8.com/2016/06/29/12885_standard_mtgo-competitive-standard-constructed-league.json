The inclusion of Archangel Avacyn provides an additional level of protection for the creatures, while Evolutionary Leap allows for card advantage and potential creature recursion. Westvale Abbey also serves as a potential win condition in longer games."

The inclusion of Collected Company allows for explosive plays and refilling the board quickly. The deck also includes disruptive spells like Dromoka's Command to control the board and protect your creatures. Overall, the key strategy is to quickly build a powerful board presence and maintain pressure on the opponent to secure a victory."
