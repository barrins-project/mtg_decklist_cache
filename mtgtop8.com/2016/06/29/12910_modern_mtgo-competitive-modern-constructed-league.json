The deck also has some resilience with cards like Lingering Souls and Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet, and can control the board with cards like Maelstrom Pulse. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy while also providing some versatility with lands like Treetop Village and Tectonic Edge."
