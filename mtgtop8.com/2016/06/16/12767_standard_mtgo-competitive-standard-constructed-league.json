The deck aims to take advantage of cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Collected Company to pump up its creatures and keep the pressure on. The inclusion of Dromoka's Command and Reflector Mage provides additional flexibility and disruption to control the battlefield. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent access to all three colors while also maximizing the potential for efficient creature plays."
