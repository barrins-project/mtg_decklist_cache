By efficiently utilizing low-cost spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, along with creatures like Kiln Fiend and Keldon Marauders, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize. Additionally, Curse of the Pierced Heart provides a consistent source of damage each turn. This aggressive strategy is supported by the deck's mana base, which prioritizes Mountains to ensure a fast and consistent start."
