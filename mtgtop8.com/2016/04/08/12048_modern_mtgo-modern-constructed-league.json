By gaining life through cards like Soul Warden and Soul's Attendant, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures while also protecting itself with cards like Worship and Mask of Avacyn. The inclusion of cards like Genesis Chamber and Mentor of the Meek allows for card advantage and further boosting the board.

By using cards like Chord of Calling to search for specific creatures and Utopia Sprawl to ramp up mana production, the deck can quickly establish a strong board presence. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite ensures that the deck can quickly close out games once it has established control. The deck's toolbox approach allows for versatility and adaptability in different matchups."
