Thalia's Lieutenant and Hanweir Militia Captain provide incremental advantages as the game progresses, while Dragonlord Ojutai and Shaman of Forgotten Ways offer late-game power. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and maintain board presence through card advantage and disruption. The mana base is optimized for consistent colored mana sources to ensure smooth gameplay."
