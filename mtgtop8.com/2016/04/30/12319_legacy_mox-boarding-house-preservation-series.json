The mana denial package of Wasteland and Rishadan Port further slows down the opponent's game plan, while cards like Mother of Runes and Stoneforge Mystic provide protection and card advantage.

The deck utilizes powerful cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Counterbalance, and Terminus to control the gameplan and win condition, while also including cards like Entreat the Angels for a fast finish. The mana base is carefully curated to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistency in casting spells. The deck aims to outlast opponents and maintain control until it can establish a dominant position."
