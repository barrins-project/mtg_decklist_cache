The deck uses a mix of removal spells like Grasp of Darkness and Ultimate Price, along with versatile spells like Transgress the Mind and Kolaghan's Command to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Goblin Dark-Dwellers provide card advantage and recursion, while Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet provides a threat that can grow and gain value over time. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent and eventually win with powerful finishers like Chandra, Flamecaller."
