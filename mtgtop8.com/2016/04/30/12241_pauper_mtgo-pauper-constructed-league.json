The deck aims to tempo out opponents by efficiently using cheap spells like Ponder and Brainstorm to set up its powerful threats like Gurmag Angler. It also utilizes card draw and bounce spells like Compulsive Research and Vapor Snag to maintain card advantage and disrupt opponents. Overall, the deck seeks to control the game through a combination of aggression and disruption."
