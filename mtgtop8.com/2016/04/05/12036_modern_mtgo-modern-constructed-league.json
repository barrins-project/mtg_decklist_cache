The key strategy is to use mana ramping cards like Expedition Map and Urza's lands to quickly play big threats such as Reality Smasher and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. Eldrazi Temple and Eye of Ugin help to reduce the cost of casting these creatures, while Dismember and Spellskite provide protection and disruption. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with huge creatures and close out the game quickly before they can stabilize."

The inclusion of Blood Moon can also hinder opponents relying heavily on non-basic lands. Overall, this deck focuses on control elements and aggressive threats to dominate the game."
