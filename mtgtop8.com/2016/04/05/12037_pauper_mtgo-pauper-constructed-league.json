            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to put pressure on the opponent with quick, low-cost creatures like Delver of Secrets and Faerie Miscreant, while maintaining control through counterspells and bounce effects. The inclusion of Ninjas of the Deep Hours allows for card advantage and tempo swings. This deck aims to control the board through disruption and efficient card draw, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with flying creatures and evasive attacks. The combination of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells make it a versatile and powerful archetype for a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
