The goal is to outvalue the opponent by recurring spells like Mulldrifter and Chainer's Edict with Mnemonic Wall, while also having the ability to control the board with cards like Flame Slash and Electrickery. The deck aims to stabilize in the mid to late game and eventually take over with powerful spells like Rolling Thunder and Capsize. It's a slow and methodical approach to victory, grinding out wins through attrition and overwhelming resources."
