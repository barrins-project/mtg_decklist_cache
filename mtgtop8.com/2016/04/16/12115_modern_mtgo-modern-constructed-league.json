By controlling the opponent's resources and limiting their options, the deck aims to slow down their development and take advantage of the tempo swing to secure a victory. The combination of disruptive creatures like Thalia and Tidehollow Sculler, along with removal spells like Path to Exile, creates a challenging environment for the opponent to navigate. With efficient mana production from lands like Eldrazi Temple and Ghost Quarter, the deck can quickly establish a strong board presence and maintain control of the game."

By efficiently managing resources and controlling the board, the player can eventually assemble the necessary lands and cast Scapeshift to deal lethal damage with Valakut triggers. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its own win condition, ultimately outlasting the opponent and closing out the game with a powerful combo finish."
