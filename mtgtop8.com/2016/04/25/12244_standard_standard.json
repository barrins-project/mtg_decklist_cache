The mana base is constructed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent deployment of threats. The overall strategy is to maintain tempo and pressure the opponent with a mix of threats and disruption."

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and sacrifice effects using cards like Nantuko Husk and Zulaport Cutthroat to drain the opponent's life total. The deck also utilizes synergy with cards like Cryptolith Rite to accelerate mana production and Collected Company to dig for key creatures. Ultimately, the goal is to outpace the opponent and secure a swift victory."
