With a focus on grindy, attrition-based gameplay, the deck aims to keep the opponent's threats in check while generating card advantage through cards like Read the Bones and planeswalkers like Ob Nixilis Reignited and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar. The deck also utilizes tokens from Secure the Wastes and Gideon to apply pressure and close out the game."
