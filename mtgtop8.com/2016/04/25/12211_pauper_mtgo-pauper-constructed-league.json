By playing aggressive threats like Delver of Secrets and Ninja of the Deep Hours, alongside disruptive elements like Spellstutter Sprite and Counterspell, it aims to maintain a tempo advantage and disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a low mana curve and a focus on card selection and manipulation, the deck looks to quickly close out games while keeping the opponent on the back foot."
