The deck focuses on utilizing creatures like Bounding Krasis, Duskwatch Recruiter, Sylvan Advocate, and Reflector Mage to control the opponent's board and disrupt their game plan. It also includes utility cards like Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Den Protector for card advantage and recursion. Additionally, the deck utilizes Collected Company to quickly flood the board with more creatures and potentially close out games."
