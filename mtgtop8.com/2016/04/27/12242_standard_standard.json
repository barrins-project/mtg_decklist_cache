The deck aims to establish board presence early on using cards like Hangarback Walker and Thraben Inspector, while maintaining pressure with cards like Sylvan Advocate and Archangel Avacyn. The inclusion of cards like Secure the Wastes and Oath of Gideon helps to generate additional creatures, while Dromoka's Command provides both removal and support. The mana base is designed to consistently cast the powerful cards in the deck."
