            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to quickly assemble the Urza Tron lands (Urza's Mine, Urza's Power Plant, Urza's Tower) to generate massive amounts of mana. This allows the player to cast powerful colorless spells such as Ulamog's Crusher and Rolling Thunder to control the game and defeat their opponent. The deck also includes card draw and creature recursion to maintain card advantage and board presence. The goal is to overpower the opponent with efficient threats and disruption while staying ahead on resources."

The inclusion of equipment like Bonesplitter enhances the deck's aggression and gives it additional reach in closing out games."
