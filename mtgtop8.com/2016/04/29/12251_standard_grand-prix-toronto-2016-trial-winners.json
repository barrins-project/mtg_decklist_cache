Nissa, Vastwood Seer and Archangel Avacyn provide additional value and threats. Dromoka's Command allows for removal and combat tricks.

By playing a combination of creatures like Dragon Hunter, Expedition Envoy, and Kytheon, Hero of Akros, along with support cards like Gryff's Boon and Always Watching, the deck aims to quickly build up a strong board presence and push for early damage. The inclusion of cards like Declaration in Stone and Archangel Avacyn provides additional removal and protection options, ensuring that the deck can maintain its aggressive momentum."
