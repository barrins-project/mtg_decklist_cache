The deck utilizes Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top to counter spells, alongside Force of Will for additional protection. Brainstorm helps with card selection and Terminus acts as a board wipe. The deck also includes threats such as Entreat the Angels, Council's Judgment, and various creatures like Vendilion Clique and Snapcaster Mage. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and control, ultimately leading to a well-rounded control strategy in a Legacy 1 vs 1 format."
