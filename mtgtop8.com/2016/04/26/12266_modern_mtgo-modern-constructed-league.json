With strong early-game plays like Eldrazi Mimic and Endless One, combined with disruptive spells like Dismember and Thought-Knot Seer, this deck aims to apply pressure early and disrupt the opponent's game plan while building towards powerful late-game threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The inclusion of cards like Conduit of Ruin and Expedition Map help ensure consistency in assembling the necessary lands and threats for a quick and aggressive victory."
