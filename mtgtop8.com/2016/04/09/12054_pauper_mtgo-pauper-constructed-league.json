By utilizing a combination of efficient creatures like Nettle Sentinel and Skarrgan Pit-Skulk, along with powerful combat-enhancing spells like Groundswell and Rancor, the deck aims to deal quick and consistent damage to the opponent. Additionally, the inclusion of protection and evasion cards like Silhana Ledgewalker and River Boa further solidifies the deck's focus on aggressive tactics and efficient gameplay."
