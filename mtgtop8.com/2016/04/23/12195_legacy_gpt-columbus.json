The deck also includes a suite of control cards like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect the combo pieces and disrupt opponents' game plans. The deck aims to quickly assemble its combo and overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own board presence."

By utilizing cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Counterbalance, and Terminus, the player can keep their opponent's threats in check while developing their own board presence with creatures like Snapcaster Mage and Monastery Mentor. The deck aims to stabilize the game in the early turns and eventually win through overwhelming card advantage and powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels."
