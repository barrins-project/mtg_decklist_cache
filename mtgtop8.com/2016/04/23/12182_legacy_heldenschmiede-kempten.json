By utilizing a combination of burn spells and aggressive creatures, this deck aims to reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can establish control or stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Price of Progress and Sulfuric Vortex further increases the pressure on the opponent, making it difficult for them to gain life or develop their board. Overall, this deck aims to win through aggressive and direct damage rather than through traditional combat."

The win condition is to grind out the opponent with powerful threats like Monastery Mentor and Vendilion Clique while using Sensei's Divining Top, Counterbalance, and Brainstorm to ensure optimal draws and card selection."
