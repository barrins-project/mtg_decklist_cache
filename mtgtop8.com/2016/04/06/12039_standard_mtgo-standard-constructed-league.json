It also includes disruptive cards like Reflector Mage and Disdainful Stroke to control the game. The mana base is designed to support the three-color combination of white, black, and blue, allowing for flexibility in casting spells. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its aggressive plays while maintaining some control over the game."
