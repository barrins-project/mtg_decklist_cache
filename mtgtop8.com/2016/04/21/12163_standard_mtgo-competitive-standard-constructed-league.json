The deck aims to generate card advantage through cards like Read the Bones and Kolaghan's Command, and to put pressure on the opponent with powerful creatures like Mindwrack Demon and Goblin Dark-Dwellers. Chandra, Flamecaller provides additional board control and card advantage, making it hard for the opponent to catch up."
