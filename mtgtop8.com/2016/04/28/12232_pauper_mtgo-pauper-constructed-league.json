The goal is to pressure the opponent with early creatures like Delver of Secrets and Faerie Miscreant, and then close out the game with the card advantage and evasive threats provided by Ninja of the Deep Hours. The deck aims to control the game and outvalue the opponent through a combination of aggression and card advantage."
