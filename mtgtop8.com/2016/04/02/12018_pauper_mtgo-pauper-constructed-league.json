The inclusion of cards like Needle Drop and Curse of the Pierced Heart helps ensure a steady stream of damage throughout the game, allowing the deck to capitalize on its aggressive strategy."

The key strategy is to maximize damage output by playing aggressive creatures like Glint Hawk and Kor Skyfisher, while also utilizing burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt to clear the way and finish off the opponent. The deck also includes card draw and recursion to maintain momentum and outvalue the opponent. The deck aims to close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize, utilizing a mix of creatures and burn spells for maximum efficiency."

By utilizing cards like Counterspell, Chainer's Edict, and Disfigure, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining card advantage through cards like Mystical Teachings and Mulldrifter. The deck also includes cards like Ghostly Flicker and Mnemonic Wall to recur key spells and create value. The mana base is designed to provide the necessary colors to cast the spells while also including utility lands like Bojuka Bog for graveyard hate."
