The inclusion of cards like Blood Moon also adds another layer of disruption to further disrupt opponent's mana base and control the game.

The Eldrazi Mimic and Endless One provide early game pressure and the potential for explosive starts. Oblivion Sower helps disrupt the opponent's plans, while Endbringer provides utility and card advantage. The deck also includes removal spells like Dismember and Spatial Contortion, as well as board wipes like Oblivion Stone. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, high-powered Eldrazi creatures."
