Additional mana acceleration is provided by Lotus Petal and Ancient Tomb, while Sneak Attack can provide an alternative strategy to cheat creatures into play.

The goal is to control the board and prevent the opponent from executing their strategy while building up card advantage and eventually winning the game through powerful threats like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Monastery Mentor. By manipulating the top of their library with cards like Sensei's Divining Top and Counterbalance, the deck can consistently find answers to threats and maintain control of the game until they can secure a win."
