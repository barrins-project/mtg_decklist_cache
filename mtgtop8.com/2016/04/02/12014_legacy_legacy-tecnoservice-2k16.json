The key strategy is to constantly pressure the opponent's life total while also punishing them for playing non-basic lands with cards like Price of Progress. The deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize or gain too much life. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Sulfuric Vortex helps to ensure that the opponent cannot easily gain life or stabilize, allowing the deck to maintain its aggressive momentum."
