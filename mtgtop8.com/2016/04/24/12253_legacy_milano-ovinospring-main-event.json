By using cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Phyrexian Revoker to slow down the opponent, combined with aggressive creatures like Mirran Crusader and Flickerwisp, this deck can apply pressure while controlling the board. Using cards like Stoneforge Mystic and Aether Vial to cheat out equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Fire and Ice, the deck can also provide additional power and card advantage to overwhelm the opponent."
