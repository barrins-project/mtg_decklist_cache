The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a combination of early aggression, efficient creatures like Tarmogoyf and Wild Nacatl, and powerful combat tricks like Reckless Bushwhacker and Atarka's Command. The deck tries to maintain a high tempo and pressure the opponent constantly, aiming to win the game before the opponent can stabilize or set up their own game plan."

Ajani Vengeant and Gideon Jura provide additional control elements and threats, while Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek offer a win condition. The mana base is optimized for color fixing and Celestial Colonnade serves as a powerful finisher. The deck also includes disruption with cards like Remand and Spell Snare, as well as options for recursion with Academy Ruins and Crucible of Worlds."
