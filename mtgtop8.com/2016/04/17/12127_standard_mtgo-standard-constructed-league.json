The deck utilizes Collected Company to rapidly put creatures on the battlefield, while also using cards like Tireless Tracker and Sylvan Advocate to provide additional threats. Reflector Mage and Dromoka's Command help control the opponent's board, allowing the player to maintain pressure. Overall, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence quickly and outpace the opponent's defenses to secure victory."
