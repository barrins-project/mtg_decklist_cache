By protecting their creatures from removal spells and buffing them with various auras, the player aims to overwhelm their opponent with a fast and hard-hitting offense. The deck also includes some utility spells to help fix mana and deal with opposing threats. Overall, the key strategy is to create a strong, evasive threat that is difficult for the opponent to deal with efficiently."
