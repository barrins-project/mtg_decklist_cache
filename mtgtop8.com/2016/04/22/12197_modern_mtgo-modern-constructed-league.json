Gifts Ungiven helps find key cards while Path to Exile deals with opposing threats. The deck also has a strong recursion engine with Crucible of Worlds and Academy Ruins, along with the Thopter Foundry and Sword of the Meek combo for token generation. Overall, the strategy revolves around out-valuing opponents and slowing down the game until the powerful win conditions can take over."
