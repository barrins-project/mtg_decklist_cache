By utilizing a low mana curve and a high number of direct damage spells, this deck aims to reduce the opponent's life total as fast as possible. The inclusion of cards like Curse of the Pierced Heart and Searing Blaze adds extra pressure and ensures that the opponent is constantly on the back foot. With a strong emphasis on direct damage and efficient removal, this deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."
