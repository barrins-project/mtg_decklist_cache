Sensei's Divining Top and Brainstorm provide card selection and manipulation, while Terminus and Swords to Plowshares handle threats on the battlefield. The deck also includes win conditions in Entreat the Angels and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, with Snapcaster Mage providing additional value by recasting key spells from the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and secure victory through patient gameplay and strategic decision-making."

Cantrips like Ponder and Brainstorm help filter through the deck to find combo pieces, while disruption cards like Cabal Therapy and Duress help protect the combo. The deck can quickly assemble the necessary cards to storm off and win the game in a single explosive turn."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up its win conditions in the form of Entreat the Angels and Council's Judgment. By using cards like Counterbalance and Brainstorm to manipulate the top of their library, the player can consistently answer threats and ensure their own powerful spells resolve."
