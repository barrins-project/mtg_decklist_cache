The deck aims to be aggressive by utilizing cards like Reality Smasher and Drowner of Hope to deal heavy damage quickly. The inclusion of cards like Path to Exile and Stubborn Denial helps to maintain tempo and protect the deck's game plan. The mana base is designed to support the Eldrazi creatures, ensuring they can be cast consistently and efficiently."
