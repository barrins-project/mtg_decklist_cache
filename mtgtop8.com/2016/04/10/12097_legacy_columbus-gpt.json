By utilizing cards like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to pump up the team, alongside disruptive cards like Cursecatcher and True-Name Nemesis, the deck aims to establish early board presence and maintain control through counterspells like Force of Will and Daze. Cavern of Souls helps to ensure creature spells can't be countered, while Aether Vial allows for quick deployment of creatures. Chalice of the Void and Umezawa's Jitte offer additional disruption and power, making the deck a formidable force in the Legacy format."
