With a low mana curve and a focus on aggressive creatures like Skarrgan Pit-Skulk and Nest Invader, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to set up their own strategy. The use of evasion creatures like Silhana Ledgewalker and River Boa helps to ensure that the opponent's blockers are ineffective, allowing for consistent damage output. Ultimately, the goal is to win the game through a combination of speed and efficient combat tricks."
