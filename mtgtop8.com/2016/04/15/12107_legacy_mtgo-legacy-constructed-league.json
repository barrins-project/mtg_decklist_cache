The deck revolves around chaining spells together to create explosive turns, overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of Elves and pumping them up to deal massive amounts of damage in one big attack. The key strategy is to carefully manage resources and timing to maximize the effectiveness of the combo pieces and win the game quickly."
