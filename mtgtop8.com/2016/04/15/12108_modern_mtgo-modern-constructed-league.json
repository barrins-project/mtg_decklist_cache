The deck also utilizes cards like Vines of Vastwood and Ghor-Clan Rampager to protect and enhance its creatures, while cards like Experiment One and Burning-Tree Emissary provide additional value and support for the aggressive strategy."

The land base includes Inkmoth Nexus to provide an alternate win condition and Pendelhaven to pump up your infect creatures."
