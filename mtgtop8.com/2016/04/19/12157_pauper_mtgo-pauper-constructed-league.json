The deck focuses on generating card advantage through cards like Sign in Blood and Phyrexian Rager, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with Duress and Chittering Rats. The deck takes advantage of powerful finishers like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Gurmag Angler to close out the game quickly. This mono black aggro deck aims to control the board and pressure the opponent to secure a victory."
