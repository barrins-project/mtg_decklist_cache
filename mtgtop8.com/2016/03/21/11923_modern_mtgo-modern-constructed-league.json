The deck utilizes mana acceleration from Eldrazi Temple and Urza's lands to cast its high-cost spells more efficiently. Overall, the key strategy is to flood the board with Eldrazi creatures and control the game with disruptive spells while maintaining a steady flow of threats."

The Faeries creatures like Mistbind Clique and Spellstutter Sprite provide additional disruption and tempo advantage. Cryptic Command offers versatile control options, while Bitterblossom generates a steady stream of Faeries for pressure. The mana base is designed to support both Faeries and control spells, with Mutavault and Creeping Tar Pit providing additional creature threats. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through a combination of disruption, control, and threats."
