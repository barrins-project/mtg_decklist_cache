            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to aggressively lower your own life total to strengthen Death's Shadow while using aggressive creatures like Kiln Fiend and Gurmag Angler to quickly close out the game. The deck also includes spells like Temur Battle Rage and Mutagenic Growth to give your creatures additional power and evasion. Stubborn Denial helps protect your threats while disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Dismember disrupt your opponent's game plan. The deck has a low mana curve and utilizes cantrips like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to ensure you have the cards you need to win."
