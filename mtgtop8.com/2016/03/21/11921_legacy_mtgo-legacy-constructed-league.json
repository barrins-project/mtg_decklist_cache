The deck includes various tutors like Crop Rotation and Sylvan Scrying to find the combo pieces efficiently, while also running disruption in the form of hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Duress to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to quickly assemble the combo and overwhelm the opponent with a powerful threat that is difficult to deal with."
