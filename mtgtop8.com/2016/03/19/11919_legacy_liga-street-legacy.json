It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of direct damage while utilizing cards like Price of Progress and Sulfuric Vortex to maximize damage output. The low land count allows for a faster clock, while the mix of creatures and burn spells ensures a consistent spread of damage throughout the game. The strategy is to maintain pressure and force the opponent to react defensively, ultimately leading to a swift victory."
