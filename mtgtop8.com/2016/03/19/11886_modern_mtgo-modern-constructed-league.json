The inclusion of cards like Dispatch and Galvanic Blast also provides additional ways to control the board and remove threats. Overall, the deck aims to win the game quickly through consistent pressure and efficient use of resources."

The goal is to deal damage to the opponent as quickly as possible, utilizing cards like Vexing Devil, Monastery Swiftspear, and Goblin Guide to maintain pressure. Ensnaring Bridge and Anger of the Gods help to control the board and keep the opponent's creatures at bay, while Shrine of Burning Rage acts as a potent finisher. The deck's strategy relies on maintaining a fast tempo and staying ahead in the race to deal damage."
