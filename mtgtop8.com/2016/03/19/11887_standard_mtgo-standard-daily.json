It also includes removal spells like Murderous Cut and Dromoka's Command to control the board and protect its own creatures. The mana base is optimized for consistency and includes a mix of fetchlands and dual lands to ensure the deck can cast its spells on curve. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats and disruption."
