            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to use Death's Shadow as a powerful threat that grows in size based on the player's life total. By aggressively using life as a resource through cards like Gitaxian Probe and Street Wraith, the deck aims to quickly get Death's Shadow on the battlefield as a massive creature. Additional cards like Temur Battle Rage and Mutagenic Growth can be used to pump up Death's Shadow and quickly take out the opponent. This aggro strategy is supported by disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Stubborn Denial to control the game and protect the key threats."
