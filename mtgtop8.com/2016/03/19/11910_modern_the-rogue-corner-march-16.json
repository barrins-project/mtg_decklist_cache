The main goal is to repeatedly dredge through the deck with cards like Life from the Loam and Golgari Grave-Troll to fill the graveyard with creatures like Bloodghast and Squee, Goblin Nabob. This enables the deck to generate a steady stream of tokens with Zombie Infestation and Lingering Souls, while also utilizing cards like Vengeful Pharaoh and Conflagrate to control the board and disrupt opponents. The graveyard is a crucial resource that this deck exploits to its fullest potential."
