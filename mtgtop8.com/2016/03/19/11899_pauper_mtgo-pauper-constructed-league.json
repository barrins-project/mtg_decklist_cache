By playing efficient creatures like Foundry Street Denizen and Mogg War Marshal, alongside powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Goblin Bushwhacker and Intimidator Initiate enables the player to keep the pressure on the opponent and end the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."

Overall, the key concept of this deck is to maintain a balance between aggression and control to outpace and disrupt the opponent."
