The creatures in the deck are typically high power and toughness, making them difficult for the opponent to deal with once they hit the battlefield. The deck also includes cards that disrupt the opponent's graveyard, such as Faerie Macabre, to prevent them from interfering with the combo. The mana base is designed to efficiently support casting the cascade spells and Living End."
