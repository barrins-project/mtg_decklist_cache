The ultimate goal is to play Scapeshift to put multiple Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle onto the battlefield, triggering their ability to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent in one turn. Primeval Titan can also fetch Valakut or lands to further accelerate the combo. The deck's win condition relies heavily on assembling Valakut and triggering its ability multiple times in one turn."

Cards like Pithing Needle and Abrupt Decay also help in shutting down key threats and disrupting the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of Mox Opal and Ancient Stirrings helps in speeding up the deck and finding the necessary pieces to execute its game plan effectively."
