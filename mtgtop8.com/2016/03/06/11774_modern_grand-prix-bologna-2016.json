            "notes": "This deck focuses on using cycling creatures to quickly fill up the graveyard and then casting Living End to bring them all back into play for a devastating combo turn. The key idea is to cycle through your deck as quickly as possible while controlling the board with removal spells and disruption until you are ready to unleash your powerful combo. By carefully managing your resources and timing your Living End casts, you can overwhelm your opponent with a sudden burst of powerful creatures and close out the game before they have a chance to recover."
