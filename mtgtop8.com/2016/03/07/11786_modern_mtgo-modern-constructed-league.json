The key strategy revolves around boosting the power and toughness of creatures like Vault Skirge, Signal Pest, and Steel Overseer using cards like Cranial Plating and Arcbound Ravager. By playing aggressively and efficiently utilizing artifacts such as Springleaf Drum and Mox Opal, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful assault. With a mix of creatures and artifacts, this deck can quickly establish a dominant board presence and secure a victory."

Surgical Extraction and Abrupt Decay help disrupt the opponent's game plan even further, while cards like Ghoulcaller's Bell and Pithing Needle provide additional control options."
