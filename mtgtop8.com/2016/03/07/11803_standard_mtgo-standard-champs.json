            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to aggressively control the board and deal damage quickly using a mix of powerful creatures and burn spells. The deck focuses on playing efficient threats like Mantis Rider and Thunderbreak Regent while disrupting the opponent with cards like Reflector Mage. The inclusion of cards like Jeskai Charm and Draconic Roar allows for versatile removal and additional reach to finish off the opponent. By combining these elements, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory through a combination of creature damage and burn spells."
