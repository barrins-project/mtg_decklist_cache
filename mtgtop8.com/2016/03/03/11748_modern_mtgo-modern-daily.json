By utilizing powerful mana acceleration cards like Eye of Ugin and Eldrazi Temple, the deck can quickly deploy its threats and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to respond. With a mix of high-powered creatures and removal spells, the deck's strategy is to apply constant pressure and force the opponent on the back foot, ultimately leading to victory in the early to mid-game."
