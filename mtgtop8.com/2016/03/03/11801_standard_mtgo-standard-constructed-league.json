It relies on quickly building a board presence with cards like Dragon Fodder and Hordeling Outburst, while using Atarka's Command for additional reach and damage. The inclusion of cards like Abbot of Keral Keep and Monastery Swiftspear ensures that the deck can maintain pressure throughout the game. Overall, the deck looks to play quickly and decisively, aiming to end the game before the opponent can stabilize."
