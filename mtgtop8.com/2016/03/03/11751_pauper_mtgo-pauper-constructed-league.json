            "notes": "This deck focuses on controlling the opponent's board while maintaining aggression with efficient creatures like Spire Golem and Ninja of the Deep Hours. By utilizing cheap counterspells like Force Spike and Counterspell, as well as bounce spells like Vapor Snag, the deck can disrupt the opponent's game plan while developing its own board presence. The inclusion of card draw spells like Gush, Preordain, and Ponder helps to ensure consistent draws and keep the pressure on the opponent. With a focus on tempo and efficiency, this deck aims to outmaneuver and outpace its opponents in the early to mid-game stages."
