The deck includes threats like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Gideon Jura to close out the game once control has been established. Spreading Seas disrupts the opponent's mana base, while Celestial Colonnade provides a win condition. The deck aims to stabilize the board, answer threats, and grind out a victory through incremental advantage. It leans heavily on decision-making and resource management to come out on top in a longer game."
