Tainted Strike and Temur Battle Rage can provide explosive finishers, with Kiln Fiend and Gurmag Angler providing additional threats. Street Wraith and Gitaxian Probe help to dig through the deck quickly, while Mutagenic Growth can provide a surprise boost in power. Overall, the deck aims to be fast and disruptive, aiming to overwhelm the opponent before they can react."

By utilizing cards like Pyromancer Ascension and Visions of Beyond, the deck aims to set up its combo pieces quickly and efficiently. Additionally, the deck includes disruption in the form of Remand and Path to Exile to control the opponent's game plan. This combo-centric strategy allows the deck to consistently combo off and win the game in a quick fashion."
