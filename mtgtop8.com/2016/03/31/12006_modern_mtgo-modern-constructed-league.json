The deck utilizes cantrips like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to dig for key cards and maximize efficiency. Temur Battle Rage allows for explosive turns with double strike and trample, while Gurmag Angler provides a late-game threat. The mana base is flexible to support the deck's reliance on black mana and fetch lands for thinning the deck."
