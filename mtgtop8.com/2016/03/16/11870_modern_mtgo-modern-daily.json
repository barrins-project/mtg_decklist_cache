It utilizes Eldrazi Temple and Eye of Ugin to ramp up mana and play large threats like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher. The deck also includes disruptive cards like Path to Exile and Dismember to control the board, while Eldrazi Displacer and Drowner of Hope provide additional synergy and utility. By using a combination of efficient creatures and disruptive spells, this Eldrazi Aggro deck aims to quickly defeat opponents in Modern 1 vs 1 matches."
