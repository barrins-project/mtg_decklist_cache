            "notes": "The main goal of this deck is to control the board through countering opponent's spells and removing threats while ramping up lands using cards like Farseek and Search for Tomorrow. The deck aims to reach seven lands as quickly as possible to cast Scapeshift, sacrificing lands to put Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle into play to deal massive damage to the opponent. It also has card advantage tools like Snapcaster Mage and Cryptic Command to outvalue the opponent. Ultimately, the key concept is to assemble the combo of Valakut and Scapeshift to win the game."
