The deck includes a variety of versatile spells such as Dig Through Time and Duress to adapt to different matchups, while also having board wipes like Languish and Crux of Fate to deal with wide boards. Jace, Vryn's Prodigy helps with card selection and graveyard recursion to maintain control throughout the game."
