            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively play Eldrazi creatures and disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent while utilizing cards like Chalice of the Void and Spellskite to control the board. The mana base includes powerful lands such as Eldrazi Temple and Eye of Ugin to quickly ramp into powerful threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. Additionally, the deck includes utility lands like Ghost Quarter to disrupt the opponent's mana base."
