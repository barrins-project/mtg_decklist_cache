The inclusion of cards like Utopia Sprawl and Abundant Growth help ramp up mana production, allowing for multiple auras to be played in a single turn. The strategy is to aggresively build up a board presence and quickly finish off the opponent."

The key strategy revolves around generating large amounts of mana with cards like Priest of Titania and Birchlore Rangers, while leveraging the synergy between elves with Timberwatch Elf and Lys Alana Huntmaster to increase their power and create a lethal board presence. The inclusion of Distant Melody helps to refuel the hand after overcommitting resources, ensuring a consistent stream of threats against the opponent."
