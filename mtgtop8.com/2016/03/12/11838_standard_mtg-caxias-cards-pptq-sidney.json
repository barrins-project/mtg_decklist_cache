Utilizing cards like Hardened Scales and Dromoka's Command to pump up your creatures, along with mana ramp from Servant of the Scale and Nissa, Voice of Zendikar, the deck aims to create a threatening board state that can quickly close out the game. With a mix of resilient threats like Hangarback Walker and efficient beaters like Managorger Hydra, this deck aims to attack fast and relentlessly."
