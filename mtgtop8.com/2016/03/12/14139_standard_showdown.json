The deck also focuses on card draw and filtering through cards quickly. By using a combination of control spells and efficient creature removal, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and close out the game with its high-impact threats. The deck's synergy lies in its ability to improvise and adapt to different situations, making it a versatile and adaptable control deck."
