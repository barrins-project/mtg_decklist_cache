By combining efficient creature spells like Goblin Piledriver and Goblin Chieftain with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Goblin Grenade, the deck can quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. Cards like Reckless Bushwhacker and Legion Loyalist provide additional support by boosting the goblins' effectiveness and making them harder to block. With a low mana curve and a high density of threats, this deck aims to win the game within a few turns by pressuring the opponent relentlessly."
