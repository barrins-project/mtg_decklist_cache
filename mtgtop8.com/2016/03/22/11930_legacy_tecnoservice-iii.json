It relies on a combination of aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Guide, and Eidolon of the Great Revel, as well as burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning. The deck is designed to apply constant pressure by dealing damage through burn spells and creatures, while also disrupting the opponent's mana base with Price of Progress. The inclusion of Sulfuric Vortex helps to further apply pressure and limit the opponent's lifegain options."
