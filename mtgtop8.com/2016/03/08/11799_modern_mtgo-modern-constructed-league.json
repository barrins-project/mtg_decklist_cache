The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a sudden influx of powerful creatures while also disrupting their strategy with cards like Beast Within and Fulminator Mage. The deck also includes Faerie Macabre and Ingot Chewer to interact with the opponent's graveyard and artifacts, respectively. The mana base is designed to support the deck's strategy while also providing flexibility in casting spells."

Additionally, Glittering Wish acts as a versatile toolbox card, allowing for additional combo pieces or answers to specific threats."
