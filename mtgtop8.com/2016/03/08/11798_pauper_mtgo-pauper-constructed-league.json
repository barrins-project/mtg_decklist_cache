This Mono Green Aggro deck focuses on playing creatures like Nettle Sentinel, Skarrgan Pit-Skulk, and Young Wolf alongside powerful pump spells like Groundswell, Vines of Vastwood, and Rancor to increase the damage output. The deck also includes some utility creatures like Quirion Ranger and Silhana Ledgewalker for additional support. The goal is to establish a strong board presence early on and maintain pressure throughout the game."
