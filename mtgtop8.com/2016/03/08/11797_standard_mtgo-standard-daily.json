Cards like Monastery Swiftspear, Stormchaser Mage, and Abbot of Keral Keep can deal damage quickly, while spells like Slip Through Space and Temur Battle Rage can help push through damage and finish off opponents. The deck also includes disruptive spells like Roast and Kolaghan's Command to clear the way for attacks. Overall, the key strategy is to be fast and relentless in order to win before the opponent can stabilize."
