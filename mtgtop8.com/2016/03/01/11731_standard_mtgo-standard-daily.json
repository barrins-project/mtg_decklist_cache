By using cards like Collected Company to put creatures into play at instant speed and cards like Reflector Mage to bounce opposing threats, this deck aims to control the board while still pushing damage through with aggression. With a mix of powerful creatures like Warden of the First Tree and synergistic cards like Dromoka's Command, this deck looks to overwhelm opponents and secure victories through efficient play and strong creature presence."
