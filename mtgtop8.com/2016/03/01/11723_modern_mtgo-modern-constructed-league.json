The key strategy is to create infinite life with the Spike Feeder and Archangel of Thune combo, while protecting against disruption with cards like Spellskite. With Melira, Sylvok Outcast and Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit in the mix, the deck is also able to shut down opponent's strategies that rely on +1/+1 counters. The deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent through its creature interactions."
