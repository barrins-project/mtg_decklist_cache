The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with bounce spells like Vapor Snag and efficient counterspells like Force Spike, while also digging for key cards with cantrips like Preordain and Ponder. The strategy is to stay ahead on board presence and card advantage to outmaneuver the opponent and secure a victory."
