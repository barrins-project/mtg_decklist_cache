The deck aims to constantly pressure the opponent and dictate the pace of the game through card advantage and efficient threats, utilizing cards like Ancestral Vision for card draw and Jace, the Mind Sculptor for additional control. The deck is designed to be versatile and adaptable to different matchups, making it a strong contender in a Legacy format."
