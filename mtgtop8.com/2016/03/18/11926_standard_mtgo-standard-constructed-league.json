The mana base includes lands that can produce colorless mana to cast Eldrazi creatures and has a balance of utility lands for card draw and buffs. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive Eldrazi creatures and efficient plays."

By sacrificing and recurring these creatures with cards like Nantuko Husk and Ayli, Eternal Pilgrim, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent with a devastating swarm of creatures and drain them out of the game."
