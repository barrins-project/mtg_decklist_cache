            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by using the Urzatron lands to generate large amounts of mana, allowing for big plays such as casting Ulamog's Crusher or overwhelming the opponent with Rolling Thunder. The deck also includes card draw and filtering with Mulldrifter and Ancient Stirrings, as well as removal spells like Chainer's Edict and Flame Slash. The focus is on ramping up quickly to outpace the opponent and secure victory through powerful spells and board control."
