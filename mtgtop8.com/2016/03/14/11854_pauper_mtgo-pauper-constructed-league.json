It includes a variety of low-cost and efficient creatures like Mogg War Marshal, Goblin Sledder, and Foundry Street Denizen, along with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast. The goal is to apply constant pressure on the opponent and finish the game before they have a chance to stabilize or set up their own game plan. The deck aims to win through fast and efficient aggression, taking advantage of its speed and explosive damage potential."
