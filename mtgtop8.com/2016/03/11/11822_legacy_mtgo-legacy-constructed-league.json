Bridge from Below and Lion's Eye Diamond are key combo pieces that can generate an overwhelming board presence, while Cabal Therapy and Dread Return provide additional control and finisher options. The strategy focuses on exploiting the graveyard to create a powerful, synergistic engine that overwhelms opponents with a barrage of creatures and triggers."
