Additionally, cards like Galvanic Blast and Atog provide reach and potential for explosive finishes. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and efficient Aggro strategy centered around the Affinity mechanic."

The inclusion of card draw spells like Think Twice and Sea Gate Oracle helps ensure the deck maintains its resources and finds the necessary answers to deal with threats. Additionally, the deck features a single win condition in Curse of the Bloody Tome, which can grind the opponent out of the game by milling their library."
