The goal is to play big threats like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. It also includes disruptive elements like Pithing Needle and Warping Wail to control the board. The deck can also recur important pieces with cards like Crucible of Worlds and Trading Post. Ultimately, the key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats and mana advantage while disrupting their game plan."
