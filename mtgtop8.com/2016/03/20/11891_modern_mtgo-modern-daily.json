It includes a mix of low-cost creatures like Eldrazi Mimic and Endless One, as well as powerful threats like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer. The deck also includes disruption through cards like Dismember and Lightning Bolt to deal with opposing threats. The mana base is optimized to support casting Eldrazi creatures efficiently, with lands like Eldrazi Temple and Eye of Ugin. Overall, the strategy revolves around playing efficient Eldrazi creatures and putting pressure on the opponent."
