This allows you to deny them resources and key cards, while also locking them out of attacking with Ensnaring Bridge. The deck also utilizes hand disruption spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize to further disrupt your opponent's strategy. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Ghirapur Aether Grid and Pyrite Spellbomb for additional removal and win conditions."
