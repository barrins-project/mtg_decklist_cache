By ramping up with Eldrazi Temple and the Urza Tron lands, it aims to play out powerful threats like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer early in the game. With a mix of disruptive creatures and removal spells like Dismember, the deck aims to disrupt opponents while maintaining a fast and aggressive pace. The inclusion of Eldrazi Mimic and Endless One allows for explosive starts, while the top end of the curve features powerful finishers like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger."
