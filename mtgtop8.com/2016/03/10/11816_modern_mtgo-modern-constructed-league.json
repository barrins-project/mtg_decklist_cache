This combo can be set up by cycling creatures like Architects of Will and Monstrous Carabid, as well as utilizing cards like Faerie Macabre and Jungle Weaver. The deck also incorporates disruption with cards like Fulminator Mage and Beast Within to control the board and ensure the combo goes off successfully."
