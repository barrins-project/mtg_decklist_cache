It aims to control the game by using cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Phyrexian Revoker to slow down opponents, while utilizing Stoneforge Mystic to search for powerful equipment like Batterskull and Sword of Fire and Ice. The deck also includes removal spells like Swords to Plowshares to deal with threats. By combining disruption, aggression, and control, this deck aims to disrupt opponents' game plan and win through efficient creature beats."
