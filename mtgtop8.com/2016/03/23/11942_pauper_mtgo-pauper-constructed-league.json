The key strategy is to flood the board with cheap creatures like Goblin Bushwhacker and Mogg War Marshal, while utilizing cards like Goblin Sledder to pump and protect the team. The goal is to maintain pressure and deal damage as efficiently as possible, ultimately leading to a quick victory before the opponent can stabilize their board."
