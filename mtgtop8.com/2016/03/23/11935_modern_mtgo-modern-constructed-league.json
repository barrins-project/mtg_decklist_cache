Key cards like Become Immense and Vines of Vastwood help to deliver lethal blows, while utility spells like Gitaxian Probe and Apostle's Blessing provide additional protection and card advantage. The flexibility of the deck allows for fast, explosive wins that can catch opponents off guard and secure victories before they can react."
