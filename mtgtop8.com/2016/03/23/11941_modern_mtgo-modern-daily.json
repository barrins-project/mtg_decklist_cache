            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly generate mana and flood the board with Elves in order to overwhelm the opponent with the sheer number of creatures. With cards like Heritage Druid and Elvish Archdruid, the deck can generate a lot of mana early on, allowing for quick plays and explosive turns. Collected Company and Lead the Stampede help to refill the hand and keep the board full of threats. Ezuri, Renegade Leader provides a powerful finisher, while Shaman of the Pack can drain the opponent's life total quickly. The key strategy is to swarm the board with Elves and overrun the opponent before they can stabilize."
