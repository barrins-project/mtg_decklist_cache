By playing multiple creatures early on and reinforcing them with pump spells like Groundswell and Mutagenic Growth, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Many of the creatures in the deck have evasion abilities or hexproof, making it difficult for the opponent to block or remove them from play. The Mono Green Aggro archetype focuses on building a strong board presence and consistently applying pressure to the opponent."

By utilizing cards like Wild Nacatl, Squadron Hawk, and Matca Rioters, alongside removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Chainer's Edict, the deck can establish board control and deal damage rapidly. The mana base is optimized with cards like Terramorphic Expanse and Nylea's Presence to ensure consistency in casting spells. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and maintain aggression throughout the game to secure victory."
