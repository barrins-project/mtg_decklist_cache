Cards like Sire of Insanity and Iona, Shield of Emeria can lock opponents out of the game while powerhouse creatures like Griselbrand can provide card advantage and pressure. This deck aims to execute its game plan efficiently and disrupt opponent's strategy with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Unmask."
