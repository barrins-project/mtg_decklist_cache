By utilizing cards like Counterbalance, Sensei's Divining Top, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, the deck aims to control the opponent's plays while setting up its own win conditions. The inclusion of powerful spells like Force of Will, Swords to Plowshares, and Terminus help to maintain board control, while cards like Snapcaster Mage and Monastery Mentor provide additional value and pressure on the opponent. Ultimately, the deck focuses on outlasting the opponent and winning through incremental advantage."
