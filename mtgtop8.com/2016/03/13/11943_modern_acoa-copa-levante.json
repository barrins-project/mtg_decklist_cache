The deck focuses on playing high-impact Eldrazi creatures, such as Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer, as early as possible using mana acceleration from cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Eldrazi Temple. The deck also utilizes disruption tools like Chalice of the Void and Dismember to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and apply constant pressure to its opponent."
