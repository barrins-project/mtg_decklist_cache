Avatar of the Resolute and Managorger Hydra benefit from +1/+1 counters, while Hangarback Walker provides additional threat and resilience. The deck aims to outpace the opponent and swarm them with powerful creatures before they have a chance to stabilize."

The deck also aims to generate card advantage and maintain flexibility through cards like Collected Company and Den Protector. The land base is designed to provide consistent mana sources and ensure the deck's curve is efficient. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a stream of threats while controlling the battlefield."
