The deck aims to control the board with countermagic and removal spells while applying pressure with efficient creatures. The mana base is optimized for consistent access to the deck's main colors, red and green, and includes powerful utility lands like Wasteland. Overall, the deck combines aggression and disruption to establish dominance in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
