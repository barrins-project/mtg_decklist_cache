The deck utilizes evasive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Ninja of the Deep Hours to chip away at the opponent's life total. Spellstutter Sprite and Faerie Miscreant provide disruption in the form of cheap counterspells and card advantage. The deck aims to control the board with cheap removal spells like Vapor Snag and tempo plays, while also being able to apply pressure with efficient creatures."
