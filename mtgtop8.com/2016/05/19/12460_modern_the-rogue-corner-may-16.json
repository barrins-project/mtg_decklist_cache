            "notes": "The deck focuses on maintaining control of the game by countering opponent's spells, disrupting their strategy, and gaining card advantage. It uses a combination of counterspells, creatures with flash, and land destruction to disrupt opponents' plans. The win condition is to slowly take over the opponent's creatures with Vedalken Shackles and finish them off with powerful control spells like Cryptic Command. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent through efficient use of resources and limited interaction."
