Using disruptive spells like Daze and Force of Will, the deck looks to control the game and protect its creatures. Chalice of the Void is used to shut down opposing spells, while Cavern of Souls ensures the Merfolk spells can't be countered. Aether Vial helps to cheat creatures into play, providing a steady stream of threats. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and aggressive Merfolk swarm."
