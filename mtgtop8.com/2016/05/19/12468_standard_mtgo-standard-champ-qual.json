This strategy is supported by cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Thalia's Lieutenant to buff up the weenies and make them more threatening. The deck also includes removal spells like Declaration in Stone to deal with opposing threats. The goal is to establish early board presence, pump up the creatures, and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to recover."
