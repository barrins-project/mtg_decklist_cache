By playing creatures like Knight of the White Orchid and Thraben Inspector, you can consistently hit your land drops and keep the pressure on your opponent. Collected Company allows you to dig for more creatures and Thalia's Lieutenant pumps up your team, making your creatures even more threatening. Overall, this deck aims to be proactive and aggressive, putting your opponent on the back foot from the start."

The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of small creatures while disrupting their game plan with cards like Declaration in Stone and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar. The inclusion of Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides a strong finisher option to close out the game. Overall, this deck aims to be aggressive and proactive, pressuring the opponent early and often."
