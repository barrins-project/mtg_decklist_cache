This mana can then be used to cast powerful spells like Cryptic Command and Whispers of the Muse multiple times in a single turn. The deck also includes strong creatures like Tarmogoyf and Snapcaster Mage to control the board and finish off the opponent. The key strategy is to set up the infinite mana combo and overwhelm the opponent with card advantage and powerful spells."

By using cards like Chord of Calling and Nahiri, the Harbinger, the deck can tutor for specific creatures like Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker and Deceiver Exarch to create an infinite combo. The toolbox approach allows for flexibility in responding to different situations, with cards like Aven Mindcensor and Fulminator Mage disrupting opponents while Eternal Witness and Reveillark provide recursion. The deck aims to control the board while setting up its game-winning combos."

By using cards like Scapeshift and Primeval Titan, the goal is to deal massive amounts of damage by triggering Valakut multiple times in one turn, ultimately overwhelming the opponent's life total and winning the game in a single explosive turn. The deck also includes some control elements like Anger of the Gods to deal with aggressive opponents."
