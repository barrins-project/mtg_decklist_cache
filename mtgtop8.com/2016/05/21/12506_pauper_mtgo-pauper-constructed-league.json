            "notes": "The main concept of this Pauper aggro deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with low-cost, evasive creatures like Gladecover Scout and Slippery Bogle, and then pump them up with powerful Aura spells like Armadillo Cloak and Ethereal Armor. The deck also makes use of cards like Abundant Growth and Nylea's Presence to fix mana and draw cards to maintain its aggression. By efficiently utilizing a combination of creatures and auras, this deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and close out the game quickly."
