By playing low-cost creatures like Foundry Street Denizen and Legion Loyalist early on, and then using cards like Reckless Bushwhacker and Goblin Chieftain to boost their power and attack, the goal is to deal massive damage to the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. With burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Goblin Grenade as finishers, this deck aims to win the game through pure aggression and speed."
