The deck aims to apply pressure early on with fast threats and disruption, backed up by versatile removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Abrupt Decay. The mana base includes dual lands for consistency and access to all three colors, while also running efficient cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder for card selection and advantage."
