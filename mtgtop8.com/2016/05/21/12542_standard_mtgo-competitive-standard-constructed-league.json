The deck has a strong midrange plan with cards like Tireless Tracker and Nissa, allowing it to grind out opponents over the course of a game. The mana base is built to support the three-color strategy, with a mix of dual lands and fetch lands to ensure consistent access to all colors. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue opponents and control the game until it can secure a win condition."
