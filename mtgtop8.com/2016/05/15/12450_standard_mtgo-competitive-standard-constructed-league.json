The deck looks to maintain a steady board presence and pressure the opponent with early creature drops like Town Gossipmonger and Thraben Inspector, while also utilizing powerful planeswalkers like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar for additional threats. The inclusion of removal spells like Declaration in Stone helps to clear the way for attacks and keep control of the battlefield."
