By cycling through the deck with cards like Faithless Looting and Careful Study, the player can quickly bring back powerful creatures like Golgari Grave-Troll and Ichorid from the graveyard to overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Lion's Eye Diamond and Cabal Therapy add additional layers of strategy and disruption to the combo-centric gameplay. Overall, this deck focuses on graveyard manipulation and recursion to overwhelm the opponent with an explosive combo."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with counterspells like Force of Will and removal spells like Swords to Plowshares, while also utilizing powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Nahiri, the Harbinger for additional value. The inclusion of Emrakul, the Aeons Torn as a win condition adds an extra dimension to the control strategy."
