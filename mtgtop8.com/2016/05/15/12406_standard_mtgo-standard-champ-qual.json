            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to flood the battlefield with low-cost, efficient white creatures and bolster them with cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Always Watching. By overwhelming the opponent with a constant stream of weenies, backed up by strong anthem effects, the deck aims to quickly build a formidable board presence and pressure the opponent's life total. The inclusion of removal spells like Declaration in Stone helps ensure that the opponent's defenses are broken down, allowing for a smooth path to victory through relentless aggression."
