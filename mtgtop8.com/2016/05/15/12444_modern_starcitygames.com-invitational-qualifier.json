The goal is to then use Angel's Grace to prevent losing the game from drawing out and win either by casting Lightning Storm or by having Laboratory Maniac on the field. The inclusion of cards like Phyrexian Unlife and Pact of Negation helps to protect the player while they assemble their combo. The deck is designed to be explosive and win the game in a single turn."

The deck also has a mix of burn spells for reach and removal, making it versatile in dealing with a variety of threats. The mana base is designed to support the control elements and ensure consistent casting of both colored spells and Nahiri's ultimatum."
