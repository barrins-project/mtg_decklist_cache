The inclusion of powerful anthem effects and efficient removal spells further supports the aggressive game plan, allowing the deck to stay ahead and close out games before the opponent can recover."

Through careful resource management and disruption with cards like Transgress the Mind, the deck aims to outlast and outplay the opponent until it can secure the win condition with spells like Secure the Wastes or Westvale Abbey."
