This allows the player to cast powerful spells such as Rolling Thunder or Capsize multiple times in a turn, overwhelming the opponent with a combination of removal, card advantage, and powerful finishers. By controlling the game early on and ramping up mana production, the deck aims to take over the game in the mid to late stages."

Thoughtcast and Prophetic Prism help with card draw and fixing mana, while burn spells like Galvanic Blast and Fling can close out the game or remove threats. This deck relies on a combination of efficient creatures and artifacts to overwhelm opponents quickly and efficiently."
