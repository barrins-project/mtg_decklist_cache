Archangel Avacyn provides protection and a strong finisher. Dromoka's Command and Oath of Nissa help control the board and ensure consistency, while Westvale Abbey offers a powerful win condition. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with an aggressive strategy that utilizes efficient creatures and powerful planeswalkers."
