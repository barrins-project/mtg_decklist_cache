            "notes": "This deck focuses on early aggression with low-cost creatures like Delver of Secrets and Cloudfin Raptor, but also incorporates card advantage and tempo plays with Ninja of the Deep Hours and bounce effects like Dream Stalker and Snap. Counterspells like Counterspell and Force Spike help protect your creatures and keep the opponent off-balance. The deck aims to control the board while maintaining pressure, utilizing cards like Ponder and Preordain to maintain consistency and filter through the deck. The inclusion of Spire Golem provides a strong late-game threat to close out the game."
