The deck utilizes powerful Merfolk lords such as Master of the Pearl Trident and Lord of Atlantis to pump up the team, while disruptive creatures like Harbinger of the Tides and Tidebinder Mage help control the battlefield. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for efficient deployment of creatures, and cards like Spreading Seas provide additional disruption and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain tempo to secure a victory."

This allows the player to play powerful threats such as Karn Liberated, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The deck also includes disruption elements like Spellskite and Oblivion Stone to control the opponent's board, while Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying help to find the pieces needed to establish UrzaTron efficiently. Lightning Bolt provides additional removal and reach to close out the game."
