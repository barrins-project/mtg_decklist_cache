The inclusion of anthem effects like Always Watching and Thalia's Lieutenant, along with efficient creatures like Town Gossipmonger and Thalia's Lieutenant, allows for a fast and relentless assault on the opponent. Additionally, cards like Declaration in Stone provide removal options and disruption to control the board and maintain pressure. The deck aims to establish board presence quickly and maintain pressure throughout the game."
