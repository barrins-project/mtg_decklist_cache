By using cards like Cryptic Command, Snapcaster Mage, and Sphinx's Revelation, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent while disrupting their game plan with cards like Negate and Path to Exile. The deck also utilizes planeswalkers like Ajani Vengeant and win conditions like Celestial Colonnade and Dragonlord Ojutai to close out the game once control has been established. The mana base supports the deck's strategy by providing the necessary colors and fixing with cards like Flooded Strand and Celestial Colonnade."
