By utilizing cards like Lava Spike, Boros Charm, and Lightning Bolt, along with creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. Additionally, cards like Atarka's Command and Searing Blaze help to keep the pressure on the opponent while also managing the board state. This deck prioritizes speed and direct damage to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
