            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to flood the board with cheap and efficient white creatures, buffing them with anthem effects like Thalia's Lieutenant and Always Watching. By quickly building a wide presence early in the game, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive attacks and gradually chip away at their life total. Removal spells like Declaration in Stone help clear the way for your creatures while enabling Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit to provide counter support. The deck's low mana curve ensures a fast and consistent start to pressure the opponent from the beginning."
