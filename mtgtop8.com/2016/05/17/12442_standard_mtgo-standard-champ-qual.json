The goal is to overwhelm the opponent early on with a barrage of cheap but powerful creatures, backed up by cards that give them additional abilities or protection. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides additional support and can help create a wide board presence. The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent and quickly close out the game."
