It aims to utilize cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Snapcaster Mage, and Monastery Mentor to generate card advantage and create threats. The deck also includes a variety of countermagic and disruption spells like Force of Will and Council's Judgment to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also utilizes the combination of Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top to control the top of the opponent's library and counter their spells effectively. The mana base is designed to support the deck's powerful spells and allow for consistent casting of spells."

Using cards like Hymn to Tourach and Abrupt Decay to control the game, along with disruptive countermagic like Force of Will and Daze, the deck aims to keep the opponent off balance. The creatures in the deck, such as Tarmogoyf, True-Name Nemesis, and Delver of Secrets, provide a clock for the opponent to deal with. The deck also utilizes Life from the Loam to grind out value and keep the mana flowing with dual lands and Wasteland."
