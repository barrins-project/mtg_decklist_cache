It also includes disruptive cards like Duress and Distress to control the opponent's hand, while also protecting your creatures with Spellskite and Apostle's Blessing. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and disruption, finishing off the game with massive Eldrazi like Ulamog and Emrakul. With a mix of aggression and disruption, this deck aims to dominate the board and control the game."
