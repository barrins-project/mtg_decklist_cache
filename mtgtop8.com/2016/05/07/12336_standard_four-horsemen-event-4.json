By constantly pressuring the opponent early in the game with small but efficient creatures, backed up by removal like Stasis Snare and Declaration in Stone, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The addition of cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit helps to further boost the team's power and resilience, creating a fast and relentless aggro strategy."
