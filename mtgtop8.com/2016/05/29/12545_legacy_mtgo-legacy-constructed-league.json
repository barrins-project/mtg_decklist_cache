By using disruptive spells like Force of Will, Hymn to Tourach, and Abrupt Decay, along with mana denial from Wasteland, the deck aims to control the game early on. Additionally, the deck utilizes powerful card advantage engines like Ancestral Vision and Shardless Agent to keep the pressure on the opponent. The creatures in the deck, such as Tarmogoyf, Deathrite Shaman, and Baleful Strix, provide a fast clock and additional value. The planeswalkers, Liliana of the Veil and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, serve as powerful finishers and control tools."
