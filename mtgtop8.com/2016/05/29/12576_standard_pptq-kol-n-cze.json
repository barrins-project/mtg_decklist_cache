The key strategy is to establish early board presence with low-cost creatures like Hangarback Walker and Sylvan Advocate, then power up with anthem effects from Nissa and Gideon. The deck also includes resilient threats like Den Protector and Archangel Avacyn to ensure staying power. With a well-balanced mix of creatures, removal, and planeswalkers, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and aggressive playstyle."
