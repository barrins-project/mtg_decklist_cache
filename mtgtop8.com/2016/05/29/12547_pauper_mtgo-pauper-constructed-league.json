The strategy is to maintain control of the board through efficient removal and disruption while steadily chipping away at the opponent's life total. With a strong curve of low-cost creatures and powerful finishers like Gray Merchant of Asphodel, the deck aims to close out games before the opponent can stabilize. Key cards like Chainer's Edict and Phyrexian Rager provide card advantage and disruption to keep the pressure on the opponent."
