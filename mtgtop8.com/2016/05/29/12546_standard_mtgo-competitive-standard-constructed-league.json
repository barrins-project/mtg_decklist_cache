By using a combination of removal spells, hand disruption, and powerful planeswalkers, the deck aims to control the game until it can close it out with a strong finisher like Secure the Wastes or Westvale Abbey. The deck prioritizes playing defensively and making efficient use of its resources to outlast and outmaneuver its opponent."
