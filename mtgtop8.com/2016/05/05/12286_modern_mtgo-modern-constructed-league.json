This allows the player to cast powerful colorless spells such as Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and various Eldrazi creatures. The deck also includes cards like Spellskite and Oblivion Stone to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. By efficiently ramping up mana and controlling the game, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and establish dominance in the late game."

The mana base is streamlined for consistency, allowing the deck to deploy threats efficiently and close out games before the opponent can stabilize."
