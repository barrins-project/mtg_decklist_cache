By using cards like Gladecover Scout and Slippery Bogle, the deck aims to create a fast and aggressive board presence. The auras like Armadillo Cloak and Ethereal Armor boost the creatures' power significantly, making them difficult to deal with. The deck also includes cards like Journey to Nowhere for removal and Abundant Growth for card draw and mana fixing. Overall, the strategy of this deck is to create a strong, evasive threat early in the game and capitalize on it."
