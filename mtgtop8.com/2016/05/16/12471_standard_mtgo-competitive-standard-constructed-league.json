It focuses on playing creatures with strong abilities and tempo plays to quickly overwhelm the opponent. The deck aims to generate card advantage and board presence through cards like Collected Company, Tireless Tracker, Sylvan Advocate, and Reflector Mage. It also includes some control elements with Dromoka's Command and Archangel Avacyn to protect its board and disrupt the opponent's strategies. Overall, the key idea is to put constant pressure on the opponent while maintaining card advantage and control."
