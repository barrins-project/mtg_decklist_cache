By utilizing cards like Duskwatch Recruiter and Lambholt Pacifist to establish an early advantage, and Thalia's Lieutenant to pump up the team, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent while maintaining card advantage with cards like Thraben Inspector and Tireless Tracker. The deck also includes disruptive spells like Reflector Mage and Dromoka's Command to control the board and protect its creatures."
