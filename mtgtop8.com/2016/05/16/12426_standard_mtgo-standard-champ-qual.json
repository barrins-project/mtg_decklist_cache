Collected Company is used to generate additional creatures, while Reflector Mage provides tempo advantage by bouncing opponent creatures. Dromoka's Command and Ojutai's Command offer versatility in dealing with threats and supporting the aggro strategy. With a mix of creatures, spells, and lands that provide multiple colors of mana, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with early aggression and efficient combat tricks."
