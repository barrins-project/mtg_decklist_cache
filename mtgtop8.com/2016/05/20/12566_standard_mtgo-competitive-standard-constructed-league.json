By quickly building a board presence with cards like Dragon Hunter, Knight of the White Orchid, and Thalia's Lieutenant, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Cards like Always Watching and Gryff's Boon provide additional buffs to strengthen the army of white creatures. Declaration in Stone is included for removal, while Archangel of Tithes and Stasis Snare offer control options. The deck's goal is to win through a combination of early aggression and creature synergy."
