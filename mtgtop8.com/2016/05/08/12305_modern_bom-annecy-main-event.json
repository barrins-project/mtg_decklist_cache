The inclusion of cards like Scavenging Ooze and Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet helps to gain incremental advantage and disrupt graveyard strategies.

The key combo involves playing Scapeshift to fetch Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and a large number of Mountains to deal massive damage to the opponent. Prismatic Omen helps ensure all of your lands count as Mountains for Valakut's ability. Primeval Titan can search for key lands and trigger Valakut's damage ability multiple times. This deck aims to win by overwhelming the opponent with massive direct damage."
