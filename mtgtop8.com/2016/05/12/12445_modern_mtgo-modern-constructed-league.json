The deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total, using burn spells and combat damage to finish them off. The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Atarka's Command adds extra damage potential and disruption to control the pace of the game. The mana base is optimized for consistency and efficient spell casting."
