By combining creatures with hexproof and abilities that make them difficult to target, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with large, hard-to-remove threats. The deck includes cards that both search for auras and ramp up mana production, allowing for explosive turns where multiple auras can be played at once. The goal is to create a fast and aggressive board presence that can quickly close out the game."

This allows for powerful late-game plays such as casting Rolling Thunder or Mulldrifter multiple times in a turn. The deck also includes a selection of utility lands and spells to ensure consistency in both mana production and card advantage. By efficiently managing resources and disrupting opponents, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents in the long game."
