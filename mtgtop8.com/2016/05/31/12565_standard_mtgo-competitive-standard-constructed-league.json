By using mana acceleration with cards like Hedron Crawler and Knight of the White Orchid, as well as land destruction with Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while establishing a strong board presence. Cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Secure the Wastes provide additional support and ways to close out games, making it a fast-paced and formidable Aggro deck."
