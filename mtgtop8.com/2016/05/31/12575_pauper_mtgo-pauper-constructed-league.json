It also includes card advantage and recursion to outvalue opponents. The key strategy is to reach a critical mass of mana to cast powerful threats like Mulldrifter and Rolling Thunder, while disrupting the opponent's game plan with removal and counters. The deck aims to grind out the opponent with efficient answers and card advantage, ultimately overwhelming them with its late-game threats and mana advantage."
