The deck utilizes cards like Ethereal Armor, Armadillo Cloak, and Ancestral Mask to rapidly increase the power and toughness of the creatures, while also providing additional benefits such as lifelink and card draw. By attaching multiple auras to a single creature, the deck can overwhelm the opponent and close out games quickly before they have a chance to stabilize."
