By utilizing cards like Reflector Mage and Thalia's Lieutenant to control the board and pump up your creatures, you can apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game. Collected Company provides additional creature advantage, while Dromoka's Command and Ojutai's Command offer versatile utility to handle different situations. This deck focuses on tempo and aggression, aiming to quickly build a threatening board presence and outpace the opponent's strategy."
