The key strategy involves using Life from the Loam to continuously recurr lands from the graveyard and generate card advantage. Additionally, the deck can assemble the Dark Depths/Thespian's Stage combo to quickly create a 20/20 indestructible creature. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through efficient land-based control."

By using disruptive cards like Chalice of the Void and Thorn of Amethyst to control the opponent's spells, along with versatile cards like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher to apply pressure, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of utility cards like Umezawa's Jitte and Dismember provide additional versatility and options in different matchups."
