By using cards like Rishadan Port, Wasteland, and Punishing Fire, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's strategy while setting up a powerful combo with Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage. Life from the Loam provides card advantage and helps to recur key lands, while cards like Gamble and Crop Rotation help to find necessary pieces for the combo. The deck focuses on resource denial and efficient land-based strategies to dominate the game."
