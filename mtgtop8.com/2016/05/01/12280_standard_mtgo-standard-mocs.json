The deck can also surprise opponents with the flash ability of Stratus Dancer and Archangel Avacyn. Collected Company allows for additional creature plays, and Dromoka's Command and Ojutai's Command provide versatility in dealing with threats. The mana base allows for consistent casting of spells and creatures."
