Declaration in Stone helps deal with any troublesome creatures on the opponent's side, while cards like Stasis Snare provide additional removal options. The deck also utilizes Oath of Nissa and Evolutionary Leap to fix mana and find key pieces when needed."

By consistently disrupting their plans and clearing their threats from the board, you can slowly build up your own resources and eventually take over the game with powerful planeswalkers like Nahiri, the Harbinger and Chandra, Flamecaller. The deck thrives on creating a back-and-forth battle of attrition until you can secure a definitive advantage and close out the game."
