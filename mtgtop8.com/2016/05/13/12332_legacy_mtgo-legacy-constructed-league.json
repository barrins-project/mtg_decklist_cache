            "notes": "The main focus of this UWx Control deck is to maintain control of the game through powerful card advantage, counterspells, and removal. By utilizing cards like Counterbalance, Sensei's Divining Top, and Snapcaster Mage, the deck aims to outvalue opponents by efficiently answering threats and manipulating the top of their library. With powerful finishers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Monastery Mentor, the deck can effectively close out games once it has stabilized. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize consistency."
