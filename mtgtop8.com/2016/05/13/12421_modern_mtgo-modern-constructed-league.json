This allows for triggering Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle multiple times in one turn, dealing direct damage to the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods for removal and control. Overall, the goal is to combo off and deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent in a short amount of time."

The creatures in the deck are also aggressive, with haste or abilities that allow them to deal damage quickly. The land base is built to support the low curve of the deck, allowing for consistent early aggression. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast, relentless assault of burn spells and aggressive creatures to close out the game quickly."

Meanwhile, Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Flickerwisp provide additional disruption and tempo plays, while the Eldrazi creatures offer powerful threats. The deck's strategy revolves around controlling the game while applying pressure to quickly close out the game."
