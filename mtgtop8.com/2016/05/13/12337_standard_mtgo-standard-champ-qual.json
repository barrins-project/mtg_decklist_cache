The deck aims to maintain a fast pace and apply pressure with efficient creatures like Abbot of Keral Keep and Hangarback Walker, supported by Thopter Engineer and Pia and Kiran Nalaar for additional value. The inclusion of Warping Wail provides versatility in dealing with threats, while cards like Westvale Abbey and Foundry of the Consuls offer a late-game plan if needed."
