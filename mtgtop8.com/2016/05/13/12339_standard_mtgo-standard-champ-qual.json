It also includes removal spells like Anguished Unmaking and Grasp of Darkness to deal with threats efficiently. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with hand disruption spells like Transgress the Mind and Hallowed Moonlight, while also generating a board presence with Secure the Wastes and Archangel Avacyn. The mana base provides a good balance of colored sources to cast spells consistently."
