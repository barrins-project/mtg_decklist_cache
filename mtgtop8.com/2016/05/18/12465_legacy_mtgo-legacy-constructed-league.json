The deck utilizes a combination of powerful planeswalkers, versatile removal spells, and disruptive cards like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's three-color combination and to maximize consistency. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early on and maintain control of the game until victory is achieved."

The deck also includes disruptive elements like Daze, Force of Will, and Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own threats. Additionally, the mana denial provided by Wasteland and disruption from cards like Gitaxian Probe and Brainstorm help ensure the deck can maintain its tempo and control the pace of the game."
