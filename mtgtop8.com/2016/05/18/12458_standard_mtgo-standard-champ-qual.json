            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly building up a strong board presence of small, efficient creatures and pumping them up with anthem effects like Always Watching and Thalia's Lieutenant. By playing aggressively and overwhelming the opponent with a swarm of weenie white creatures, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of removal spells like Declaration in Stone helps to clear the way for attacks and keep the opponent on the back foot."
