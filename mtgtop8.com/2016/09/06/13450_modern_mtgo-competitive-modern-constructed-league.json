By utilizing cards like Ghost Quarter and Leonin Arbiter, you can slow down your opponent's game plan while deploying creatures like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Thought-Knot Seer to disrupt their hand and board. Eldrazi Displacer also provides versatility in both offense and defense by blinking your creatures. Overall, this deck aims to control the game through disruptive plays while maintaining a strong aggressive presence on the battlefield."
