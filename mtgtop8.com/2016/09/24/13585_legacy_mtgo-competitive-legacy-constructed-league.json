Interaction is provided through counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce, along with powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The mana base includes fast lands like Ancient Tomb and City of Traitors, as well as dual lands like Volcanic Island to support the combo strategy."

By utilizing cards like Shardless Agent, Cavern Harpy, and Parasitic Strix, players can continuously trigger Aluren's ability to generate value and overwhelm their opponent. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Abrupt Decay and Force of Will to protect the combo and control the board, while also utilizing card selection with Ponder and Brainstorm to find key pieces."
