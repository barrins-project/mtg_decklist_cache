By generating a large amount of mana, the player can use Genesis Wave to put a significant portion of their deck onto the battlefield, including powerful creatures like Craterhoof Behemoth and Primeval Titan. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a massive board presence in just a single turn, potentially securing a quick victory. Additionally, cards like Primal Command and Eternal Witness provide flexibility and utility throughout the game."
