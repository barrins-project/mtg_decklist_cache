The deck focuses on generating card advantage through cards like Cryptic Command and Snapcaster Mage, while also ramping with cards like Search for Tomorrow and Sakura-Tribe Elder. The deck aims to control the board and stall the game until it can assemble its combo pieces for a game-ending Scapeshift combo."
