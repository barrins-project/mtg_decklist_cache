It also aims to ramp up mana with cards like Attune with Aether to play powerful threats like Verdurous Gearhulk. Removal spells such as Harnessed Lightning and Incendiary Flow help control the board while cards like Hanweir Garrison and Lathnu Hellion provide additional threats. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful board presence, utilizing a mix of creatures, removal, and burn spells for a strong aggro strategy."
