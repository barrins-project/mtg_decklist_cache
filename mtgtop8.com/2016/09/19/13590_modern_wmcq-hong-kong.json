Eldrazi Displacer and flicker effects are used to disrupt opponents' strategies by blinking their key permanents, while Thalia, Leonin Arbiter, and Spell Queller provide additional disruption. The deck also includes powerful creatures like Thought-Knot Seer and Geist of Saint Traft to apply pressure and close out games quickly. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize its disruptive potential."
