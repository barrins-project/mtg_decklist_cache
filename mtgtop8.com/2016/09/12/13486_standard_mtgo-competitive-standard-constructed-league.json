Collected Company allows you to dig for more creatures and potentially surprise your opponent with additional threats. Dromoka's Command provides removal and utility. The deck also includes some card draw and ramp with cards like Tamiyo, Field Researcher and Tireless Tracker. The mana base is primarily focused on white and green, with some splash of blue for additional utility."
