It utilizes Life from the Loam to recur lands, Punishing Fire to remove threats, and Knight of the Reliquary to search for key lands. Chalice of the Void and Abrupt Decay provide disruption, while Liliana of the Veil and Dark Confidant offer card advantage. The deck can also control the board with Maze of Ith and Karakas, while utilizing Grove of the Burnwillows for incremental lifegain. Overall, the deck aims to grind out the opponent and control the game through its land-based strategy."
