Dispel and Apostle's Blessing provide protection for your creatures, while cheap cantrips like Preordain and Ponder help you dig for the cards you need. Lightning Bolt offers additional removal and reach. The land base is optimized for consistency, with Evolving Wilds helping to fix mana for both colors."
