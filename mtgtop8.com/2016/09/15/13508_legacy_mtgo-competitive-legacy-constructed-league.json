By using Lords of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to boost the power of Merfolk creatures, along with disruption spells like Daze and Force of Will to control the game, the deck aims to quickly establish a board presence and close out the game with efficient attacks. Chalice of the Void is used to disrupt opposing strategies, while cards like True-Name Nemesis provide protection and evasion. The deck also includes Aether Vial for additional mana acceleration and flexibility."

The deck's main win condition comes from Knight of the Reliquary, who can search for powerful lands like Maze of Ith or Karakas, and using Punishing Fire as a recurring damage source. Overall, the deck aims to grind out the opponent through resource denial and control elements."
