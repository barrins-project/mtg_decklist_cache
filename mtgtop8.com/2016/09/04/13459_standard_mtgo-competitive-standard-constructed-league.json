It also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Liliana, the Last Hope to generate card advantage and provide additional utility. The inclusion of powerful finishers like Emrakul, the Promised End adds a threatening win condition once the game has been sufficiently controlled. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through patience and strategic resource management."

It also uses Reflector Mage and Spell Queller to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Collected Company helps to quickly put more creatures on the battlefield, while Declaration in Stone and Dromoka's Command provide removal and protection options. The mana base is well-balanced to support the aggressive playstyle of the deck. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence and efficient creature interactions."
