The goal is to disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Transgress the Mind and Ruinous Path, while building up your own board presence with a mix of dragons and efficient mana sources. The deck has a strong mid-to-late game strategy, utilizing card advantage with Read the Bones and Goblin Dark-Dwellers to outvalue the opponent and secure victory through attrition."
