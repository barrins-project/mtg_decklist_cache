Utilizing cards like Liliana, the Last Hope and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy for card advantage and removal spells like Grasp of Darkness, Ruinous Path, and Dark Salvation to control the board. The deck aims to curve out with powerful plays like Voldaren Pariah and Westvale Abbey for a quick finish, while also having options for resilience with cards like Relentless Dead and Sunken Hollow for mana fixing."
