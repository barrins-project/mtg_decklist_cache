Primeval Titan is a key card that can search for Valakut or other utility lands, while Anger of the Gods provides board control against aggressive decks. The deck aims to win through a powerful combo of Valakut triggers and lands entering the battlefield simultaneously, overwhelming the opponent with a barrage of burn damage."
