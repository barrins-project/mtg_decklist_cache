            "notes": "The main strategy of this deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures like Carnophage, Carrion Feeder, and Gray Merchant of Asphodel. The deck also focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan with removal spells like Geth's Verdict and Nameless Inversion. Tortured Existence allows for constant card advantage and Ghoulcaller's Chant helps in recurring key creatures. With a blend of creature aggression, removal, and recursion, this deck aims to outpace and outvalue the opponent in a fast-paced Pauper 1 vs 1 game."
