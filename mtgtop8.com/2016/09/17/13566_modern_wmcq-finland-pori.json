This deck focuses on graveyard synergy and recursive creatures to outvalue opponents and win through attrition and overwhelming board presence."

Once you have enough mana, you can cast Living End to bring back all the creatures you cycled through, overwhelming your opponent with a strong board presence. The deck also includes removal spells like Deadshot Minotaur and Beast Within to deal with any threats your opponent may have."
