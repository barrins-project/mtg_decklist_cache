The key idea is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy, utilizing cards that synergize well with artifacts and can easily be cast early in the game. The deck also includes removal spells like Galvanic Blast for clearing the way for attacks while maintaining a strong board presence with cards like Steel Overseer and Etched Champion. Overall, the strategy revolves around using the high synergy between artifacts and creatures to create a powerful and fast-paced aggro strategy."

By playing cards like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Guide, and Eidolon of the Great Revel alongside burn spells such as Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Lava Spike, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The mana base is designed to support this fast-paced strategy, with a focus on fetching lands that can provide the necessary colors for casting spells early in the game."
