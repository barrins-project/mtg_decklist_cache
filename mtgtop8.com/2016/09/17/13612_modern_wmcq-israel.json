By constantly dredging cards from the library into the graveyard, the deck can quickly assemble a board presence and overwhelm the opponent with an aggressive combo strategy. Through cards like Tormenting Voice, Faithless Looting, and Life from the Loam, the deck can quickly dig through the graveyard to find the necessary pieces to execute its powerful combo plays and secure a victory."
