Kytheon and other aggressive creatures like Dragon Hunter and Reckless Bushwhacker provide early pressure, while Declaration in Stone helps to remove any threats from the opposing board. The mana base is optimized for a fast and consistent start, utilizing Needle Spires for additional damage potential. Overall, the goal is to maintain a steady stream of aggressive threats to outpace the opponent and secure a swift victory."
