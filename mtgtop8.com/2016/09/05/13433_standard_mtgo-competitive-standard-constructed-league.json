By utilizing cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Reflector Mage, along with the ability to search for more creatures with Collected Company, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence and push for damage quickly. Cards like Duskwatch Recruiter and Tireless Tracker provide card advantage and resilience, while Tamiyo, Field Researcher offers additional utility. The mana base is built to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent casting of spells."
