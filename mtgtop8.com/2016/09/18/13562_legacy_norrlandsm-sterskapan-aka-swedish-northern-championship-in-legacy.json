By using cards like Delver of Secrets, Young Pyromancer, and Gurmag Angler, along with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Dismember, this deck aims to close out games quickly by attacking the opponent's life total. Additionally, the inclusion of disruption spells like Force of Will and Cabal Therapy allows the deck to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own threats. Overall, this deck focuses on being aggressive and applying consistent pressure to secure victory."
