Eventually, the deck looks to finish the game with powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's color requirements and maximize consistency."

The deck aims to pressure the opponent early on with aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, while also utilizing efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, and Price of Progress to finish off the opponent quickly. Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Sulfuric Vortex also help to punish opponents for playing spells, making it difficult for them to stabilize and turn the game in their favor."
