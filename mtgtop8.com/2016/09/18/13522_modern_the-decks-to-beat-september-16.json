By getting multiple Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle onto the battlefield, you can deal massive amounts of damage to your opponent in one turn. The deck also includes cards like Courser of Kruphix and Oath of Nissa to help with card selection and consistency, making it a strong combo deck focused on quickly assembling the Valakut combo."
