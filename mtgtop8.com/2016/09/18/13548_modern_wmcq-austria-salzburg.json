            "notes": "The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with cards like Farseek, Search for Tomorrow, and Sakura-Tribe Elder to eventually cast Scapeshift to combo with Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle for massive damage. It also runs a suite of control spells like Cryptic Command and Remand to disrupt the opponent's strategy and protect its own combo. Bring to Light serves as versatile toolbox card, while Snapcaster Mage provides additional value by flashing back important spells from the graveyard. The deck aims to control the game early on and win with a powerful combo finish."
