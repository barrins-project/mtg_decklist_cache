By using various spells and effects to grow Death's Shadow to a massive size, the deck aims to deal significant amounts of damage in a short amount of time and overwhelm opponents. The inclusion of aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Wild Nacatl, along with pump spells like Become Immense and Temur Battle Range, helps maintain pressure on the opponent and close out games quickly. The deck's synergy and fast-paced gameplay make it a formidable force in the Modern format."

Lastly, the deck can close out games quickly with its aggressive creatures like Grim Flayer and Raging Ravine."
