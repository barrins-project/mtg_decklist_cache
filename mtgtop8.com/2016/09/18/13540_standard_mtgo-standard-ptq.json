            "notes": "This Bant Aggro deck focuses on using a variety of creatures with powerful abilities to pressure the opponent early in the game. By playing threats like Reflector Mage and Spell Queller alongside disruptive spells like Declaration in Stone, the deck aims to control the board while developing its own board presence. Cards like Collected Company and Duskwatch Recruiter provide card advantage and help maintain pressure on the opponent. The deck's mana base allows for consistent color access to cast its powerful spells while also providing flexibility in terms of land types."
