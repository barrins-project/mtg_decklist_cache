            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressive play with a mono black deck, using cards like Liliana, the Last Hope, Dark Salvation, and Grasp of Darkness to control the board and deal damage quickly. By utilizing cards like Cryptbreaker, Haunted Dead, Prized Amalgam, and Relentless Dead, the deck aims to flood the board with creatures and overwhelm the opponent. Distended Mindbender and Voldaren Pariah provide additional control and threats. The mana base includes some blue sources to support Jace, Vryn's Prodigy while still predominantly focusing on black mana."
