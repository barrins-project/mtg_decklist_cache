By consistently applying pressure to the opponent's life total, it seeks to burn through their defenses and win the game before they can stabilize. With a low mana curve and a high amount of direct damage spells, this deck aims to close out the game swiftly and overwhelm the opponent with a barrage of fiery spells and creatures."

With plenty of ways to draw cards and generate mana, this deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent while maintaining control of the game."
