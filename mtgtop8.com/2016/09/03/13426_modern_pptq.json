Cards like Prismatic Omen, Explore, and Knight of the Reliquary help ramp up the number of mountains on the battlefield, while Steppe Lynx and Plated Geopede provide early game pressure. Boom / Bust can be used to disrupt the opponent's mana base while also triggering Valakut's ability. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with sudden bursts of damage from Valakut activations."

By utilizing a combination of counterspells like Spell Snare, Mana Leak, and Logic Knot, along with removal spells like Path to Exile and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent. Drawing cards with Think Twice and Sphinx's Revelation, as well as utilizing the flexibility of Snapcaster Mage, allows the deck to maintain card advantage and stay ahead in the game. Ultimately, the goal is to stall the opponent and win through efficient control and removal spells."
