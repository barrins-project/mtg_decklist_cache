Additional card draw and selection with Ponder, Brainstorm, and Predict help ensure consistency. Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Snapcaster Mage provide added versatility and win conditions, while Monastery Mentor creates token pressure. The mana base allows for flexibility and access to a variety of spells in a traditional UWx control shell."
