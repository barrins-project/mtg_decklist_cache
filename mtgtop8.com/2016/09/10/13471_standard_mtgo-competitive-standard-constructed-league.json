By utilizing cards like Collected Company and Dromoka's Command to bring out multiple creatures quickly, along with strong creatures like Thraben Inspector, Tireless Tracker, and Thalia's Lieutenant, the deck aims to maintain board presence and apply pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Thalia, Heretic Cathar and Reflector Mage also helps disrupt the opponent's strategy, while Tamiyo, Field Researcher provides additional card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to outpace and outmuscle the opponent."
