The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to control the board and generate card advantage. Lingering Souls provides additional board presence and resilience. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's three-color requirements. Overall, this deck aims to apply early pressure, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and close out the game quickly."
