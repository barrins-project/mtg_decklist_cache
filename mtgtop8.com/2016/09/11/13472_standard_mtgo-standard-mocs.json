The deck also utilizes cards like Tireless Tracker and Collected Company to generate card advantage and maintain pressure on the opponent. Dromoka's Command serves as versatile removal and pump spell, while Tamiyo, Field Researcher provides card draw and additional utility. The mana base is designed to support the color requirements of the deck while enabling consistent plays."
