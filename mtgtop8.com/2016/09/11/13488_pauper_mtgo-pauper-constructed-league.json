Using cards like Ghostly Flicker and Archaeomancer to repeatedly abuse powerful enters-the-battlefield effects from cards like Mulldrifter and Peregrine Drake, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent until it can secure a win condition. By constantly disrupting the opponent's game plan and building incremental advantage, this deck seeks to control the tempo of the game and emerge victorious."

By utilizing hexproof and trample abilities, the deck aims to create a fast clock that is difficult for opponents to interact with. Buffing creatures with enchantments like Ancestral Mask and Armadillo Cloak allow for explosive bursts of damage, while also providing much-needed lifegain to sustain aggression. The mana base is designed to maximize the consistency of casting creatures and auras, ensuring the deck operates smoothly and efficiently."
