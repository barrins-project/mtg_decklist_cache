The deck also includes cards like Atarka's Command and Boros Charm to provide additional reach and ways to close out the game."

The goal is to deal a large amount of damage quickly with aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Wild Nacatl, while protecting Death's Shadow with spells like Mutagenic Growth and Become Immense. Thoughtseize helps disrupt the opponent's game plan and Tarmogoyf provides additional pressure. The mana base supports the multi-color nature of the deck to ensure consistency in casting spells."

The land base is focused on fetching and thinning the deck to maximize the effectiveness of milling cards. It is an aggressive combo deck that aims to win through deck depletion rather than traditional combat strategies."
