By utilizing a mix of creatures with strong enter-the-battlefield effects and powerful combat abilities, the deck aims to quickly establish a board presence while also being able to handle threats from the opponent. The use of Collected Company allows for additional creature deployment and Den Protector provides a form of recursion. Overall, the deck is designed to apply pressure early on and maintain control throughout the game."
