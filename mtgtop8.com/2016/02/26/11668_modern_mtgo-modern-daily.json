By utilizing cards like Eldrazi Mimic and Vile Aggregate, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on. Cards like Drowner of Hope and Reality Smasher provide additional power and disruption, while Thought-Knot Seer allows for hand disruption. The deck also includes support cards like Cavern of Souls and Eye of Ugin to help cast Eldrazi creatures more efficiently. Overall, the goal is to rapidly build up a threatening board and quickly defeat the opponent."
