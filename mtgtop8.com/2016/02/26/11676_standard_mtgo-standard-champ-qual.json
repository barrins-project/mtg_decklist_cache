These creatures are supported by spells like Titan's Strength, Temur Battle Rage, and Fiery Impulse to enhance their abilities and remove blockers. The deck also includes card draw spells like Treasure Cruise and Slip Through Space to maintain card advantage and keep the pressure on the opponent. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient creatures and spells."
