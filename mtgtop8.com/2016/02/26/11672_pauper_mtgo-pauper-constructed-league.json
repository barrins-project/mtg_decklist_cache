            "notes": "The core idea of this deck is to maintain control with counterspells while also deploying evasive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Ninja of the Deep Hours to chip away at the opponent's life total. By utilizing efficient card draw with Ponder and Preordain, along with disruption from Spellstutter Sprite, the deck aims to outpace the opponent and close out the game quickly. The inclusion of cards like Vapor Snag and Bonesplitter provides additional versatility and combat tricks to keep the pressure on the opponent."
