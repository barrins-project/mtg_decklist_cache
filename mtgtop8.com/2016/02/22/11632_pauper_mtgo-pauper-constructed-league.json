The key strategy is to flood the board with efficient threats, including Atog, Carapace Forger, Frogmite, and Myr Enforcer, while using Springleaf Drum and Prophetic Prism to accelerate mana production. Thoughtcast provides card advantage, while Galvanic Blast offers removal and reach. Fling can serve as a finisher by sacrificing a large artifact creature. The deck's land base includes artifact lands to aid in casting the affinity creatures."

By focusing on low-cost creatures with hexproof like Slippery Bogle and Silhana Ledgewalker, you can ensure that your auras stick and your creatures become unstoppable threats. With cards like Rancor, Ethereal Armor, and Armadillo Cloak, you can rapidly increase your creature's power and toughness, allowing you to deal massive damage and win the game before your opponent has a chance to respond."
