Cards like Dismember and Ruination Guide help provide removal and additional synergy with the Eldrazi creatures. Overall, the deck aims to quickly establish a dominant board presence and finish the game before the opponent can respond."

With plenty of low-cost artifacts and synergy between cards like Cranial Plating, Steel Overseer, and Arcbound Ravager, the deck can deal a significant amount of damage in a short amount of time. Additionally, cards like Thoughtcast allow for card advantage to keep the pressure on. This deck can be aggressive and difficult to deal with, especially with the potential for explosive plays using cards like Mox Opal."

The key strategy involves using mana acceleration from cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Eldrazi Temple to cast powerful threats such as Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer ahead of schedule. Chalice of the Void disrupts the opponent's game plan by shutting down spells of specific converted mana costs, while cards like Spellskite provide protection for your important creatures. This deck aims to curve out smoothly and apply pressure to win the game quickly."

Chalice of the Void and Spellskite provide disruption and protection, while Dismember offers removal. The deck also includes utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Eye of Ugin to help with mana consistency and disrupting opponents' strategies.Overall, the key concept of this deck is to play aggressive Eldrazi creatures and disrupt the opponent's game plan."

Cranial Plating serves as a powerful equipment to further boost the attacking capabilities of the creatures. Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum help to accelerate mana production. The deck also has access to direct damage with Galvanic Blast and has a strong land base with Darksteel Citadel, Blinkmoth Nexus, and Inkmoth Nexus."

By utilizing cards like Scapeshift and Through the Breach, the goal is to quickly bring out multiple Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle lands to deal lethal damage to the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Courser of Kruphix and Sakura-Tribe Elder to help with card advantage and ramping up mana. Ultimately, the key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and significant burst damage from Valakut triggers."
