By using cards like Eldrazi Mimic and Thought-Knot Seer, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining a fast clock. Cards like Chalice of the Void and Spellskite help protect the creatures and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of cards like Dismember and Spatial Contortion provide removal options when needed. The mana base is optimized to support the Eldrazi creatures, allowing for explosive starts and powerful mid-game plays."
