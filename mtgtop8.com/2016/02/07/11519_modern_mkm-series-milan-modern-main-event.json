The deck includes control elements such as counterspells and removal spells to protect the combo pieces. Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage provide card advantage and digging for combo pieces. The mana base is designed to efficiently cast the spells needed for the combo while controlling the board. The key strategy is to assemble the combo pieces and protect them until the combo can be executed for a game-winning play."
