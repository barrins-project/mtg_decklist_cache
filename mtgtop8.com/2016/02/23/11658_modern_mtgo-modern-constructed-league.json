By playing small, efficient creatures like Experiment One, Goblin Guide, and Wild Nacatl, combined with cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Reckless Bushwhacker to quickly build a board presence, this deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Atarka's Command provides additional reach and versatility, while cards like Rancor help to maximize damage output. The deck's mana base allows for consistent and fast starts, putting pressure on the opponent from the beginning of the game."
