By leveraging the affinity mechanic, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures while utilizing cards like Atog and Fling for additional burst damage. The inclusion of artifact lands and color-fixing artifacts like Chromatic Sphere and Prophetic Prism ensures smooth mana production and consistency in casting spells. Overall, the deck focuses on speed, synergy, and aggression to outpace and overpower opponents."
