The deck focuses on maximizing damage output through creature tokens generated by spells like Dragon Fodder and Hordeling Outburst, as well as utilizing pump spells like Atarka's Command and Titan's Strength. This deck aims to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent with a combination of efficient creatures and burn spells to finish the game quickly."
