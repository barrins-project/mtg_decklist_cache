            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to establish control over the game by using a combination of removal spells, board wipes, and hand disruption, while also gaining incremental value through lifegain and card advantage. The deck aims to stabilize the board with efficient removal like Crackling Doom and Fiery Impulse, protect its threats with Silkwrap and Secure the Wastes, and generate card advantage with Painful Truths. Planeswalkers like Chandra, Flamecaller and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provide additional win conditions and board presence, making it difficult for the opponent to regain control once the deck has established dominance."
