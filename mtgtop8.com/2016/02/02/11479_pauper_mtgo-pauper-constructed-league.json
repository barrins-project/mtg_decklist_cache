It also includes artifacts that draw cards or provide mana fixing to ensure consistency in gameplay. The deck includes both aggressive attackers like Glint Hawk and card advantage generators like Mulldrifter to maintain pressure on the opponent. The mana base consists of a mix of dual lands and artifact lands to support the color requirements of the deck. Overall, this deck aims to establish board presence early and maintain pressure throughout the game."
