The deck also includes cards like Fangren Marauder and Mulldrifter for card advantage and Sea Gate Oracle for deck filtering. With a mix of removal spells like Firebolt and Flame Slash, the deck aims to control the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful late-game threats."

The mana base is designed to support the artifact theme, with plenty of lands that can also double as artifacts. Overall, this deck aims to outpace opponents with a fast and efficient aggro strategy centered around affinity for artifacts."

            "notes": "The focus of this deck is to quickly flood the board with cheap artifact creatures and use cards like Thoughtcast to draw additional cards for more threats. With a high artifact count, cards like Galvanic Blast become powerful removal spells, while also being a finisher with Atog or Fling. The deck also utilizes mana fixing through artifacts like Prophetic Prism and Chromatic Star, ensuring a smooth mana curve for explosive starts. Overall, the synergy between artifacts and aggressive creatures makes this deck a potent threat in Pauper 1 vs 1 matches."
