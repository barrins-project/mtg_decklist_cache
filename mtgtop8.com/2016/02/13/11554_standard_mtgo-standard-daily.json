            "notes": "The main concept of this Red Deck Wins aggro deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with low-cost, aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Zurgo Bellstriker, while also generating extra creatures with cards like Dragon Fodder and Hordeling Outburst. These creatures are supported by combat trick cards like Titan's Strength and Become Immense to deal unexpected burst damage, with additional burn spells like Wild Slash and Fiery Impulse to finish off the opponent. The deck aims to end the game quickly by utilizing efficient creatures and spells to deal damage as fast as possible."
