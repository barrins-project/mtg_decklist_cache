            "notes": "The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with cards like Explosive Vegetation and Nissa's Pilgrimage to play big Eldrazi creatures like Ulamog and Kozilek. It also uses control elements like Thought-Knot Seer and World Breaker to disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining board presence with cards like Sylvan Advocate. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats while having answers to their threats through Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Kozilek's Return. It utilizes lands like Sanctum of Ugin and Shrine of the Forsaken Gods to further support its ramp and control strategy."
