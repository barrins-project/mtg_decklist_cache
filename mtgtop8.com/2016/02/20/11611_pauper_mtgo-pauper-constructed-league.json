The main strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures like Glint Hawk and Kor Skyfisher, while using cards like Prophetic Prism and Ichor Wellspring to draw cards and enable powerful spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt. By combining a fast and evasive creature base with a strong removal suite, this deck aims to apply constant pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan."

By utilizing cards like Rancor, Groundswell, and Mutagenic Growth, the aim is to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The deck also includes some evasion creatures like Silhana Ledgewalker and Vault Skirge to help get in damage even if the opponent has blockers. The key strategy is to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react, ultimately leading to victory through aggressive play."
