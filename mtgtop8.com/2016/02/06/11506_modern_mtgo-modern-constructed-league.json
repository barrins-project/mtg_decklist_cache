With cards like Arcbound Ravager and Cranial Plating, the deck can deal a lot of damage quickly. The goal is to use cards like Galvanic Blast and Shrapnel Blast to finish off the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. Steel Overseer provides a way to pump up the creatures, while Etched Champion and Vault Skirge provide some protection. Overall, the deck aims to win fast and decisively through aggressive attacks with a strong artifact synergy."
