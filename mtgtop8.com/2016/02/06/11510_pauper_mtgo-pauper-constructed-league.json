It also utilizes card draw and mana fixing to maintain card advantage and consistency. The inclusion of artifact creatures and artifacts serves as additional threats and utility for the deck. Overall, the deck aims to establish control early on and maintain it throughout the game, eventually securing a win through a combination of removal, card advantage, and efficient threats."
