By casting cheap cantrips and spells, the deck can trigger Jeskai Ascendancy multiple times in a turn, untapping mana creatures and generating enough mana to continue casting spells and drawing cards. Glittering Wish serves as a versatile toolbox card to search for key combo pieces, while Gitaxian Probe and Visions of Beyond help dig through the deck for combo pieces. This deck aims to assemble its combo quickly and overwhelm the opponent with card advantage and mana efficiency."
