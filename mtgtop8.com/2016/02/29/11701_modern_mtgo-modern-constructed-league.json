The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive threats while controlling the board with removal spells and disruptive creatures. By using lands like Eye of Ugin and Eldrazi Temple, the deck can cheat out high-cost creatures ahead of schedule, putting the opponent on the back foot and pressuring them to respond to the board state. Ultimately, the deck aims to close out the game quickly with its large, powerful creatures."
