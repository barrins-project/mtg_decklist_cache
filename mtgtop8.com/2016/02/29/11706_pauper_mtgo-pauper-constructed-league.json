The deck also includes some evasion in the form of Vault Skirge and River Boa to bypass blockers. Overall, the strategy is to maintain a strong board presence and apply pressure early on to quickly take down the opponent's life total."

It utilizes card draw and filtering with cards like Mulldrifter and Prophetic Prism to maintain hand advantage and find key pieces. Removal spells like Chainer's Edict and Firebolt keep the opponent's board in check, while Rolling Thunder acts as a finisher. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent by efficiently using resources and overwhelming them with powerful threats."
