With a focus on quick damage and board presence, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total before they have a chance to stabilize. Utilizing cards like Foundry Street Denizen and Mogg War Marshal, as well as burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast, the deck is designed to maintain pressure and close out the game swiftly."
