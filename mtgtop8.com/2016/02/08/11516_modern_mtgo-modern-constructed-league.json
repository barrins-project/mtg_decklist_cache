The focus is on applying early pressure with cards like Eldrazi Mimic and Reality Smasher, while disrupting the opponent's game plan with disruptive creatures like Thought-Knot Seer and Eldrazi Obligator. The deck aims to close out games quickly with powerful threats that are difficult to deal with, while also being able to adapt to different matchups with versatile sideboard options."
