Utilizing cards like Stoneforge Mystic and Swords to Plowshares, the deck has access to powerful equipment to further enhance its creatures and control the board. The mana denial strategy with Wasteland and Rishadan Port helps shut down the opponent's resources while Aether Vial provides flexibility in deploying creatures."
