This allows for powerful plays like casting Rolling Thunder or Capsize multiple times in a turn, overwhelming the opponent with efficient threats and answers. The recursion provided by Mnemonic Wall and Izzet Chronarch adds to the deck's resilience, making it difficult for opponents to gain a foothold in the game. Overall, the strategy centers around establishing dominance and grinding out a victory through resource management."
