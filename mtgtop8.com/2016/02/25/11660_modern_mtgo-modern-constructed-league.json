The combination of powerful creatures and disruption makes it a formidable aggro deck that can quickly overwhelm opponents in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."

By using cards like Demonic Dread and Violent Outburst, the player can cast Living End to bring all the cycled creatures back onto the battlefield, overwhelming the opponent with a powerful board presence. The deck also includes Fulminator Mage and Beast Within to deal with problematic lands and permanents. The goal is to set up a big swing turn and potentially win the game in one explosive combo."
