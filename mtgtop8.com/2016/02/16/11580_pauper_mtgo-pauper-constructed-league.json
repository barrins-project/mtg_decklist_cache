It focuses on playing low-cost spells to boost the power of creatures like Nivix Cyclops, Kiln Fiend, and Delver of Secrets, and using cards like Gush, Gut Shot, Lightning Bolt, and Temur Battle Rage to control the board and push for damage. The deck also includes card draw and protection spells like Dispel, Apostle's Blessing, and Mutagenic Growth to ensure consistency and protect its key creatures. Evolving Wilds is included for deck thinning and mana fixing."
