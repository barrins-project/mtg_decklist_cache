            "notes": "This Eldrazi Aggro deck focuses on quickly ramping out powerful Eldrazi creatures using lands like Eldrazi Temple and Eye of Ugin. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with early game aggression from creatures like Eldrazi Mimic and Reality Smasher, while disrupting their game plan with cards like Thought-Knot Seer and Chalice of the Void. The inclusion of utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Blinkmoth Nexus provide additional flexibility and control options. The deck's ability to quickly put pressure on opponents and disrupt their strategies makes it a formidable force in Modern 1 vs 1 matchups."
