            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by consistently assembling the Urzatron lands (Urza's Mine, Urza's Power Plant, Urza's Tower). By doing so, the deck gains a significant amount of mana, allowing it to cast powerful spells like Fangren Marauder, Mulldrifter, and Ulamog's Crusher. Additionally, the deck utilizes card draw and manipulation spells like Ancient Stirrings, Sea Gate Oracle, and Prophetic Prism to ensure consistency and find its key cards. The deck also incorporates removal spells like Chainer's Edict and Lightning Bolt to deal with threats, while having access to board wipes like Rolling Thunder."
