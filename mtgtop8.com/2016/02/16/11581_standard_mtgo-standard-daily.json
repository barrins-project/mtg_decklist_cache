            "notes": "The main idea behind this deck is to play aggressively with a mix of creatures, burn spells, and removal. By casting cheap creatures like Soulfire Grand Master and Monastery Mentor early on, followed by powerful spells like Crackling Doom and Kolaghan's Command, the deck aims to quickly take control of the game. The inclusion of cards like Pia and Kiran Nalaar and Goblin Dark-Dwellers provide additional value and versatility, while Ayli, Eternal Pilgrim and Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet help to stabilize the board and gain life. The planeswalkers Ob Nixilis Reignited and Chandra, Flamecaller act as finishers, providing card advantage and closing out the game."
