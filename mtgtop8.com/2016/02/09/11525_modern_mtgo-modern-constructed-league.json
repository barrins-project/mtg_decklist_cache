            "notes": "This Eldrazi Aggro deck focuses on quickly casting big Eldrazi creatures and disrupting opponents' hands with cards like Thought-Knot Seer. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Kozilek's Return to control the board. By using cards like Ancient Stirrings to find essential pieces and Eldrazi Temple to ramp, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful threats like Reality Smasher and World Breaker. With a mixture of aggression and disruption, this deck aims to quickly close out games before opponents have a chance to stabilize."

With a mix of creatures and spells that support the Eldrazi strategy, such as Dismember and Stubborn Denial, this deck is designed to consistently apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's plans."
