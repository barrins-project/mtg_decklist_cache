The deck also aims to utilize flying creatures like Thunderbreak Regent and Flamewake Phoenix to quickly deal damage to the opponent, backed up by the powerful pump effect of Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury. Additionally, the deck includes some disruption with Duress and removal spells like Murderous Cut and Fiery Impulse to control the tempo of the game."
