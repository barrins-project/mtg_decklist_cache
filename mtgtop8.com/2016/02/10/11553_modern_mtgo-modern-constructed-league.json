Blight Herder and Oblivion Sower provide additional value and disruption while Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer put pressure on the opponent. Lingering Souls provides additional blockers and Wasteland Strangler can deal with opposing threats. The deck also includes removal spells like Path to Exile and Dismember to deal with problematic creatures. The mana base is designed to support the Eldrazi theme while providing access to black and white spells."
