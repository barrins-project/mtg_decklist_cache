By combining efficient removal spells like Draconic Roar and counterspells like Silumgar's Scorn with card advantage engines like Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Dig Through Time, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining a strong board presence. Reflector Mage adds further versatility by bouncing problematic creatures back to the opponent's hand. This deck is designed to quickly close out games through a combination of creature-based aggression and control elements."

Additionally, cards like Collected Company and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy help you dig for your combo pieces while controlling the board with cards like Reflector Mage.

It aims to control the board with cards like Grasp of Darkness and Planar Outburst while generating card advantage with Read the Bones and planeswalker abilities. Seeker of the Way and Secure the Wastes provide early threats, and the Orzhov mana base ensures consistent access to both white and black mana sources. The deck's strength lies in its ability to disrupt the opponent's strategy while gradually building towards a dominant board position."
