The deck also includes ways to fill the graveyard with creatures, like Careful Study and Hapless Researcher, as well as disruption and protection spells like Thoughtseize, Force of Will, and Daze. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures early in the game and disrupt their game plan to secure a win through a powerful combo."
