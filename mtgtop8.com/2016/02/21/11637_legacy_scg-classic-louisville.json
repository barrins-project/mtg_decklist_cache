The deck aims to manipulate the top of the library using Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top, while also having card advantage and flexibility through Brainstorm and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. Additionally, the deck includes disruptive creatures like Venser, Shaper Savant and Vendilion Clique to further disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes a few win conditions like Monastery Mentor and Snapcaster Mage."

It aims to disrupt opponents with counter spells like Daze and Force of Will, while also utilizing burn spells such as Lightning Bolt and Price of Progress to finish off opponents quickly. The deck utilizes cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder to control draws and maintain tempo. The mana base is streamlined with fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistent access to both blue and red mana sources."
