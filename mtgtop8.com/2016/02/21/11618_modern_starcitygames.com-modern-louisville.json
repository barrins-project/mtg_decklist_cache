            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to ramp up quickly using cards like Sakura-Tribe Elder and Khalni Heart Expedition to get multiple lands into play. Once enough mountains are on the battlefield, cards like Scapeshift and Primeval Titan can trigger Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent in one turn. Cards like Prismatic Omen can help ensure that all your lands count as mountains for Valakut's ability. Protection and removal spells like Spellskite and Lightning Bolt help to control the game and protect your combo pieces."
