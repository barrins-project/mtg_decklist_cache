By casting Rally the Ancestors, the player can bring back all these creatures at once, triggering their abilities for maximum value. Cards like Nantuko Husk and Zulaport Cutthroat allow for explosive combo finishes by sacrificing creatures for massive damage. Collected Company helps to find key pieces of the combo quickly. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a flurry of triggers and combo interactions."
