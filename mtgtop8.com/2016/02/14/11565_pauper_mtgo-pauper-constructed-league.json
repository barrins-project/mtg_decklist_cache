The deck aims to ramp into powerful finishers like Ulamog's Crusher and Rolling Thunder, while also maintaining board presence with cards like Sea Gate Oracle and Mulldrifter. The key is to efficiently assemble the Urzatron lands to generate a significant amount of mana, allowing the player to cast high-impact spells and overwhelm the opponent. The deck combines control elements with a ramp strategy to dominate the late game and secure victory."
