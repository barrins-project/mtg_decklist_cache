It aims to apply pressure on the opponent by playing threats like Siege Rhino and Anafenza, the Foremost while disrupting their game plan with cards like Abzan Charm and Dromoka's Command. The deck also has some late-game power with cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Wingmate Roc to provide additional threats and resilience. The mana base is designed to support the three-color combination of white, black, and green."
