Once a critical mass of creatures is in the graveyard, the player can then cast Living End to bring them all back to the battlefield and overwhelm their opponent. Cards like Demonic Dread and Violent Outburst help set up this combo by allowing the player to cascade into Living End. Additionally, cards like Fulminator Mage and Beast Within provide disruption and removal options to control the game."

By combining lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident with cards like Spreading Seas and Sea's Claim, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly with an aggressive strategy. Aether Vial helps cheat creatures into play while Mutavault provides additional creature threats. Overall, the deck aims to establish early board presence and maintain tempo to secure a victory."
