It also uses various artifacts to fix mana, draw cards, and generate additional value. The deck includes removal spells to control the board and card draw to find key pieces. Overall, the strategy revolves around assembling the Urzatron lands and deploying big threats to overwhelm the opponent while maintaining control of the game through card advantage and removal."
