The deck aims to consistently apply pressure and force the opponent to react quickly, utilizing cards that can deal damage directly to the opponent or prevent them from gaining life. The deck also includes creatures with haste and abilities that punish opponents for casting spells, creating a fast-paced and aggressive playstyle that aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
