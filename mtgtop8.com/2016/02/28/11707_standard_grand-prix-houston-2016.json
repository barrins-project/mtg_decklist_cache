Nantuko Husk and Zulaport Cutthroat act as win conditions, sacrificing creatures for damage and life gain. The deck also includes cards like Jace, Vryn's Prodigy for additional value and card selection. The mana base is built to support the deck's color requirements and includes fetch lands for consistency."
