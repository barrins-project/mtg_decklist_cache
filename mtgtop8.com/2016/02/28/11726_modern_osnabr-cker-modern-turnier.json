By utilizing cards like Collected Company and Lead the Stampede, the deck aims to dig through the library to find key combo pieces like Ezuri, Renegade Leader and Shaman of the Pack. Once a critical mass of Elves is on the battlefield, Ezuri can pump them up for a lethal attack, supported by Shaman of the Pack's drain effect to finish off the opponent."
