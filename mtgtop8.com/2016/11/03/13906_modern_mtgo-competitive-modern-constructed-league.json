By utilizing cards like Faithless Looting, Cathartic Reunion, and Insolent Neonate, you can quickly dredge through your deck, bringing back creatures like Bloodghast and triggering abilities that allow you to flood the board with powerful threats. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with a fast and aggressive combo strategy that leverages the graveyard as a resource."
