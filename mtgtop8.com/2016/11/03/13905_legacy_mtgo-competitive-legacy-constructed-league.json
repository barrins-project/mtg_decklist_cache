The deck utilizes powerful card draw engines like Brainstorm and Sensei's Divining Top to set up powerful combos with Counterbalance. It also has access to versatile removal in the form of Swords to Plowshares and Terminus. The win condition is primarily through Entreat the Angels or through grinding opponents out with Jace, the Mind Sculptor. Overall, the deck aims to out-value and outlast opponents through efficient control tactics."

This is achieved through acceleration cards like Dark Ritual, Lotus Petal, and Simian Spirit Guide. The deck aims to disrupt opponents with cards like Thoughtseize and Collective Brutality while also utilizing Faithless Looting to fill the graveyard with targets for reanimation. The goal is to overwhelm opponents with fast, powerful creatures before they have a chance to respond."
