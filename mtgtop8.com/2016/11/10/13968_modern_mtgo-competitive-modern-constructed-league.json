The deck also makes use of graveyard synergies with Lingering Souls and Grim Flayer, while also gaining life and growing creatures with cards like Scavenging Ooze. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the three-color Abzan strategy. Ultimately, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creatures and disruption."

By casting spells like Lightning Bolt, Manamorphose, and Mutagenic Growth to trigger abilities and boost the power of these creatures, the deck aims to win the game through aggressive combat and direct damage. The inclusion of cards like Bedlam Reveler and Faithless Looting provide card advantage and help maintain momentum in the late game. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful offense."

It also includes disruption spells like Thought-Knot Seer and Path to Exile to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The combination of aggressive creatures like Reality Smasher and resilient threats like Drowner of Hope allows the deck to quickly overwhelm opponents and close out the game before they can stabilize. The sideboard likely includes additional disruption and removal spells to adapt to different matchups."
