Additionally, it has some burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Flame Slash to deal with threats and close out games.

It also includes creatures that provide card advantage and value, such as Mulldrifter and Peregrine Drake. The key strength of the deck lies in its ability to generate incremental advantage through recurring powerful spells like Ghostly Flicker and Archaeomancer. The mana base is designed to provide a good balance between colored sources and utility lands to ensure consistency in casting spells."
