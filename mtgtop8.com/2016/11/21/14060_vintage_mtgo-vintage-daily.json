By leveraging powerful mana acceleration from Mishra's Workshop and Ancient Tomb, the deck can quickly overwhelm opponents with disruptive cards like Sphere of Resistance and Thorn of Amethyst. With a combination of aggressive threats like Fleetwheel Cruiser, Triskelion, and Thought-Knot Seer, as well as resilient threats like Hangarback Walker and Arcbound Ravager, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's resources and game plan while quickly closing out the game."
