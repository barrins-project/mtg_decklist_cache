Stasis Snare offers removal, while Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides additional threats. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent casting of spells and activating abilities. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and disrupt their strategy to secure a quick victory."
