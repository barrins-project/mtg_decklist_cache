Voldaren Pariah serves as a powerful finisher while cards like Fiery Temper and Unlicensed Disintegration provide removal and direct damage. Cathartic Reunion helps to dig for key cards while Smuggler's Copter provides additional card draw and evasion. The mana base is set up to ensure consistent access to both black and red mana sources."

By utilizing cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, Spell Queller, and Archangel Avacyn, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while quickly building a threatening board presence. Additionally, cards like Stasis Snare and Smuggler's Copter provide removal and card advantage to further solidify the aggressive game plan. With a balanced mix of creatures and spells, this deck focuses on tempo and aggression to overwhelm the opponent."
