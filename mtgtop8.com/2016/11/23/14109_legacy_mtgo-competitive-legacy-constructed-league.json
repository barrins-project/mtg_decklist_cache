Additionally, the deck includes powerful lands like Ancient Tomb and Eye of Ugin to provide mana acceleration and support the Eldrazi strategy. Overall, the deck aims to establish board dominance early and maintain pressure throughout the game."

By utilizing powerful creatures like Monastery Mentor and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, the deck can generate incremental advantage and eventually close out the game with threats like Entreat the Angels. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up its own win conditions."

It utilizes powerful cards like Liliana of the Veil, Deathrite Shaman, and Tarmogoyf to pressure the opponent, while cards like Abrupt Decay, Force of Will, and Hymn to Tourach disrupt their plans. The deck also includes cards for card advantage like Ancestral Vision and Shardless Agent. Additionally, it has a land denial strategy with cards like Wasteland to hinder the opponent's mana development."
