By utilizing a mix of cheap creatures like Inventor's Apprentice and Toolcraft Exemplar alongside powerful threats such as Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Scrapheap Scrounger, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. With access to cards like Harnessed Lightning and Unlicensed Disintegration for removal, the deck can clear the way for its creatures to attack and close out the game quickly. The inclusion of vehicles like Smuggler's Copter and Cultivator's Caravan allows for additional ways to push through damage and maintain board presence."
