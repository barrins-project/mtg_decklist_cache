By efficiently blinking creatures like Mulldrifter and Peregrine Drake, the deck can outvalue opponents while disrupting their game plan with counterspells and removal spells. The deck also includes a small burn package for additional reach. Overall, the key concept is to grind out victories through resource management and versatility in card choices."
