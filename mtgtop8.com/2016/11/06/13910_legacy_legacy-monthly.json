By using mana acceleration cards like Ancient Tomb and Simian Spirit Guide, as well as disruptive cards like Chalice of the Void and Thought-Knot Seer, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building a board presence that can quickly close out the game. The inclusion of utility lands like Wasteland and Karakas also adds additional layers of disruption and control to the deck's strategy."
