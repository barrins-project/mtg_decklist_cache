            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to apply early pressure on the opponent by playing efficient creatures and disruptive spells in the first few turns. By using cards like Thoughtseize, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Liliana of the Veil to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while deploying threats like Tarmogoyf, Dark Confidant, and Huntmaster of the Fells to close out the game quickly. The deck also has removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Terminate to clear the way for your creatures. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggression and disruption."
