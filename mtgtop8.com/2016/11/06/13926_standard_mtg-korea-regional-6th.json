By playing evasive creatures like Spell Queller and Reflector Mage, along with removal spells like Stasis Snare and Declaration in Stone, the deck aims to keep the opponent on the back foot while growing its own board presence. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Archangel Avacyn provide additional threats and resilience. The mana base ensures consistent access to both colors of mana for the deck's spells and creatures. Overall, the deck aims to win through a combination of early pressure and disruption."
