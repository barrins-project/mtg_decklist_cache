The use of cards like Peregrine Drake and Mulldrifter provides mana advantage and card advantage respectively, allowing the player to outvalue their opponent. The inclusion of Ghostly Flicker allows for powerful synergies with cards like Archaeomancer, Sea Gate Oracle, and Mulldrifter, creating even more value and opportunities to control the game. The deck aims to grind out wins by outlasting the opponent and overwhelming them with card advantage and efficient threats."
