By using evasion and pump spells effectively, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with poison counters before they can mount a defense."

The synergy between these cards allows for explosive graveyard interactions, leading to a powerful combo where creatures can be constantly brought back and attackers overwhelming the opponent. The deck aims to win quickly by overwhelming the opponent with a steady stream of creatures from the graveyard."
