The inclusion of Torrential Gearhulk allows for big plays by casting instant spells from the graveyard. The deck also features card draw and energy generation to consistently have answers to threats and maintain control over the game."

The deck aims to quickly deploy threats like Grim Flayer and Mindwrack Demon, while using cards like Liliana, the Last Hope and Traverse the Ulvenwald to generate advantage and ensure a steady stream of threats. With a diverse mix of creatures and removal, the deck can adapt to different board states and outmaneuver opponents to secure victory."
