The deck includes a mix of cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder, along with control elements like Force of Will to protect the combo. Shardless Agent and Baleful Strix provide card advantage, while Cavern Harpy and Parasitic Strix help generate value through recursion. Deathrite Shaman also adds versatility and disruption to the deck. The overall strategy revolves around assembling the Aluren combo while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
