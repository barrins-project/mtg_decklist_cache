It uses cards like Attune with Aether and Glint-Nest Crane to find key pieces, while also having emergency plans with Contingency Plan and Kozilek's Return. The deck includes energy generators and various puzzleknots to fuel the Marvel activation, creating a combo-centric strategy focused on quickly ramping into game-ending threats. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with massive creatures and close out the game before they can respond effectively."
