Prized Amalgam helps to bring back creatures from the graveyard, while cards like Life from the Loam and Conflagrate help to control the game and deal damage to your opponent. The deck aims to quickly overwhelm your opponent by recurring creatures and using graveyard synergies to gain advantage and win the game."
