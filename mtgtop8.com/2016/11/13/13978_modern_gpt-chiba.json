This allows the player to attack aggressively without fear of their creature being targeted by removal spells or abilities. The deck also includes cards like Leyline of Sanctity for protection and Path to Exile for removal, making it difficult for opponents to disrupt the game plan. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy with a focus on fetching the necessary colors of mana."
