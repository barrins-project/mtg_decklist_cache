By utilizing powerful creatures like Emrakul, the Promised End and Ishkanah, Grafwidow, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of threats. Cards like Liliana, the Last Hope and Noxious Gearhulk provide removal and additional value, while the deck's mana base ensures a consistent flow of plays throughout the game."
