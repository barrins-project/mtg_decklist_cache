By utilizing artifact creatures and vehicles like Scrapheap Scrounger and Smuggler's Copter, the deck aims to maintain aggression and generate card advantage. Additionally, the inclusion of Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides a resilient threat that can quickly close out games."

The key focus is on utilizing powerful cards like Archangel Avacyn, Reflector Mage, Spell Queller, and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar to apply pressure on the opponent quickly. Selfless Spirit and Stasis Snare provide protection and removal, while cards like Smuggler's Copter allow for card draw and additional aggression. The deck aims to control the board and overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and disruptive spells to secure victory in a Standard 1 vs 1 match."
