By utilizing cards like Ancestral Mask, Ethereal Armor, and Armadillo Cloak, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with large, buffed-up creatures that are difficult to deal with. The inclusion of mana ramp cards like Utopia Sprawl and Wild Growth helps to accelerate the deck's game plan, allowing for early aggression and pressure. Additionally, the deck includes some protection with cards like Slippery Bogle and Gladecover Scout to ensure its creatures stay on the battlefield."
