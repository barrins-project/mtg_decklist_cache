By utilizing counterspells like Spellstutter Sprite and Counterspell, along with bounce spells like Snap and Deprive, it aims to disrupt opponent's game plan while maintaining tempo. The card draw from Ponder and Preordain helps ensure a consistent flow of threats, while Gush provides additional card advantage. The inclusion of equipment like Bonesplitter enhances the deck's aggressive capabilities, while Spire Golem serves as a powerful late-game threat."
