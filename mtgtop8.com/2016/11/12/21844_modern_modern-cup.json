It also utilizes hand disruption spells to control the opponent's resources and keep the pressure on. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Ajani Vengeant provide additional threats and versatility. The mana base is optimized for consistency and allows for the timely casting of spells. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to apply constant pressure and quickly close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The combination of efficient threats like Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant, along with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Terminate, allows the deck to quickly reduce the opponent's life total and maintain control of the game. The planeswalkers, Liliana of the Veil and Chandra, Torch of Defiance, provide additional value and card advantage to help secure victory."

Cards like Through the Breach and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn provide alternate win conditions. In addition, cards like Courser of Kruphix and Oath of Nissa help with card advantage and card selection. The inclusion of cards like Nahiri, the Harbinger and Gut Shot provide additional utility and ways to interact with the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to quickly ramp up mana and overwhelm the opponent with powerful combos and threats."
