The deck also aims to maintain tempo and pressure with powerful vehicles such as Smuggler's Copter and Fleetwheel Cruiser. The inclusion of removal spells like Declaration in Stone and Stasis Snare helps to clear opposing threats, while cards like Selfless Spirit and Archangel Avacyn provide protection and resilience. Overall, the deck prioritizes early aggression, board presence, and versatility in combat."
