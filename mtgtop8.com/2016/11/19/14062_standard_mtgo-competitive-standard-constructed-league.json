            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly deploying evasive threats to pressure the opponent into making suboptimal plays. By utilizing cards like Smuggler's Copter and Spell Queller, the deck aims to control the board while dealing consistent damage. Cards like Reflector Mage and Archangel Avacyn provide additional tempo swings to gain an advantage. With a mix of counterspells and removal, the deck can answer opposing threats while maintaining pressure. The key strategy is to maintain a fast clock while disrupting the opponent's game plan, ultimately overwhelming them before they can stabilize."
