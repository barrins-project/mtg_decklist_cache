By protecting its creatures from targeted removal and pumping them up with multiple enchantments, the deck aims to deal massive damage and overwhelm opponents before they can establish their own game plan. The deck includes minimal spells to maximize the number of creatures and auras, ensuring a consistent and aggressive gameplay. Additionally, the inclusion of mana acceleration helps to quickly get the necessary resources for casting multiple auras on a single creature."
