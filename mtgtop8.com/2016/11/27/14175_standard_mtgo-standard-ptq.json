In addition, the deck utilizes powerful removal spells like Harnessed Lightning and Unlicensed Disintegration to control the board and keep the opponent on the back foot. The inclusion of vehicles like Smuggler's Copter and Cultivator's Caravan allows for additional creature mobility and damage output. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and efficient creature-based threats."
