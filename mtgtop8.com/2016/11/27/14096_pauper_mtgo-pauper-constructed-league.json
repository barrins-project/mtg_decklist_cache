It includes disruption cards like Spellstutter Sprite and Counterspell to control the board and protect its creatures. The deck also includes card advantage through cantrips like Ponder and Preordain. The overall strategy is to maintain a tempo advantage with the potential for strong card draw and disruption, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with a combination of evasion, counterspells, and bounce effects."
