            "notes": "The primary focus of this deck is to disrupt your opponent's game plan by taxing their resources while applying pressure with aggressive creatures. The deck utilizes cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Sanctum Prelate to slow down opponents, while also using disruptive creatures like Phyrexian Revoker and Spirit of the Labyrinth to shut down key cards. The deck can also quickly close out games with efficient beaters such as Mirran Crusader and equipment like Sword of Fire and Ice. The mana denial strategy with cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port is also crucial for controlling the game."
