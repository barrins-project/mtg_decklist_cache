Using cards like Cathartic Reunion and Faithless Looting to draw more cards and Life from the Loam to bring back lands, the deck aims to have a consistent stream of creatures entering the battlefield. With the ability to dredge through the deck quickly, the deck can overwhelm opponents with a large board presence early in the game."
