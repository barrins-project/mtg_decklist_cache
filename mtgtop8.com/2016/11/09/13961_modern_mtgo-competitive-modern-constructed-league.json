Cards like Goblin Electromancer reduce the cost of spells, while Gitaxian Probe and Serum Visions help dig for combo pieces. Gifts Ungiven is a versatile card that can set up the combo, while Past in Flames allows for spell recursion. Remand provides both disruption and card draw to keep the combo going."
