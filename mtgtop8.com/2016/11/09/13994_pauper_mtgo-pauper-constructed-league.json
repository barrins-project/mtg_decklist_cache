The key strategy is to play low-cost creatures like Gladecover Scout and Slippery Bogle, then attach powerful auras like Ancestral Mask, Ethereal Armor, and Armadillo Cloak to them to create massive threats that are difficult to deal with. By combining efficient creatures with powerful auras, this deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
