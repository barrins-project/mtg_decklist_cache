It also applies pressure with aggressive creatures and powerful equipment. By utilizing creatures with disruptive abilities like Thalia and Phyrexian Revoker, along with efficient removal spells like Swords to Plowshares, the deck aims to control the tempo of the game and outvalue the opponent. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for quick deployment of creatures and makes it difficult for the opponent to react effectively. The deck's mana denial plan is further supported by Wasteland and Rishadan Port, creating a challenging board state for the opponent to navigate."
