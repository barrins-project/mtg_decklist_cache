By utilizing cards like Slippery Bogle and Ancestral Mask, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a highly buffed creature early in the game. With support from cards like Armadillo Cloak and Ethereal Armor, the goal is to deal massive damage quickly and efficiently. The deck also includes some removal spells like Journey to Nowhere to deal with any opposing threats, while still keeping the pressure on with aggressive creatures like Kor Skyfisher and Gladecover Scout."
