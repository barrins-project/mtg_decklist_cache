This is achieved through cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Leonin Arbiter, which make spells and searching for lands more expensive for the opponent. Eldrazi Displacer and Flickerwisp provide additional disruption by flickering creatures and resetting their abilities. This disruptive strategy is complemented by a strong removal package, highlighted by Path to Exile, Wasteland Strangler, and Tidehollow Sculler. The deck also utilizes Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play and maintain a high tempo."
