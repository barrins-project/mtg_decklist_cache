By combining a mix of powerful planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance, along with low-cost creatures and removal spells like Fiery Temper and Unlicensed Disintegration, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The inclusion of vehicles like Smuggler's Copter adds additional aggression and card selection, while cards like Scrapheap Scrounger provide resilience and staying power in longer games."
