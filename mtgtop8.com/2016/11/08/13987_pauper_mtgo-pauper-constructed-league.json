The goal is to control the board early on while applying pressure with creatures like Delver of Secrets and Gurmag Angler. The deck also includes card draw and graveyard synergies to ensure a steady stream of resources. The key strategy is to tempo out the opponent by efficiently using the limited resources available in the Pauper format, while maintaining a solid board presence."
