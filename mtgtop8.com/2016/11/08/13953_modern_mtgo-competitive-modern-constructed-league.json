Additionally, the deck is able to quickly remove threats with cards like Lightning Bolt, Terminate, and Abrupt Decay, keeping the board clear for its aggressive creatures to push through damage. With a well-balanced mix of threats and answers, this deck seeks to outpace and overwhelm the opponent in a fast-paced Modern format."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on using powerful creatures and disruption spells to apply pressure on the opponent. It combines efficient creatures like Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Terminate to control the board and chip away at the opponent's life total. The planeswalkers Liliana of the Veil and Liliana, the Last Hope provide additional value and disruption, while cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek help to strip the opponent's hand of key cards. Overall, the deck aims to be proactive and aggressive, while still being able to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
