The deck also includes some card draw spells like Preordain and Accumulated Knowledge to ensure a steady stream of resources. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to control the game tempo and grind out a victory over the opponent."

By leveraging aggressive creatures and powerful artifact synergies, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and resilient board presence. Synergistic cards like Atog and Fling provide additional ways to close out games and deal damage, making for a versatile and potent strategy."
