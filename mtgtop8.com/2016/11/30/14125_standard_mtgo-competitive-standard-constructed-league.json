This combo-focused deck aims to ramp up mana quickly and overwhelm the opponent with big threats, while also using cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Ishkanah, Grafwidow for additional control and value. The deck utilizes a mix of removal, card draw, and energy generation to create a powerful and versatile strategy."
