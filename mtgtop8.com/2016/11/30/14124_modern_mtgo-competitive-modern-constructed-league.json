Additionally, the inclusion of Eldrazi Displacer and Flickerwisp allows for additional disruption and synergy with creatures like Thought-Knot Seer and Tidehollow Sculler. The deck also includes removal spells like Path to Exile to deal with threats, making it a well-rounded aggro deck focused on disrupting the opponent's strategy."
