The deck utilizes cards like Lotus Petal, Lion's Eye Diamond, Dark Ritual, and Cabal Ritual to generate mana quickly, along with cantrips like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain to dig for combo pieces. Cabal Therapy and Duress are used to disrupt the opponent's hand, while Gitaxian Probe provides information. The deck is focused on executing a powerful storm combo efficiently to overwhelm the opponent."
