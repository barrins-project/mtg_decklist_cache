By giving these creatures hexproof, they become nearly impossible for opponents to target or remove. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with highly buffed, protected creatures that can quickly chip away at their life total. With a mix of auras and protection spells, this deck aims to create a fast, aggressive strategy that can outpace and outmaneuver opponents in a 1 vs 1 format."
