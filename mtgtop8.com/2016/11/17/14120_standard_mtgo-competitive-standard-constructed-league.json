By leveraging cards like Grim Flayer, Liliana, the Last Hope, and Ishkanah, Grafwidow, along with access to powerful removal spells like Grasp of Darkness and Ruinous Path, this deck aims to grind out the opponent and ultimately win through incremental advantage and efficient removal. The inclusion of Emrakul, the Promised End provides a late-game win condition that can swing the game in the player's favor."
