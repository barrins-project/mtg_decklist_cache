By utilizing cards like Smuggler's Copter and Spell Queller to quickly establish a threatening board presence while also removing threats with Stasis Snare and Reflector Mage, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Archangel Avacyn provide additional ways to close out the game quickly and protect your creatures from removal."

The deck includes a variety of energy-generating cards like Servant of the Conduit and Attune with Aether to fuel the Marvel's ability. Additionally, there are cards like Kozilek's Return and Harnessed Lightning for removal and control. Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides additional card advantage and burn potential. Overall, the goal of this deck is to quickly ramp up energy and dominate the board with big threats."
