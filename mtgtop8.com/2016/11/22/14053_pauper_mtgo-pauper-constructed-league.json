This mana is then used to cast powerful colorless spells, such as Fangren Marauder, Mulldrifter, and Ulamog's Crusher. The deck also includes card draw and removal spells to control the game and outvalue the opponent. The main win condition is to overwhelm the opponent with big threats and efficiently answer any threats they may present."
