Cards like Reflector Mage and Spell Queller help disrupt the opponent's plans while Selfless Spirit provides protection for your creatures. Stasis Snare and Declaration in Stone offer removal options, while Smuggler's Copter provides card advantage and additional threats. Revolutionary Rebuff helps protect your board and keep the pressure on. The mana base ensures consistent access to both colors of mana for the spells in the deck."
