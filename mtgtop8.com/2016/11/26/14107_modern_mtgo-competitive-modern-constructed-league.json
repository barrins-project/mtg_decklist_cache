With strong creatures like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher, along with mana acceleration from Noble Hierarch and Eldrazi Temple, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Cards like Drowner of Hope and Eldrazi Displacer provide additional utility, while disruption spells like Path to Exile and Thought-Knot Seer's ability to exile cards from the opponent's hand help maintain control of the game. Overall, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
