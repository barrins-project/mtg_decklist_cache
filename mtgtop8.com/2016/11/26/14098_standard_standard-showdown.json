By using cards like Metalspinner's Puzzleknot and Prophetic Prism to generate mana and draw cards, the deck aims to ramp up quickly and drop threats like Metalwork Colossus and Elder Deep-Fiend ahead of schedule. The deck also includes versatile cards like Fumigate and Spatial Contortion to deal with opposing threats and maintain board control."
