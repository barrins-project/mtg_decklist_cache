The deck focuses on using cards like Grim Flayer, Ishkanah, Grafwidow, and Mindwrack Demon to outvalue the opponent. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Liliana, the Last Hope and Emrakul, the Promised End for powerful late-game threats. By utilizing a mix of removal, recursion, and threats, this Golgari Control deck aims to grind out the opponent and eventually win through card advantage and powerful finishers."

The deck also includes cards like Cathartic Reunion and Insolent Neonate to help cycle through the deck and find the necessary pieces. The inclusion of Kozilek's Return provides a board wipe option while Key to the City helps enable attacks and additional card draw. Lightning Axe and Fiery Temper offer removal options, while Distended Mindbender can disrupt the opponent's hand."
