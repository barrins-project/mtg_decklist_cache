The deck includes various land destruction cards like Wasteland and Ghost Quarter to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Additionally, it has cards like Life from the Loam and Exploration to consistently develop its own mana base and generate value. Punishing Fire provides additional removal while Molten Vortex can be used to deal direct damage to the opponent."
