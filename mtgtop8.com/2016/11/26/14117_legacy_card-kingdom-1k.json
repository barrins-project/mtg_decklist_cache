By using cards like Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith, the deck can draw through its library and find its key combo pieces, such as Craterhoof Behemoth. Natural Order can then be used to search for the Behemoth and finish the game with a massive attack. The deck utilizes efficient mana producers like Heritage Druid and Wirewood Symbiote to accelerate its game plan and overwhelm the opponent."

Cards like Eldrazi Mimic and Endless One can also be played for free or reduced costs. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher, while controlling the board with Chalice of the Void and various removal spells. The deck is designed to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and strong synergy between its Eldrazi cards."
