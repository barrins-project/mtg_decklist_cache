The inclusion of cards like Skarrgan Pit-Skulk, Silhana Ledgewalker, and River Boa ensures that the deck maintains a strong presence on the battlefield while also being difficult to block or remove. The deck also includes some cards for additional protection and damage, such as Hunger of the Howlpack, Mutagenic Growth, and Bonesplitter. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and overwhelm the opponent's defenses."

Distant Melody and Wellwisher provide card advantage and life gain, while cards like Quirion Ranger and Birchlore Rangers help to maximize mana efficiency and creature output. Overall, the strategy is to flood the board with Elves and use their synergies to beat down the opponent quickly."
