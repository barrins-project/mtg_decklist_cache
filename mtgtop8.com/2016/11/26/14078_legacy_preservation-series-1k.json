Imperial Recruiter can tutor for combo pieces, while Goblin Welder can help recur important artifacts. Red and blue counterspells provide protection and control elements, with additional cards for card selection and disruption. The deck aims to lock down the opponent with Ensnaring Bridge and win through the combo or by controlling the game's pace."
