The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent with evasive threats like Smuggler's Copter and Archangel Avacyn, while also protecting its creatures with Selfless Spirit. Gideon, Ally of Zendikar provides a powerful anthem effect to boost the team, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. Overall, this deck focuses on aggressive tempo plays and efficient removal to secure victory."
