Ensnaring Bridge and Pithing Needle are used to protect against attacking creatures and activated abilities, while cards like Collective Brutality and Thoughtseize help disrupt the opponent's hand. The deck also has ways to recycle key pieces from the graveyard with cards like Surgical Extraction and Academy Ruins. The goal is to lock down the opponent's options and win through attrition."
