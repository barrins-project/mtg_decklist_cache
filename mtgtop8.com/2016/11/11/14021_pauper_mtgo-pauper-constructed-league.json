With cards like Nettle Sentinel and Skarrgan Pit-Skulk, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and make it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. The inclusion of pump spells like Groundswell and Vines of Vastwood provide additional reach and can lead to surprising bursts of damage. Overall, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and close out the game quickly before the opponent can mount a defense."
