Once Valakut is on the battlefield, the goal is to play Primeval Titan to fetch more Mountains, triggering Valakut's ability to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent's creatures or life total. The deck also includes cards like Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods for removal and control, allowing the player to eventually win through a powerful combo."
