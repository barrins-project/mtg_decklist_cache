The deck also utilizes powerful removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Gurmag Angler to control the board and maintain tempo. The deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total and prevent them from stabilizing, ultimately securing a victory through aggressive plays and efficient card advantage."

The deck is focused on aggressive plays, using cards like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer to disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining a high level of pressure. With a strong mana base and disruptive elements like Chalice of the Void, the deck aims to quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to establish their own game plan."
