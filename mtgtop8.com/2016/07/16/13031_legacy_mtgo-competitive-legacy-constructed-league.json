With a range of disruptive cards like Hymn to Tourach and Thoughtseize, along with versatile removal options like Abrupt Decay and Maelstrom Pulse, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while deploying threats like Tarmogoyf, Tasigur, and True-Name Nemesis to close out the game quickly. The mana base is designed to support the deck's diverse color requirements while also leveraging Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's mana base."
