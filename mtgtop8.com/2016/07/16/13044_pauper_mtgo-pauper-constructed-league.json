It aims to maintain card advantage through cards like Archaeomancer, Mulldrifter, and Peregrine Drake. The key strategy involves leveraging the flicker effect of cards like Ghostly Flicker to reuse powerful enter-the-battlefield effects of creatures like Mulldrifter. The deck also includes some burn spells like Rolling Thunder and Firebolt for direct damage. Overall, the deck is designed to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent in a slow and methodical manner."
