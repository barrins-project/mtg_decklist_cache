Death's Shadow is a key card in this deck, as its power/toughness is dependent on the player's life total, allowing for devastating attacks. Thoughtseize is included to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while Mishra's Bauble and Gitaxian Probe provide card draw and knowledge of the opponent's hand. The deck aims to win quickly by overwhelming the opponent with damage."

By utilizing cards like Noble Hierarch and Ancient Stirrings to ramp up mana and find key threats like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer, the deck aims to disrupt opponents and close out games swiftly. The inclusion of cards like Tarmogoyf and Path to Exile provides additional versatility and disruption, while the lands in the deck ensure consistent access to the Eldrazi creatures. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board control to secure victories."
