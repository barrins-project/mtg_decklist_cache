By playing creatures like Lambholt Pacifist and Thalia's Lieutenant, along with powerful spells like Collected Company and Dromoka's Command, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Reflector Mage and Eldrazi Displacer offers extra utility and disruption to control the game. This deck focuses on efficiently deploying threats and controlling the board to secure victories."
