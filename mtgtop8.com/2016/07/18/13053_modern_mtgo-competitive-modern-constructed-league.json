The deck utilizes mana acceleration from cards like Noble Hierarch and Eldrazi Temple to rapidly cast its threats and overwhelm the opponent. Additionally, cards like Eldrazi Displacer provide utility and disruption. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the Eldrazi creatures and ensure consistent casting of spells. Overall, the strategy of the deck is to apply early pressure and maintain control of the game with its powerful creatures."
