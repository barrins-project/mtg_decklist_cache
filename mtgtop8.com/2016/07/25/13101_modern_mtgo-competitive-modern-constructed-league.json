Aether Vial allows you to cheat creatures into play, while Eldrazi Displacer and Flickerwisp provide additional disruption and value."

The deck aims to take advantage of tribal synergies and lord effects to pump up its creatures and push through damage. It also utilizes disruption elements like Cursecatcher and Spell Pierce to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for quick deployment of creatures and maintaining pressure on the opponent. By combining aggression with synergy, this deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver the opposition in the Modern format."
