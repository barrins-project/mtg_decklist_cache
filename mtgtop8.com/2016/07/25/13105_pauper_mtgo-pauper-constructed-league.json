The key strategy revolves around using cards like Atog and Fling to sacrifice artifacts for additional damage, while also utilizing cards like Galvanic Blast for direct damage to the opponent. The deck also includes card draw and mana fixing to ensure consistency and efficiency in executing its aggressive game plan."
