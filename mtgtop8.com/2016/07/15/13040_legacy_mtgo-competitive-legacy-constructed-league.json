The deck aims to quickly apply pressure with cards like Delver of Secrets, Tarmogoyf, and Deathrite Shaman, while protecting its own creatures with cards like Force of Will and Daze. By utilizing a combination of countermagic and removal, the deck looks to control the game tempo and win through aggressive creature damage. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and provide access to key lands like Wasteland for disrupting opponents' mana bases."

The win condition of the deck is often through resolving Entreat the Angels to create a board presence or by outvaluing the opponent with card advantage and control elements."

By utilizing cards like Brainstorm, Sensei's Divining Top, and Counterbalance, the player can control what their opponent can play while also setting up favorable draws. Entreat the Angels provides a win condition by creating a swarm of angels, while Terminus serves as a board wipe option. Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor offer versatility and card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to outlast opponents and slowly grind out a victory through strong control and resource management."
