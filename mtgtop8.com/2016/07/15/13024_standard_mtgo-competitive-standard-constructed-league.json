By utilizing cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Always Watching, the deck aims to pump up its creatures and keep them protected while attacking. With cards like Declaration in Stone for removal and Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit for additional synergy, this deck aims to win the game quickly and aggressively. The key strategy is to flood the board with cheap creatures and use various buffs to turn them into powerful threats."
