By using a variety of artifact mana sources and card draw spells, the deck aims to quickly flood the board with efficient threats like Myr Enforcer and Frogmite. The deck also includes cards like Galvanic Blast and Atog to provide reach and additional ways to close out the game. The key strategy is to maintain a high creature count while utilizing the deck's affinity for artifacts to create explosive turns and outpace the opponent."
