By utilizing cards like Kytheon, Hero of Akros and Town Gossipmonger, this deck aims to maintain a fast and aggressive tempo by constantly putting pressure on the opponent. Declaration in Stone provides removal for any threats that may stand in the way, while Gryff's Boon offers evasion and additional damage potential. The deck's synergy lies in its ability to go wide and go fast, aiming to win the game before the opponent has a chance to fully establish their game plan."
