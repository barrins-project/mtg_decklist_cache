This is complemented by powerful creatures like Bruna, Gisela, and Kalitas to apply pressure and secure victory. The deck also features card advantage and selection tools like Read the Bones and Geier Reach Sanitarium, as well as planeswalkers such as Liliana and Sorin for additional board presence and utility. The goal is to outvalue the opponent and dictate the pace of the game until emerging victorious."
