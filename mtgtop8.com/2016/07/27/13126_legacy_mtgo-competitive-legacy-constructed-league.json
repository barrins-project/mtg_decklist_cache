By utilizing fast mana sources like Ancient Tomb and Simian Spirit Guide, this deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and close out the match with big threats like Reality Smasher and Endbringer. The deck also includes utility lands like Wasteland and Mishra's Factory to provide additional disruption and flexibility in various matchups."
