By utilizing cards such as Life from the Loam, Gamble, and Crop Rotation, the player can consistently access powerful lands like Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage to create a powerful combo. Punishing Fire helps control the opponent's creatures, while Wasteland disrupts their mana base. The inclusion of cards like Maze of Ith and Glacial Chasm further solidify the deck's control strategy, making it difficult for the opponent to mount an offensive. The goal is to grind out incremental advantages and ultimately overwhelm the opponent with land-based control."
