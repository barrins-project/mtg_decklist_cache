Kiora, Master of the Depths provides card advantage and further ramp, while Drowner of Hope and Endless One offer flexibility in creature options. The deck aims to control the board through removal and counterspells, using cards like Part the Waterveil to take extra turns and secure the win. The synergy between green ramp and control elements creates a potent and versatile strategy for dominating the game."
