The deck also includes cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Shard Volley to punish opponents for playing spells, as well as spells like Boros Charm and Lightning Helix for added reach and versatility. The mana base is designed to facilitate casting spells on curve and includes fetch lands to thin the deck and trigger landfall effects."
