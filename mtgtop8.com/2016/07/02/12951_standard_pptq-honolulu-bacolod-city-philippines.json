By curving out with creatures like Bounding Krasis, Reflector Mage, and Sylvan Advocate, and using cards like Collected Company and Dromoka's Command to generate value and control the board, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive threats while maintaining versatility and resilience. The mana base is specifically designed to support the deck's color requirements and ensure consistent performance."
