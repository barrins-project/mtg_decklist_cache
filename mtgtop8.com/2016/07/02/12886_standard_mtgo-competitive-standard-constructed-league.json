Cards like Anointer of Champions, Town Gossipmonger, and Thalia's Lieutenant provide value by buffing other creatures or creating additional threats. Always Watching gives all creatures on the battlefield a boost and helps maintain pressure on the opponent. Declaration in Stone can be used to deal with enemy threats while maintaining a board presence. The deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

With a mix of aggressive creatures like Lambholt Pacifist and Thalia's Lieutenant, along with disruptive spells like Reflector Mage and Dromoka's Command, the deck aims to quickly establish a board presence and control the tempo of the game. Collected Company helps to refill the board with additional threats, while cards like Archangel Avacyn and Eldrazi Displacer provide added versatility and protection. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
