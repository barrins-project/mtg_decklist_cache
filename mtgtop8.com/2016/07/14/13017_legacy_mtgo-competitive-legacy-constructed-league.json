By using cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Snapcaster Mage, and Counterbalance, the player can effectively control the opponent's actions and disruption. Cards like Terminus and Swords to Plowshares provide removal options, while Ponder, Brainstorm, and Sensei's Divining Top allow the player to set up their draws and react to the opponent's plays. The inclusion of Entreat the Angels gives the player a win condition, allowing them to close out the game once they have gained control."
