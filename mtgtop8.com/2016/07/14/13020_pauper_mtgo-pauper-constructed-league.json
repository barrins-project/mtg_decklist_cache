The deck focuses on blinking creatures with cards like Ghostly Flicker to trigger their abilities multiple times, while also having a control aspect with Counterspell and removal spells like Flame Slash and Lightning Bolt. The deck aims to outgrind the opponent with card advantage from Mulldrifter and draw spells like Compulsive Research, while also having a win condition in Rolling Thunder to finish off the game."
