Cards like Sphinx's Tutelage and Startled Awake help mill the opponent's deck while cards like Tormenting Voice and Curious Homunculus help the player draw more cards. Lightning Axe and Kozilek's Return provide removal options while Bedlam Reveler can provide a big finisher. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while slowly building up card advantage and controlling the game."
