By continuously adding to the board and utilizing cards like Always Watching and Thalia's Lieutenant to boost the team's power, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of small but efficient creatures. Additionally, Declaration in Stone provides removal and disruption as needed to clear the way for attacks. The key strategy is to maintain pressure and tempo while keeping the opponent on the back foot."
