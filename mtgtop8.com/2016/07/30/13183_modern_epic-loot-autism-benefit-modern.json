It includes a mix of color-fixing artifacts, powerful threats like Karn Liberated and Wurmcoil Engine, and removal spells like Path to Exile and Oblivion Stone to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to ramp up quickly, disrupt the opponent's strategy, and ultimately overwhelm them with powerful threats and card advantage."
