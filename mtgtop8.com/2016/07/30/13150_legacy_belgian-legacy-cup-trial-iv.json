The deck also includes protection in the form of counterspells like Force of Will and Daze, while also providing card selection and digging for combo pieces with Brainstorm and Ponder.

The deck aims to control the game early on with disruptive elements and then transition into a strong aggressive strategy with a high creature count, supported by mana acceleration from Chrome Mox and Ancient Tomb. The deck utilizes both disruptive and aggressive elements to create a powerful and fast-paced strategy in Legacy 1 vs 1 gameplay."
