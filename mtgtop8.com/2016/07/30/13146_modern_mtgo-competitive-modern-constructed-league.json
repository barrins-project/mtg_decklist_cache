The deck aims to stabilize the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Secure the Wastes, while using versatile spells like Cryptic Command and Esper Charm to disrupt the opponent's game plan. With strong card advantage engines like Sphinx's Revelation and Snapcaster Mage, the deck can outvalue opponents in the late game. The mana base is carefully designed to support the deck's powerful spells while providing flexibility in casting different colors of spells."
