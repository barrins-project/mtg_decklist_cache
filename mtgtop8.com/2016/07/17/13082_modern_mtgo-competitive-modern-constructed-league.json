By using cards like Gitaxian Probe and Street Wraith to pay life for card draw and pump spells like Become Immense and Temur Battle Rage to increase the power of your creatures, you can deal a large amount of damage in a short amount of time. The deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with fast, efficient threats and end the game quickly."
