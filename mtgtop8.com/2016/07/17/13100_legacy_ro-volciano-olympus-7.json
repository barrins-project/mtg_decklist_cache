Terminus serves as a powerful board wipe, while Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and disruption. The deck aims to outlast opponents by efficiently managing resources and answering threats, eventually overwhelming them with superior card advantage and control."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by using various counterspells and removal cards in order to protect the creatures that are critical for victory, such as Stoneforge Mystic and Snapcaster Mage. The deck utilizes cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Vendilion Clique for card advantage and disruption, while also having access to powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Batterskull to further strengthen its creatures. Back to Basics can also be used to slow down opponents who heavily rely on nonbasic lands. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast opponents through careful resource management and strategic decision-making."
