Additionally, the deck has versatility with the inclusion of versatile cards like Fire/Ice and Deathrite Shaman, allowing for flexibility in different matchups. Overall, the goal is to apply pressure early and disrupt the opponent's game plan to secure a quick victory."

Cards like Sire of Insanity and Griselbrand provide powerful threats that can quickly end the game. The deck aims to win through combo-ing off with these reanimated creatures and overpowering the opponent before they have a chance to react."
