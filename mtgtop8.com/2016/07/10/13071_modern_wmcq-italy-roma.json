The deck utilizes cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Pentad Prism to generate mana quickly, while also including Pact of Negation and Spoils of the Vault for protection and searching for key combo pieces. Additionally, Phyrexian Unlife helps to keep the player alive while setting up the combo. The deck is primarily focused on executing a powerful and quick win condition."
