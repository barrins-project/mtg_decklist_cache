By consistently applying pressure and disrupting the opponent's game plan with counter spells, this UR Aggro deck aims to finish the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The deck relies on efficient spells like Lightning Bolt and Price of Progress to deal damage while utilizing creatures like Delver of Secrets and Monastery Swiftspear to chip away at the opponent's life total. The mana base is designed to support the deck's low curve and ensure consistency in casting spells on time."
