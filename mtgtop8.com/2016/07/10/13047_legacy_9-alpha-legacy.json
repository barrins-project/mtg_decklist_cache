With a low mana curve and plenty of direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Price of Progress, the goal is to reduce the opponent's life total to zero as quickly as possible. The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Sulfuric Vortex puts pressure on the opponent and punishes them for playing spells, while creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear provide early aggression. This deck aims to win the game by overwhelming the opponent with damage before they can stabilize."
