            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly filling the graveyard with cards to benefit from the Dredge mechanic, allowing for recurring creatures like Bloodghast, Golgari Grave-Troll, and Prized Amalgam. The goal is to use cards like Faithless Looting, Burning Inquiry, and Shriekhorn to dump cards into the graveyard, enabling the player to constantly bring back creatures and overwhelm the opponent. This strategy aims to create a fast and powerful board presence by leveraging the graveyard as a resource for a potent combo-based playstyle."

It utilizes a mix of card draw, removal spells, and counterspells to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect Nahiri until she can ultimate. The deck also includes flexible spells like Lightning Bolt and Lightning Helix for additional removal and burn damage. The mana base is designed to support both Nahiri's color requirements and the deck's control elements."
