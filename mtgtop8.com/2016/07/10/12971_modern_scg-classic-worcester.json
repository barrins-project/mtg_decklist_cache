It also utilizes cards like Leonin Arbiter and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to slow down the opponent's mana development. With the help of Aether Vial, the deck can quickly put creatures onto the battlefield and apply pressure. By combining disruptive elements with a fast aggro strategy, this deck aims to control the game and come out victorious in a 1 vs 1 matchup."
