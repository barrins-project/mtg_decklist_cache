It utilizes powerful cards like Tarmogoyf, Dark Confidant, and Liliana of the Veil to generate card advantage and pressure the opponent's resources. The mana base is carefully constructed to support a consistent and streamlined game plan, with a mix of fetch lands and shock lands to ensure access to all necessary colors. The goal of this deck is to apply constant pressure to opponents and disrupt their game plan with efficient removal spells."
