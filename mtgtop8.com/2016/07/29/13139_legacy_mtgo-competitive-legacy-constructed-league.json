The main strategy is to reanimate high-impact creatures like Griselbrand and Iona, Shield of Emeria to dominate the game early on. The deck also includes cards like Thoughtseize and Unmask to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own key cards. The mana base is built around fetching dual lands to support the deck's color requirements."

With access to card draw, recursion with Snapcaster Mage, and win conditions like Monastery Mentor, the deck seeks to grind out value and ultimately emerge victorious in longer, grindy games."
