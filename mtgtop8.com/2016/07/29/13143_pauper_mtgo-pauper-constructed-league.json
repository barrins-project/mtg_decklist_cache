This archetype focuses on ramping up mana production, using card draw and flicker effects to generate value, and eventually overwhelming the opponent with big creatures and disruptive spells. The deck aims to stall the game early on with defensive spells like Moment's Peace and Sea Gate Oracle, before establishing a dominant board presence with creatures like Peregrine Drake and Mulldrifter."
