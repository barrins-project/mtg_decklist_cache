The deck also includes card draw and lifegain to help maintain card advantage and survive against aggressive strategies. All of this is supported by a mana base designed for consistency and flexibility."

This enables Pyromancer Ascension to double the effectiveness of these spells, while also flipping Thing in the Ice to clear the board. The deck then aims to generate a large storm count with spells like Manamorphose and Lightning Bolt/ Helix to burn the opponent out in a single turn. Remand and Serum Visions provide card selection and disruption to help the deck reach its combo pieces."
