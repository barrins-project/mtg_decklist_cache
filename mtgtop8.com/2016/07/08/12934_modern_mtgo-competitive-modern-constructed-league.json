By discarding cards like Golgari Grave-Troll and Stinkweed Imp, the player can trigger abilities that bring back creatures like Bloodghast and Prized Amalgam. Using cards like Conflagrate and Faithless Looting to further manipulate the graveyard, the player can create explosive turns where they bring back multiple creatures at once. The key strategy is to constantly fill the graveyard with creatures, then bring them back for devastating attacks."

The deck also includes pump spells to make these creatures more powerful and protect them, as well as cards like Gitaxian Probe to keep track of the opponent's hand. By combining these elements, the deck has a strong win condition that can catch opponents off guard and secure victory."
