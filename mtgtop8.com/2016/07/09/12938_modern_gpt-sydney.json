Lingering Souls provides a steady stream of flyers and Abrupt Decay and Path to Exile help deal with opposing threats. The deck aims to apply pressure and close out games efficiently."

The deck includes various cards to help generate mana quickly, protect the combo with counterspells like Pact of Negation, and avoid losing with Angel's Grace and Phyrexian Unlife. The land base is designed to support the combo and maintain consistency with scrying effects and mana sources. The deck aims to quickly assemble its pieces and win before the opponent can disrupt the combo."
