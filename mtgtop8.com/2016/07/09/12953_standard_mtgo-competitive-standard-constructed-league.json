By combining aggressive threats like Knight of the White Orchid and Dragon Hunter with powerful enchantments like Gryff's Boon and Always Watching, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Hanweir Militia Captain further reinforces the theme of building a strong board presence and pushing for early game dominance."
