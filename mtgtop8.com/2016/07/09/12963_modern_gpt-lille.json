The inclusion of Inkmoth Nexus and Blinkmoth Nexus allows for alternate win conditions through infect damage. The deck combines aggressive creatures like Vault Skirge and Signal Pest with resilient threats like Etched Champion for a well-rounded approach to put pressure on opponents. With fast mana generation from Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, the deck can quickly deploy its threats and close out games efficiently."

The deck also includes card draw with Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage, as well as Nahiri, the Harbinger as a win condition. The inclusion of Emrakul, the Aeons Torn provides a powerful late-game threat. The land base includes utility lands like Desolate Lighthouse and Ghost Quarter, along with Celestial Colonnade for additional win conditions."
