By combining low-cost creatures with auras like Ancestral Mask, Armadillo Cloak, and Rancor, the strategy is to create huge threats that are difficult to deal with. The deck also includes mana ramp and life gain cards like Utopia Sprawl and Blossoming Sands to keep the aggression going. The goal is to outpace the opponent with a fast and relentless assault, utilizing the synergy between auras and creatures to dominate the battlefield."
