By deploying threats such as Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Archangel Avacyn alongside support cards like Nissa, Voice of Zendikar and Sylvan Advocate, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and apply pressure. Additional tools such as Dromoka's Command and Declaration in Stone provide removal options, while Evolutionary Leap offers card advantage. The deck also features mana ramp from Oath of Nissa and lands like Canopy Vista and Westvale Abbey."
