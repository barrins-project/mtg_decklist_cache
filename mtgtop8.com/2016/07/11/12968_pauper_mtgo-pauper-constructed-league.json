The deck focuses on controlling the game through counterspells, removal, and card draw, ultimately aiming to overwhelm the opponent with large threats like Mulldrifter and Peregrine Drake. By efficiently managing resources and utilizing powerful synergies like Ghostly Flicker and Mnemonic Wall, this deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a grindy, control-oriented match-up."
