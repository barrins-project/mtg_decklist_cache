            "notes": "The main concept of this UWx Control Legacy deck is to control the board using a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and card advantage engines like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Snapcaster Mage. Utilizing powerful control elements such as Force of Will, Terminus, Counterbalance, and Sensei's Divining Top, the deck aims to control the game and disrupt the opponent's strategy until it can safely resolve game-ending threats like Entreat the Angels. The mana base is designed to support all three colors efficiently to ensure consistency in casting spells."
