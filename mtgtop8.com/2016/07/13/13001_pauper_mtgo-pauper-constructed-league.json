            "notes": "This deck focuses on using cheap spells and creatures to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining pressure through aggressive creatures like Ninja of the Deep Hours and Delver of Secrets. By combining tempo plays with efficient counterspells and card draw, it can quickly overwhelm opponents and maintain advantage throughout the game. The synergy between faeries and spell recursion allows for consistent board presence and disruption, making it a flexible and powerful deck in the Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
