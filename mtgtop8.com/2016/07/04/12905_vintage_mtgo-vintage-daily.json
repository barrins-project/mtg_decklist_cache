            "notes": "The main concept of this deck revolves around the synergy between combo pieces and graveyard manipulation. The key strategy is to use the Dredge mechanic to fill the graveyard with cards like Golgari Grave-Troll and Golgari Thug, which can then be used to trigger abilities of cards like Bridge from Below and Ichorid. This allows the player to generate a large number of zombie tokens and overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Leyline of the Void and Vengeful Pharaoh provide additional control and disruption options, while cards like Cabal Therapy and Force of Will offer protection and disruption against the opponent's strategies."
