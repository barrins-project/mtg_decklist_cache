It utilizes cards like Nissa, Voice of Zendikar and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar to create tokens and boost the team. Dromoka's Command and Declaration in Stone provide removal and disruption. Archangel Avacyn and Gaea's Revenge serve as powerful threats. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy with a mix of dual lands and basic lands. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and efficient aggro strategy."
