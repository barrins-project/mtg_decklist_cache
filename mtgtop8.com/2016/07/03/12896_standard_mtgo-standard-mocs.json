By utilizing cards like Thalia's Lieutenant, Always Watching, and Kytheon, Hero of Akros, the deck aims to build up a strong board presence and put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Cards like Declaration in Stone and Consul's Lieutenant provide additional support and removal options to help maintain board dominance. With a low mana curve and efficient creatures, this deck is designed to consistently apply pressure and win through aggressive tactics."
