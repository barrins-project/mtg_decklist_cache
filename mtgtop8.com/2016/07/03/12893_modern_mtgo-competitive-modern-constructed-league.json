Cards like Golgari Grave-Troll and Stinkweed Imp help accelerate the dredge process, while Faithless Looting and Insolent Neonate help filter through your deck. Conflagrate can be used as a finisher, while Vengeful Pharaoh provides defense against aggressive decks. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm your opponent with a constant stream of threats from your graveyard."
