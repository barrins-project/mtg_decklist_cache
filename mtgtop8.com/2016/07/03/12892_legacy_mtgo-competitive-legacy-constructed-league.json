True-Name Nemesis adds a resilient threat to the board while Ponder and Brainstorm provide card selection and manipulation. Back to Basics can shut down non-basic lands, further controlling the opponent's resources. The inclusion of Sensei's Divining Top helps to set up powerful draws and maximize the effectiveness of the deck's control elements."
