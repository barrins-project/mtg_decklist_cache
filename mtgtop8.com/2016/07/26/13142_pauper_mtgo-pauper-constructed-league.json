It focuses on controlling the board through cards like Moment's Peace and Ghostly Flicker, while also utilizing card draw and recursion to maintain advantage. Peregrine Drake and Mnemonic Wall are used to create infinite mana loops, enabling combos with cards like Capsize or Kaervek's Torch to close out the game quickly. The deck aims to outvalue opponents by efficiently managing its resources and overwhelming them with its late-game threats."
