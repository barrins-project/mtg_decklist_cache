The deck utilizes cards like Crop Rotation, Sylvan Scrying, and Into the North to search for Dark Depths, while also running ways to protect the combo such as Not of This World. The deck also includes disruption elements like Thoughtseize, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Duress to control the opponent's hand and prevent them from stopping the combo. Overall, the deck aims to win the game through a powerful and fast combo while disrupting the opponent's game plan."

The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan, using cards like Counterbalance and Force of Will to prevent threats from hitting the battlefield. Sensei's Divining Top and Brainstorm allow the player to dig through their deck for the right answers, while Jace, the Mind Sculptor helps to control the board and provide card advantage. The deck also includes win conditions like Entreat the Angels and Snapcaster Mage to close out the game."
