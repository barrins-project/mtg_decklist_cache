By gaining life and controlling the board with removal spells like Path to Exile, the deck aims to stall out the game until it can drop powerful threats like Archangel of Thune and overwhelm the opponent with a massive life total and powerful creatures. It focuses on aggressive plays while also maintaining a resilient board presence."
