It utilizes cards like Mana Leak, Condescend, and Rewind to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also using Akroma's Vengeance and Wrath of God to clear the board when necessary. Renewed Faith and Eternal Dragon provide some life gain and card advantage, while Decree of Justice can create an army of tokens. The mana base ensures consistent access to both blue and white mana sources to support the control strategy."

Akroma's Vengeance and Wrath of God provide additional board wipes for stabilization. The deck also has some lifegain synergy with Pulse of the Fields and Renewed Faith. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue and outlast the opponent through efficient card advantage and board control."
