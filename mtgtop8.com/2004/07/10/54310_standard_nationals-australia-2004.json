The deck aims to be fast and efficient in dealing damage while still having some removal and utility cards like Oxidize and Electrostatic Bolt to handle threats from the opponent. With a focus on Goblin tribal synergy and haste granting cards, the deck seeks to apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game."
