It focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with aggressive goblin creatures and controlling the board with removal spells. The deck has a strong tribal theme and aims to set up explosive turns with cards like Siege-Gang Commander and Skirk Prospector. The goal is to create a swarm of goblins that can quickly deal damage to the opponent and finish them off before they can mount a defense."
