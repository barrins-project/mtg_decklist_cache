The deck uses cards like Mana Leak and Rewind to counter the opponent's spells, Wrath of God and Akroma's Vengeance to wipe their board, and Thirst for Knowledge for card draw. The inclusion of cards like Mindslaver and Duplicant provides additional utility and flexibility in dealing with threats. Coastal Tower and Flooded Strand help with mana fixing and ramp, allowing the deck to reach its late-game win conditions."
