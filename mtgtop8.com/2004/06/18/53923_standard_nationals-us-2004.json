The deck aims to control the game by utilizing efficient creatures like Ravenous Baloth and Molder Slug while using removal spells like Starstorm and Electrostatic Bolt to clear the opponent's threats. The deck also utilizes ramp spells like Birds of Paradise and Vine Trellis to accelerate its mana production and cast its threats ahead of schedule. Ultimately, the deck aims to overwhelm and overrun the opponent before they can set up their own game plan."
