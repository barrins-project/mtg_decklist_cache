            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to apply pressure early on with aggressive creatures like Tarmogoyf and Deathrite Shaman, while disrupting the opponent's gameplan with hand disruption like Thoughtseize and Hymn to Tourach. The deck is also capable of controlling the board with removal spells like Punishing Fire and Abrupt Decay. The mana base is designed to support a mix of black, red, and green spells, with lands like Grove of the Burnwillows and Wasteland providing additional utility. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent quickly while maintaining control of the game through disruption and removal."

The key strategy involves using Sensei's Divining Top and Counterbalance to manipulate the top card of the library and counter spells of the same converted mana cost. Utilizing powerful card draw and selection effects like Brainstorm and Ponder, the deck aims to consistently find answers and threats while managing the board with cards like Terminus and Swords to Plowshares. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional card advantage and win conditions, with Entreat the Angels offering a powerful late-game threat."
