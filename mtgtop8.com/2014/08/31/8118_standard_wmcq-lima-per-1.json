The deck focuses on disruption and removal spells combined with resilient threats such as Desecration Demon and Blood Baron of Vizkopa to control the board and put pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of Planeswalkers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion provides additional versatility and threats. Ultimately, the deck aims to curve out efficiently and out-value the opponent in a 1 vs 1 match."

The deck focuses on playing efficient and powerful creatures, such as Loxodon Smiter, Fleecemane Lion, and Voice of Resurgence, which can quickly apply pressure to the opponent's life total. The deck also includes cards like Call of the Conclave, Selesnya Charm, and Advent of the Wurm to generate additional creatures and maintain a strong board presence. Ajani, Caller of the Pride provides additional utility and potential for powerful swings. The deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize or mount a strong defense."
