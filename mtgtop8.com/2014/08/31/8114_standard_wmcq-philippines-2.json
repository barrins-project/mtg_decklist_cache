By using cards like Dissolve, Supreme Verdict, Detention Sphere, and Last Breath, the deck aims to maintain board control and stall the game until it can stabilize and win through powerful late-game threats such as Aetherling, Elspeth, Sun's Champion, and Sphinx's Revelation for card advantage. The deck's goal is to outlast the opponent and win through incremental advantage."
