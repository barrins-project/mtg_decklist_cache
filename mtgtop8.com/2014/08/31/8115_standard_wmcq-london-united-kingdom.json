By playing efficient creatures like Young Pyromancer and Chandra's Phoenix, along with a mix of burn spells like Lightning Strike and Boros Charm, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Searing Blood and Skullcrack further punishes the opponent for trying to stabilize. The mana base is optimized for consistent casting of spells, ensuring a steady stream of threats and burn spells to pressure the opponent."
