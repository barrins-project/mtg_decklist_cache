This control strategy is supported by powerful removal spells like Terminus, Swords to Plowshares, and Council's Judgment, as well as countermagic such as Force of Will and Spell Pierce. The deck also has finishers in Entreat the Angels and Vendilion Clique to seal the deal once you have seized control of the game."
