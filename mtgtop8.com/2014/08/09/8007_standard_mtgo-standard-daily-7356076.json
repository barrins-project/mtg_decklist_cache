            "notes": "The main concept of this Golgari Aggro deck is to quickly fill the graveyard with creatures and then utilize cards like Grisly Salvage and Nyx Weaver to bring them back to the battlefield. Lotleth Troll and Nighthowler work well together to create powerful threats, while cards like Herald of Torment and Shadowborn Demon provide additional aggression. The use of Whip of Erebos allows for repeated creature reanimation, while Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord can finish off opponents by sacrificing large creatures. Overall, the deck focuses on aggressive plays and graveyard recursion to overwhelm opponents."
