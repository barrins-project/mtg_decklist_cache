Card advantage is gained through draw spells like Divination and Jace, Architect of Thought, while also gaining life and denying attacks with Azorius Charm. The win condition is to generate card advantage and mana with Sphinx's Revelation and eventually overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Elspeth, Sun's Champion."
