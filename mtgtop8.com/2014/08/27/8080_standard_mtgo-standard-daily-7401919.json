The inclusion of pack Rat also provides a potential win condition if left unchecked."

By using cards like Pack Rat, Nightveil Specter, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, and Desecration Demon, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and drain their life total. With a mix of removal spells and card draw engines like Underworld Connections, the deck can control the board while maintaining a steady stream of threats. The inclusion of Mutavault and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth helps to ensure consistent mana production for the deck's powerful black spells."
