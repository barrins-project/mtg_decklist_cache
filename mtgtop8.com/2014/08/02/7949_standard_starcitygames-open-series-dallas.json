            "notes": "The core strategy of the deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive playstyle, utilizing a combination of powerful creatures and mana-efficient spells. By curving out early with efficient creatures like Experiment One and Soldier of the Pantheon, and later dropping threats like Fleecemane Lion and Loxodon Smiter, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent and close out the game quickly. Support cards like Selesnya Charm and Banishing Light help to deal with opposing threats, while Ajani, Caller of the Pride provides additional reach and resilience."
