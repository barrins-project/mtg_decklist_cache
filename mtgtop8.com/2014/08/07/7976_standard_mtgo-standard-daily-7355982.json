By drawing cards and gaining life with cards like Sphinx's Revelation and Azorius Charm, the player can outvalue the opponent in the late game. The win condition of the deck is to eventually play powerful planeswalkers like Jace, Architect of Thought and Elspeth, Sun's Champion to maintain board presence and secure the victory. The deck aims to control the game tempo until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful late-game cards."

The deck aims to generate card advantage with Underworld Connections and pack Rat, and close out the game with powerful finishers like Obzedat, Ghost Council, Blood Baron of Vizkopa, and Elspeth, Sun's Champion. The deck prioritizes controlling the board and resources of the opponent while establishing a strong and resilient board presence of its own."
