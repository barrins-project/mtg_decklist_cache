Using cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, the deck can easily cast multiple spells in a turn, creating a high-tempo strategy that can win games in the early turns. Additionally, the deck has a strong affinity for artifacts, allowing for explosive plays and synergy between its cards."

The main strategy is to be relentless in attacking and burning the opponent down as quickly as possible."
