By using cards like Hero's Downfall, Abrupt Decay, and Mizzium Mortars to deal with threats, along with cards like Courser of Kruphix and Sylvan Caryatid to generate value, the deck aims to outlast opponents and take over the game with powerful cards like Xenagos, the Reveler, Nissa, Worldwaker, and Chandra, Pyromaster. The deck also utilizes a mix of black, red, and green mana sources to cast its spells efficiently."
