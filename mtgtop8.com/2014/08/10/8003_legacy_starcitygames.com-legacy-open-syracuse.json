The primary win condition is to put powerful creatures like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Griselbrand into play with Sneak Attack or Through the Breach, overwhelming the opponent with their immense power. Despite being mono-red, the deck has the potential to win games quickly with its explosive plays."
