Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of aggressive creatures and burn spells."

Additionally, Purphoros, God of the Forge can act as a win condition by dealing damage to the opponent each time a creature enters the battlefield. The deck also utilizes mana ramp (Elvish Mystic, Sylvan Caryatid) to quickly play its high-cost spells and creatures."
