By utilizing cards like Desecration Demon, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, and Nightveil Specter, along with support from Pack Rat and removal spells like Devour Flesh and Hero's Downfall, the deck aims to quickly drain the opponent's life total. With the added card advantage from Thoughtseize and Underworld Connections, along with mana acceleration from Mutavault and Temple of Malady, the deck seeks to establish board presence and close out the game efficiently."
