By using cards with high black mana symbols for devotion, the player can maximize the effects of cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Erebos, God of the Dead. The deck also includes disruption cards like Thoughtseize and removal spells like Hero's Downfall to control the board and protect its creatures. The strategy is to apply pressure early and maintain a steady stream of threats to close out the game efficiently."
