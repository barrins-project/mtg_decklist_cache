By ramping up mana with Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Burning-Tree Emissary, the deck aims to flood the board with aggressive creatures like Fanatic of Mogis and Stormbreath Dragon to deal damage to the opponent quickly. Cards like Purphoros, God of the Forge and Hammer of Purphoros provide additional damage and utility, while Chandra, Pyromaster helps with card advantage. Chained to the Rocks and Mizzium Mortars offer removal options to control the board and secure victory."
