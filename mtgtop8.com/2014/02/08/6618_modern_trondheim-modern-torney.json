This enables the player to control the game by playing powerful threats like Karn Liberated, Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre, and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn. The deck also includes removal spells like Pyroclasm and Oblivion Stone to deal with opposing threats, as well as ways to search for the UrzaTron pieces and other key cards. Overall, the strategy revolves around ramping up mana and casting game-winning threats."

The use of protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing help to ensure that the infect creatures can get through and deal damage successfully. The deck also includes some disruption with Beast Within to handle opposing threats."
