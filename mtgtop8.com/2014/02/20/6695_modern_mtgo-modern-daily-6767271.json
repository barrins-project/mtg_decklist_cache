By utilizing cards like Serum Visions and Gitaxian Probe for card draw and selection, as well as Remand and Cryptic Command for counterspells and tempo advantage, the deck aims to keep the opponent off-balance while attacking with evasive threats like Delver of Secrets and Ninja of the Deep Hours. Mutavault provides additional creature pressure, while Snapcaster Mage allows for recursion of key spells. Island serves as the primary mana source for this blue-heavy deck."
