These creatures are supported by powerful enchantments like Thassa, God of the Sea and Detention Sphere, providing both disruption and card advantage. The inclusion of versatile spells like Rapid Hybridization and control elements like Tidebinder Mage allow for flexibility in dealing with various threats, while also maintaining pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a consistent stream of threats backed up by a solid mana base."
