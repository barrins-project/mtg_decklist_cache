By playing a mix of control cards such as Detention Sphere and Supreme Verdict, along with powerful planeswalkers like Jace and Elspeth, the deck aims to stabilize the board and gain card advantage with spells like Sphinx's Revelation. The inclusion of Thoughtseize also allows for disruption of the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck focuses on outvaluing the opponent and grinding out a win through attrition."
