The key strategy involves using cards like Dissolve and Syncopate to counter threats, Detention Sphere to remove problematic permanents, and Sphinx's Revelation to draw cards and gain life. The win condition of this deck is usually Aetherling or Elspeth, Sun's Champion, which can close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted."
