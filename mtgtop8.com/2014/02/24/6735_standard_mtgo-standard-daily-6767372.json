            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy using a combination of cheap creature spells, evasion abilities, and control elements. By playing creatures like Frostburn Weird, Judge's Familiar, and Nightveil Specter early on, the deck aims to establish board presence quickly and apply pressure to the opponent. Thassa, God of the Sea provides additional card selection and evasion, while Master of Waves generates a wide board of elemental tokens. Tidebinder Mage and Domestication help to control the opponent's threats, allowing for a clear path to victory."
