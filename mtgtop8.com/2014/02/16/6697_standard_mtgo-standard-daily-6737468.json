By disrupting their hand with cards like Thoughtseize and Lifebane Zombie, and removing threats with removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Bile Blight, the deck aims to maintain board control and pressure the opponent's life total. Mogis's Marauder and Herald of Torment provide additional reach and evasion to close out games swiftly. The inclusion of Mutavault adds versatility and additional threats to the deck."
