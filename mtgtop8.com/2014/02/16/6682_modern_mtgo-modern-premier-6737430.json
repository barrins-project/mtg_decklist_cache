By searching for lands with cards like Search for Tomorrow and Farseek, the deck aims to get to seven or more lands in play, then cast Scapeshift to sacrifice those lands and bring in multiple copies of Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle to deal lethal damage to the opponent. Key cards like Primeval Titan and Prismatic Omen help set up this combo quickly and efficiently."

By giving the creatures hexproof, the opponent has limited options for removal, allowing the player to consistently deal damage and win the game quickly. Additionally, the deck contains cards that draw additional cards or provide card advantage to maintain a strong board presence. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive strategy with a balance of untapped dual lands and fetch lands."
