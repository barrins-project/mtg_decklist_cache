By using powerful planeswalkers like Jace, Architect of Thought and Elspeth, Sun's Champion, along with win conditions like Aetherling and Sphinx's Revelation for card advantage, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with threats while preventing them from establishing their own board presence. With a mix of creature removal, counterspells, and card advantage, this Esper Control deck is designed to grind out victories through attrition."
