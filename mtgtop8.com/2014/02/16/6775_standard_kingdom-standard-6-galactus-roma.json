The key strategy is to survive until the late game where powerful planeswalkers like Elspeth and Jace can take over the game. The deck also utilizes tempo plays like Azorius Charm and Detention Sphere to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through incremental advantage and powerful late-game threats."
