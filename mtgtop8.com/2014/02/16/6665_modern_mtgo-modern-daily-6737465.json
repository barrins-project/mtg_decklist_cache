The deck aims to outpace opponents and win the game before they can set up their own defenses or removal. It relies on efficient mana usage and careful decision-making in choosing which auras to play."

By using cards like Leonin Arbiter and Aven Mindcensor to restrict the opponent's search abilities and land drops, along with cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to tax their spells, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's development. This allows the aggressive creatures like Loxodon Smiter and Mirran Crusader to quickly close out the game. Additionally, cards like Worship and Sword of Light and Shadow provide resilience and card advantage to help maintain the pressure."
