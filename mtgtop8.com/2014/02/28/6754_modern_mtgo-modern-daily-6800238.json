By utilizing cards like Steel Overseer and Arcbound Ravager to buff up your creatures, you can deal large amounts of damage quickly. Additionally, cards like Inkmoth Nexus can provide alternate win conditions. The deck also includes utility cards like Spellskite and Welding Jar to protect your key pieces. The goal is to establish a strong board presence early in the game and maintain pressure throughout."
