The deck aims to control the board with cards like Detention Sphere and Supreme Verdict, while generating card advantage through Sphinx's Revelation and Jace, Architect of Thought. Warleader's Helix provides additional removal and lifegain, while counterspells like Counterflux help protect key threats. The deck also includes some card draw and board wipes to ensure it can outlast opposing strategies."
