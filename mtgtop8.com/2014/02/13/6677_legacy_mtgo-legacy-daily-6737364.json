            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to use a mixture of creature threats, disruption spells, and card advantage to control the game and outvalue the opponent. By utilizing cards like Shardless Agent, Liliana of the Veil, and Ancestral Vision for card advantage, along with strong creatures like Tarmogoyf and Baleful Strix, the deck can apply pressure while keeping the opponent on the back foot. The deck also packs a fair amount of disruption with cards like Force of Will, Abrupt Decay, and Hymn to Tourach to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain control of the board."
