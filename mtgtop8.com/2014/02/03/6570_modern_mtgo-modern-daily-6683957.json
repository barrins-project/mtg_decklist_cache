The key strategy is to protect the creature with hexproof by attaching multiple auras to it, making it difficult for the opponent to remove or block. By constantly buffing up the creature with auras, the deck aims to outpace the opponent and deal lethal damage before they can mount a defense. This aggressive strategy relies on quickly building up a powerful threat that the opponent struggles to deal with effectively."
