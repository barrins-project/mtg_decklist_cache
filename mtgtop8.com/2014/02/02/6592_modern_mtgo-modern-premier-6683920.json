By utilizing cards like Aether Vial and Lord of Atlantis, the deck aims to build a strong board presence quickly and overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of merfolk. Additionally, the inclusion of Master of Waves and Mothdust Changeling provides a way to create an army of elemental tokens which can quickly end the game. The deck is designed to be fast, efficient, and resilient against removal spells."
