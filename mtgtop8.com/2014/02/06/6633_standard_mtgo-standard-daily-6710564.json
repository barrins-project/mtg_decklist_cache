It also utilizes creatures like Scavenging Ooze and Pack Rat to apply pressure and generate card advantage. Vraska the Unseen serves as a game-ending threat that can take out problematic permanents. The mana base allows for consistent access to both green and black mana sources. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent by efficiently dealing with threats and maintaining board presence."
