            "notes": "The focus of this UW Control deck is to stall the game early on using counter spells and removal, before stabilizing with powerful card draw and board-clearing spells. Several win conditions are included in the form of planeswalkers and Sphinx's Revelation, allowing the player to out-value their opponent in the late game. The mana base is optimized for consistent access to both white and blue mana sources, while also providing utility in the form of Mutavault. This deck aims to control the pace of the game and overwhelm the opponent with superior card advantage and board presence."
