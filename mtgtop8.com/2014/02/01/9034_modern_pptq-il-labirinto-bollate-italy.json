The deck focuses on ramping up mana with cards like Search for Tomorrow and Sakura-Tribe Elder while disrupting the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Cryptic Command and Remand. The win condition is to sacrifice lands with Scapeshift to trigger Valakut's ability and deal massive damage to the opponent."

The inclusion of Lingering Souls provides additional threats and makes it difficult for opponents to deal with multiple flying tokens. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's three-color strategy and ensure consistent casting of spells."
