The high number of low-cost creatures and removal spells allows for a fast-paced and relentless assault, aiming to secure victory before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

Ghor-Clan Rampager and Domri Rade provide additional aggression and removal options, while Xenagos, the Reveler and Chandra, Pyromaster offer additional mana and card advantage. The deck also includes disruption with Scavenging Ooze and removal with Mizzium Mortars, creating a fast-paced and aggressive strategy focused on beating down the opponent quickly."
