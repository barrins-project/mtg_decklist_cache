By using cards like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall to disrupt the opponent's strategy, along with aggressive creatures like Pack Rat and Desecration Demon, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly. The deck also utilizes cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel to gain life and deal damage while maintaining card advantage with Underworld Connections. By utilizing various removal spells and efficient creatures, this deck focuses on maintaining early aggression and pressure to secure victory."
