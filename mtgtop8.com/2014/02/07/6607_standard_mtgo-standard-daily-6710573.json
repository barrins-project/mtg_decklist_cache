With a heavy devotion to black, cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel are key in draining the opponent's life total and securing the win. Mutavault provides additional creature threats while Underworld Connections provides card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and powerful removal spells."
