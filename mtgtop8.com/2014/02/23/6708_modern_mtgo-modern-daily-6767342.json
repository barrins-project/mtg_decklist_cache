The deck aims to survive the early game through efficient removal like Lightning Bolt and Path to Exile, while setting up card advantage with cards like Sphinx's Revelation and Snapcaster Mage. Cryptic Command serves as a versatile control spell to counter threats or draw cards, while cards like Wrath of God and Supreme Verdict provide board wipes as a reset button. The deck's win condition comes from powerful planeswalkers like Gideon Jura and Ajani Vengeant, backed up by creature lands like Celestial Colonnade."
