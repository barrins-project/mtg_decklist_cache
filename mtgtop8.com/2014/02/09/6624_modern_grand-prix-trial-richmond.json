The deck combines aggressive creatures like Signal Pest and Vault Skirge with powerful artifacts like Cranial Plating and Steel Overseer to create a fast, threatening board presence. By maintaining a high artifact count and utilizing cards like Springleaf Drum and Mox Opal, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of speed and power."
