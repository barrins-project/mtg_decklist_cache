By playing aggressive creatures like Pack Rat, Nightveil Specter, and Desecration Demon, along with removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Devour Flesh, the deck aims to outpace and overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Underworld Connections provide additional advantages by draining life or drawing extra cards. The mana base is also built to support the deck's strategy with lands like Temple of Deceit and Mutavault."
