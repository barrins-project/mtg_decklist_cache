The deck aims to quickly establish a strong board presence and close out the game with powerful finishers like Obzedat, Ghost Council and Desecration Demon. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver and Whip of Erebos provides additional utility and resilience against opposing threats."
