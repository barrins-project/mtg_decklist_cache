By utilizing cards like Pack Rat, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, and Desecration Demon, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats while disrupting their game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall. The deck also includes card draw and life gain to maintain resources and outvalue the opponent in the long run. The mana base is focused on supporting the devotion to black strategy, with Mutavault providing additional threats."
