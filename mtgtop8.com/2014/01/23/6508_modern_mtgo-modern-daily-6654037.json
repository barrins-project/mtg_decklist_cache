The deck also includes control elements such as Karn Liberated, Oblivion Stone, and Pyroclasm to handle opposing threats. Additionally, cards like Ancient Stirrings, Expedition Map, and Sylvan Scrying help to find specific lands or threats quickly. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game while ramping into powerful late-game threats."

Snapcaster Mage provides versatility by allowing the player to reuse important spells from the graveyard. The deck aims to establish early dominance on the battlefield and maintain tempo with counterspells like Remand and Spell Pierce. This UR Aggro deck excels at applying pressure while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
