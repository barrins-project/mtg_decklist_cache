The deck accomplishes this by ramping up quickly with cards like Utopia Sprawl, Arbor Elf, and Noble Hierarch. It also has a toolbox aspect with Knight of the Reliquary and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben to disrupt opponents and find specific answers. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful creatures like Terastodon and Primeval Titan, while utilizing cards like Summoning Trap and Mosswort Bridge to cheat them into play for additional value."
