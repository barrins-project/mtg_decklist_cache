It utilizes burn spells such as Lightning Strike and Magma Jet to control the board and finish off opponents quickly. Chained to the Rocks provides removal for bigger threats, while cards like Young Pyromancer and Chandra, Pyromaster generate additional value. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of creatures and burn spells while maintaining pressure throughout the game."
