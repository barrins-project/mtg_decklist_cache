            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly putting pressure on the opponent with efficient creatures that can hit the battlefield early and mid-game. It also includes cards that can protect your creatures from removal and generate additional value, such as Selesnya Charm and Detention Sphere. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy while also having the flexibility to handle any threats that may come your way. The mana base is built to support a smooth curve and ensure you can consistently play your powerful spells."

The win condition comes from resolving powerful spells like Sphinx's Revelation and Elspeth, Sun's Champion. By carefully managing resources and outlasting the opponent, this deck aims to control the game until it can win with a combination of threats and card advantage."
