The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Mizzium Mortars and Chained to the Rocks before finishing off the opponent with powerful creatures like Stormbreath Dragon and Purphoros, God of the Forge. Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Chandra, Pyromaster provide additional threats and card advantage to maintain pressure on the opponent."
