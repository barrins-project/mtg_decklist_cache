By utilizing cards like Pack Rat, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, and Desecration Demon, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence and drain the opponent's life total. The inclusion of cards like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan while cards like Underworld Connections provide card advantage. This deck seeks to maintain pressure on the opponent and establish control of the game through a strong devotion to black."
