By including powerful red planeswalkers like Chandra and Elspeth, as well as enchantments like Purphoros, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm opponents with damage and board control. The inclusion of Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx allows for explosive mana generation to cast high-cost spells like Stormbreath Dragon. Overall, the deck focuses on fast-paced, aggressive gameplay centered around devotion to the color red."
