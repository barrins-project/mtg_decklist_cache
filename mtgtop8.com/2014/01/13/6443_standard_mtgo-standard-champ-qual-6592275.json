By utilizing cards like Chained to the Rocks as removal and Chandra, Pyromaster for card advantage, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent while controlling the board. With a mix of efficient creatures like Rakdos Cackler and Chandra's Phoenix, alongside burn spells like Shock and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
