The deck aims to use a variety of versatile spells such as Cryptic Command, Lightning Bolt, and Snapcaster Mage to control the pace of the game and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Cards like Sphinx's Revelation and Ajani Vengeant provide additional card advantage and life gain to help the player stabilize. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Celestial Colonnade and Gideon Jura to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted."
