The win condition is Aetherling, a hard-to-interact-with threat that can quickly close out the game. The mana base is designed to support the deck's need for both white and blue mana sources. Overall, the strategy revolves around outlasting opponents and slowly building up card advantage until the player can secure a victory."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's hand with Thoughtseize and gain card advantage with Underworld Connections. It also includes removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Pharika's Cure to control the board. Pack Rat provides a strong repeatable threat, while Nightveil Specter generates card advantage and Desecration Demon puts pressure on the opponent. The deck's mana base includes temples for scrying and Mutavault for additional creature threats."
