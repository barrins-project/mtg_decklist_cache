It includes a mix of efficient creatures like Boros Reckoner and Burning-Tree Emissary, along with removal spells like Chained to the Rocks and Mizzium Mortars to clear the way for attacks. The mana base includes Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx to ramp up devotion and generate extra mana for big plays, while also including lands like Sacred Foundry and Temple of Triumph for consistency."
