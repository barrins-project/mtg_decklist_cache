By utilizing low-cost creatures like Cloudfin Raptor and Nightveil Specter, along with powerful enchantments like Thassa, God of the Sea and Bident of Thassa, the deck aims to outpace the opponent and maintain a consistent presence on the battlefield. Additional disruption and removal spells such as Rapid Hybridization and Cyclonic Rift help to deal with threats and clear the way for attacks. The inclusion of Mutavault and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx provide additional utility and mana ramp options for the deck's strategy."
