By playing low-cost creatures like Firedrinker Satyr and Rakdos Cackler alongside powerful burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Cards like Chandra's Phoenix and Boros Reckoner provide additional damage and resilience, while Mutavault can be used for additional creature attacks. Overall, the strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent and burn them out before they have a chance to stabilize."
