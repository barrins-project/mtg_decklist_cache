            "notes": "This deck focuses on maintaining a fast-paced aggressive strategy using creatures with various abilities to control the board and deal consistent damage to the opponent. The key concept revolves around establishing an early presence with low-cost creatures like Cloudfin Raptor and Judge's Familiar, while leveraging powerful enchantments like Thassa, God of the Sea and Bident of Thassa to enable card draw and further board control. The inclusion of cards like Master of Waves and Mutavault also provides additional threats and resilience to removal spells."
