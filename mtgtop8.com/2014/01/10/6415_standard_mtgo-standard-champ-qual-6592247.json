Utilizing cards like Pack Rat and Gray Merchant of Asphodel to quickly drain opponent's life totals and generate advantage. The deck also includes disruption with Thoughseize and removal spells like Hero's Downfall. Underworld Connections provides card draw to maintain resources, while Desecration Demon serves as a threatening finisher. Key cards like Erebos, God of the Dead and Mutavault further enhance the deck's strategy, making it a potent and efficient Aggro deck with strong black devotion synergy."
