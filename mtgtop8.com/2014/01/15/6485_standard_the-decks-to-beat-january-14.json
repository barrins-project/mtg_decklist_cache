The deck aims to stabilize the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Detention Sphere, while generating card advantage through Sphinx's Revelation and Jace, Architect of Thought. It also has some versatile utility cards like Azorius Charm and Quicken to deal with threats and manipulate the game in its favor. The win condition is to overpower the opponent with card advantage and eventually close out the game with a large Sphinx's Revelation or Elspeth, Sun's Champion."
