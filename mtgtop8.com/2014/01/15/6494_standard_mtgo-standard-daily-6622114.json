It utilizes disruption cards like Detention Sphere and Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver to slow down the opponent's game plan. Obzedat, Ghost Council and Desecration Demon provide powerful threats that are hard to deal with. The deck also includes some lifegain and graveyard recursion with Whip of Erebos and Far/Away. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and disrupt the opponent's strategy to secure a win."
