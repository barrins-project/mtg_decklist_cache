The deck aims to control the board early on with counterspells like Syncopate and Dissolve, while also providing tempo swings with cards like Cyclonic Rift. With fast and efficient creatures like Skylasher, Shambleshark, and Briarpack Alpha, along with the versatility of Simic Charm, the deck looks to overwhelm the opponent and secure a swift victory. Additionally, the inclusion of draw spells like Opportunity helps to maintain card advantage and keep up the pressure."
