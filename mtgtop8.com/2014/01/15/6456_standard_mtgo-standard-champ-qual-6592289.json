It focuses on stalling the game until it can drop powerful finishers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion to close out the game. The deck also includes efficient removal spells like Supreme Verdict and Detention Sphere to deal with threats on the board. The mana base is built solidly for consistency with a mix of temples and shock lands."
