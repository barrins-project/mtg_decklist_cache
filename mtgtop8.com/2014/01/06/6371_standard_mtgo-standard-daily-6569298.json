By using cards like Soldier of the Pantheon and Xathrid Necromancer to apply early pressure, backed up by efficient removal like Doom Blade and Detention Sphere, the deck aims to control the board while continually applying pressure. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Obzedat, Ghost Council and Whip of Erebos provides additional late-game threats and life gain to outlast opponents in longer matchups."
