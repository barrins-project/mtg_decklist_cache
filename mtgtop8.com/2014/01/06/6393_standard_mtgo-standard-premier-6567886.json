Additionally, cards like Imposing Sovereign can slow down your opponent's game plan, giving you the edge. With removal spells like Detention Sphere and Supreme Verdict, you can deal with any threats your opponent may have. And cards like Desecration Demon and Obzedat, Ghost Council provide powerful finishers to seal the game."
