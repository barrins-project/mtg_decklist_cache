By maximizing black mana symbols in the deck, cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel become more powerful. The main strategy is to apply constant pressure with efficient creatures like Desecration Demon and Pack Rat, while using removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Devour Flesh to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Thoughtseize helps to further disrupt the opponent's hand while Underworld Connections provides card advantage."
