The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient creatures and combat tricks, while also maintaining a solid mana base to ensure consistent deployment of threats. The inclusion of Ajani, Caller of the Pride provides additional reach and a potential finisher to close out games quickly."
