The inclusion of cards like Tidebinder Mage and Cyclonic Rift provides tempo advantage, while Nightveil Specter helps generate card advantage. The deck also has some control elements with Jace, Architect of Thought and Bident of Thassa, allowing it to maintain pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan."
