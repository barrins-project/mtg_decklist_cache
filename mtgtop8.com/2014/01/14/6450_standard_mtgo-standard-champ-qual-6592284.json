The deck aims to stabilize the battlefield using board wipes like Supreme Verdict and removal spells like Detention Sphere, while generating card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation and Jace, Architect of Thought. With control over the board, the deck can then close out the game with powerful finishers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Aetherling. The land base is focused on ensuring consistency and fixing mana for the control spells."
