The inclusion of utility lands like Maze of Ith and Karakas provide additional protection and flexibility, making the deck a formidable force in a Legacy 1 vs 1 format."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Force of Will while also setting up its combo pieces with cards like Entomb and Careful Study. Show and Tell can also provide another way to put powerful creatures into play, giving the deck multiple paths to victory through its reanimation strategy."
