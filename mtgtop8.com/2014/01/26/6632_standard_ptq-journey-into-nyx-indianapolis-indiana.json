With a mix of hand disruption, removal, and card draw, the strategy is to control the board while steadily increasing the amount of black mana symbols on the battlefield to maximize the effectiveness of key cards. The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board presence throughout the game to secure a quick victory."
