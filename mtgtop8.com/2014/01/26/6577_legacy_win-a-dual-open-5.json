By using cards like Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play, along with disruptive spells like Force of Will and Daze to protect your board, you can quickly build up a force of Merfolk creatures that buff each other and provide ways to tap down your opponent's creatures. The deck aims to apply pressure consistently throughout the game and close out matches before the opponent can stabilize."
