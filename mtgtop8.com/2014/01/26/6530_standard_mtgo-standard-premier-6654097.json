Ghor-Clan Rampager and other combat tricks can help push through damage and close out the game swiftly. Domri Rade and Xenagos, the Reveler provide additional support and card advantage, while cards like Scavenging Ooze and Witchstalker offer resilience against opposing strategies. Overall, the deck aims to establish board presence quickly and maintain pressure throughout the game."

Additionally, cards like Frostburn Weird and Boros Reckoner provide additional firepower and defensive capabilities, while cards like Chained to the Rocks and Mizzium Mortars help control the board and clear the opponent's threats. Ultimately, the goal is to deal quick and decisive damage to the opponent."
