By playing defensively and efficiently managing resources, the deck aims to stall until it can stabilize the board and generate card advantage with cards like Sphinx's Revelation and Jace, Architect of Thought. The win condition is to either overwhelm the opponent with powerful planeswalkers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion or to grind them out through attrition with repeated board wipes and card advantage."
