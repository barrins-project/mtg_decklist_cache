By using cards like Tidebinder Mage, Cloudfin Raptor, and Frostburn Weird, the deck aims to establish early board presence and pressure the opponent. Thassa, God of the Sea and Master of Waves provide additional value and resilience to the deck, while cards like Cyclonic Rift and Rapid Hybridization offer ways to disrupt the opponent's game plan. With a heavy focus on blue mana sources, this Mono Blue Aggro deck aims to win fast and decisively."
