The inclusion of Whip of Erebos provides lifelink and recursion for the creatures, while cards like Ultimate Price and Doom Blade offer additional removal options. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the three-color combination of Esper."

The deck also includes synergy with sacrifice effects like Cartel Aristocrat and Whip of Erebos, allowing for additional value and flexibility in combat. Additionally, the land base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize consistency."
