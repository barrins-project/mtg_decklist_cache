By utilizing cards like Leonin Arbiter, Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, and Aven Mindcensor, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's mana base and prevent them from smoothly executing their game plan. The deck also includes powerful creatures like Mirran Crusader and Hero of Bladehold to quickly end the game once the opponent's resources have been sufficiently depleted. This combination of disruption and aggression makes it difficult for opponents to effectively respond to the deck's threats."
