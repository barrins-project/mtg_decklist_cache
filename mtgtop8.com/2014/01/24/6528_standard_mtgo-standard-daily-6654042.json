The deck focuses on playing threats like Pack Rat, Desecration Demon, and Blood Baron of Vizkopa to pressure the opponent while staying ahead with card advantage from Underworld Connections. The deck also includes a mix of spot removal and board wipes to control the opponent's threats, as well as versatile lands to fix mana and provide additional utility. The overall strategy is to outvalue the opponent and grind out a win through attrition."
