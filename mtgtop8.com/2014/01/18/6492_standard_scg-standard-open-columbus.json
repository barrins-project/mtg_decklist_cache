With card advantage engines like Underworld Connections and Temple of Silence, the deck aims to outvalue opponents and maintain a strong defensive position. Elspeth, Sun's Champion provides a win condition and additional board presence, while Thoughtseize helps disrupt the opponent's game plan. Ratchet Bomb and Ultimate Price offer additional removal options to maintain control of the game."
