By casting multiple devotion creatures such as Fanatic of Mogis and Ash Zealot, the deck aims to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent quickly. The inclusion of powerful red devotion cards like Purphoros, God of the Forge and Stormbreath Dragon further enhances the deck's aggressive strategy. Additionally, cards like Chained to the Rocks and Mizzium Mortars help control the opponent's board while maintaining pressure."
