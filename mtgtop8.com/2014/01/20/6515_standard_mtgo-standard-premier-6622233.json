The key strategy is to maintain board control using removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Devour Flesh while also draining the opponent's life total using Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Blood Baron of Vizkopa. The deck also utilizes card advantage and lifegain from Underworld Connections and Whip of Erebos to outvalue the opponent in grindy matchups. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a strong presence on the battlefield and efficient removal."
