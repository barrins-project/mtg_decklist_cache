            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent quickly with aggressive creatures and disruptive spells while utilizing the power of mono blue spells. By combining creatures with abilities like unblockable and card advantage with powerful tribal effects, the deck aims to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent efficiently. Additionally, the inclusion of Mutavault allows for additional creature versatility and potential damage output. The overall strategy revolves around quickly establishing a strong board presence and outpacing the opponent before they can stabilize."
