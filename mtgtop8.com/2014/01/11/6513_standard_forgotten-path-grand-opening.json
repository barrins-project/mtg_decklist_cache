It also utilizes strong planeswalkers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion to provide additional threats and card advantage. The deck's land base, comprised of dual lands and scry lands, helps ensure consistent mana while also offering some card selection."

Overall, the strategy revolves around efficient creature beats and strategic combat tricks to secure victory."
