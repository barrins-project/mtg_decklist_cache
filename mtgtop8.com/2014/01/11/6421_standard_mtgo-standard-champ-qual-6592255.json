The deck aims to control the board with powerful removal spells like Chained to the Rocks, while also using creatures like Boros Reckoner and Chandra's Phoenix to apply pressure and close out games. With a mix of efficient creatures and burn spells, the deck looks to overwhelm the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
