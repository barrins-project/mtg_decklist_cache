The key strategy involves utilizing cards with high black devotion to maximize the effectiveness of Gray Merchant of Asphodel's draining ability. The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's hand with Thoughseize and control the board with removal spells like Hero's Downfall. The inclusion of Mutavault adds versatility to the deck by providing an additional threat and a mana sink for later in the game."
