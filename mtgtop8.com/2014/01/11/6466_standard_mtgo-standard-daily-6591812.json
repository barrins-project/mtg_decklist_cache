            "notes": "This deck focuses on a fast-paced strategy that revolves around maximizing the devotion to black while aggressively controlling the opponent's hand and board. By using efficient removal spells like Devour Flesh and Pharika's Cure, combined with disruptive cards like Thoughtseize, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while deploying powerful threats such as Desecration Demon and Gray Merchant of Asphodel. The black devotion theme is further supported by cards like Erebos, God of the Dead and Underworld Connections, allowing for consistent card advantage and pressure on the opponent."
