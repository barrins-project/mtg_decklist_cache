By playing cheap flying creatures and increasing devotion to blue with cards like Thassa and Master of Waves, the deck aims to establish early board control and deal consistent damage to the opponent. The inclusion of counterspells like Judge's Familiar and removal spells like Cyclonic Rift helps protect the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent and secure a swift victory through relentless aggression."
