The deck aims to stabilize the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Detention Sphere, while generating card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation. Elspeth, Sun's Champion provides a win condition by creating tokens, and Jace, Architect of Thought helps to control the opponent's threats. The deck also has some flexible answers in Syncopate and Last Breath, along with a powerful finisher in Aetherling."
