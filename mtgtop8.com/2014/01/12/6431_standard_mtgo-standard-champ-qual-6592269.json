By utilizing cards like Frostburn Weird, Cloudfin Raptor, and Tidebinder Mage, the deck can apply pressure early on while protecting key threats. Thassa, God of the Sea provides card selection and evasion, while Master of Waves can generate a significant board presence. Cyclonic Rift and Bident of Thassa offer additional utility and card advantage. The inclusion of Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Mutavaults ensures consistent mana production and activation of abilities."
