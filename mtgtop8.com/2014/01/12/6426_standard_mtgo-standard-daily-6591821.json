The deck utilizes creatures with abilities that can control the opponent's board and generate card advantage, while also benefiting from the devotion mechanic to pump up Thassa, God of the Sea and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx. The inclusion of counterspells and bounce effects provides added disruption to the opponent's strategy, allowing for a more strategic approach to combat. Overall, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and maintain pressure on the opponent throughout the game."
