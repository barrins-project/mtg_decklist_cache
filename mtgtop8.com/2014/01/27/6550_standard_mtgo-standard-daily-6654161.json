By using cards like Pack Rat and Gray Merchant of Asphodel, the deck can quickly drain the opponent's life total. Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall provide disruption and removal, while Underworld Connections offers card advantage. Devour Flesh and Desecration Demon help control the board, with Abrupt Decay providing additional removal. The land base ensures consistent mana sources, with Mutavault adding versatility to the deck's creature lineup."
