Using this mana, the deck aims to control the game with powerful spells like Karn Liberated and Oblivion Stone while also maintaining card advantage with cards like Relic of Progenitus and Ancient Stirrings. This deck also includes some creatures like Wurmcoil Engine for stabilization and threats, as well as other removal spells like Beast Within to handle opposing threats."
