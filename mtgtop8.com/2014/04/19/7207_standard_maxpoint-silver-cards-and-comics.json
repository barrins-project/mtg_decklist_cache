The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Detention Sphere, while also generating card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation. The win condition of the deck is to either use Aetherling as a finisher or to gain card advantage and board presence with planeswalkers like Elspeth and Jace. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the control strategy and maximize consistency in casting spells."
