By playing efficient creatures like Tidebinder Mage, Nightveil Specter, and Master of Waves, along with a strong enchantment like Thassa, God of the Sea, this deck aims to establish early board dominance and maintain pressure on the opponent. The inclusion of counter spells like Judge's Familiar and tempo plays like Cyclonic Rift allows for control over the game tempo. Mutavault provides additional creature pressure while Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx enables explosive mana generation."
