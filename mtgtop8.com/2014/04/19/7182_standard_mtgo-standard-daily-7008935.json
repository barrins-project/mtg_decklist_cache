By using cards like Supreme Verdict and Detention Sphere to control the board, and Sphinx's Revelation to replenish resources, the deck aims to outvalue opponents in the long game. Utilizing cards like Jace, Architect of Thought and Elspeth, Sun's Champion for card advantage and token generation, the deck looks to stabilize the board and win through incremental advantage. Thoughtseize and Azorius Charm also provide additional disruption and flexibility to handle opposing threats."
