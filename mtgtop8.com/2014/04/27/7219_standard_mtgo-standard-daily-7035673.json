The deck aims to control the board with efficient creatures like Courser of Kruphix and Arbor Colossus, while also having the ability to go on the offensive with cards like Reverent Hunter and Kalonian Tusker. Nylea, God of the Hunt provides additional creature buffing, making this deck a well-rounded control and ramp deck in a Standard 1 vs 1 format."
