It utilizes cards like Stifle, Lightning Bolt, and Delver of Secrets to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building a board presence with creatures like True-Name Nemesis and Nimble Mongoose. The deck also includes a suite of efficient cantrips like Ponder and Brainstorm to maintain card advantage and dig for key pieces. The mana base is streamlined to support the deck's fast-paced strategy, with a focus on tempo plays and resource denial through cards like Wasteland."

Using cards like Dark Ritual, Cabal Ritual, and Lotus Petal to generate mana, as well as cards like Duress and Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's game plan, the deck aims to find and resolve a key spell like Ad Nauseam or Tendrils of Agony to win the game in one explosive turn. The deck relies on careful sequencing and efficient use of resources to execute its combo effectively."
