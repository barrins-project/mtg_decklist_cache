By utilizing a mix of creatures, burn spells, and disruptive spells, the deck aims to quickly close out games before the opponent can stabilize.

Arcbound Ravager and Etched Champion provide additional threats and protection, making it difficult for the opponent to deal with your board. With the use of cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, you can quickly deploy your threats and overwhelm the opponent."
