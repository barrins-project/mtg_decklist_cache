            "notes": "This deck focuses on quick and aggressive gameplay, using efficient removal spells like Thoughtseize, Slaughter Pact, and Maelstrom Pulse to disrupt the opponent while deploying threats such as Tarmogoyf, Dark Confidant, and Scavenging Ooze. Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and control, while Garruk, Primal Hunter offers card advantage. The mana base is optimized for consistency and the deck aims to close out games quickly with a combination of creatures, discard spells, and removal."
