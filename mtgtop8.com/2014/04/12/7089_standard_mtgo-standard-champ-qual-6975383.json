The deck also aims to take advantage of Thassa, God of the Sea's scry ability and generate a constant stream of creature tokens with Master of Waves. Key cards like Tidebinder Mage, Bident of Thassa, and Cyclonic Rift provide disruption and card advantage to maintain the pressure on the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence and steadily chip away at the opponent's life total."
