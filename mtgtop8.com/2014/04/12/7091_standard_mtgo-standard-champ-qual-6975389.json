By disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Thoughtseize and Devour Flesh, and wiping the board with cards like Supreme Verdict, the deck aims to survive until the late game where it can overwhelm the opponent with card advantage from Sphinx's Revelation and powerful threats like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Jace, Architect of Thought. Obzedat, Ghost Council provides a resilient threat that can help close out the game."
