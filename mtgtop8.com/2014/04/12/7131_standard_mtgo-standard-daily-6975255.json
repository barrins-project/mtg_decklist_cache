Additionally, disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Duress help control the opponent's resources, while card draw from Underworld Connections and removal spells like Bile Blight and Hero's Downfall ensure the deck can maintain its aggressive momentum. The inclusion of Mutavault and Pack Rat provide additional versatility and threat diversity."
