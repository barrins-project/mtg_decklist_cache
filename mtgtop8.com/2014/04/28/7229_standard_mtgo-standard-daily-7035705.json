By consistently playing threats like Desecration Demon, Pack Rat, and Nightveil Specter, the deck aims to control the board and drain the opponent's life total while generating card advantage through Underworld Connections. The deck's mana base is built around maximizing the use of Mutavault and Temple of Deceit to ensure a smooth curve of spells."

It utilizes a mix of counterspells like Dissolve and Syncopate, removal like Detention Sphere and Supreme Verdict, and card draw like Sphinx's Revelation to out-value your opponent and eventually take over the game with high-impact threats."
