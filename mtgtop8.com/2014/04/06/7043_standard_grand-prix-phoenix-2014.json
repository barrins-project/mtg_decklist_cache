By leveraging the power of Thassa, God of the Sea and her ability to make creatures unblockable, along with cards like Tidebinder Mage and Frostburn Weird to slow down opponents, this deck aims to quickly overwhelm and outpace the opponent. With a mix of creature aggression and disruptive spells, the Mono Blue Aggro deck seeks to maintain board control and pressure the opponent into submission."
