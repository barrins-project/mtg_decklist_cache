Elspeth, Sun's Champion provides a win condition, along with Aetherling. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the three colors of the deck, with scry lands and utility lands to ensure consistency and flexibility in playing spells."

The deck also includes disruption and removal spells to control the board and protect your creatures. Utilizing cards like Pack Rat and Desecration Demon, the deck aims to quickly drain the opponent's life total and maintain board presence through card advantage with Underworld Connections."
