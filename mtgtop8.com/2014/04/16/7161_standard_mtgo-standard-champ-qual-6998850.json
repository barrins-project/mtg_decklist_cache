            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game through counterspells, removal, and card advantage, while using powerful planeswalker and finisher cards to close out the game. The deck utilizes a combination of hand disruption, board wipes, and card draw to outvalue opponents and maintain control of the battlefield. It aims to slow the game down, answer threats efficiently, and then win through cards like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Aetherling. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's control elements and allow for consistent play of powerful multicolor spells."
