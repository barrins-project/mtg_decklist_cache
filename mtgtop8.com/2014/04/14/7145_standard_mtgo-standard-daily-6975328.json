By playing a mix of powerful creatures such as Desecration Demon and Gray Merchant of Asphodel, along with disruptive cards like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall, this deck aims to control the game and drain the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Pack Rat and Nightveil Specter provide additional threats and card advantage. The deck also includes removal spells like Bile Blight and Devour Flesh to deal with opposing threats."
