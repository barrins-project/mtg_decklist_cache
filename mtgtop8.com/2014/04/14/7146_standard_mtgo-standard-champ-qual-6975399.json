It also runs disruption and removal spells like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall to control the board and maintain tempo. Additionally, it includes card draw options with Underworld Connections and life gain with Whip of Erebos to ensure longevity in the game. The key strategy is to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent while disrupting their game plan."
