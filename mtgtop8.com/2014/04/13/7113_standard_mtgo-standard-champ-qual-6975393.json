By utilizing cards like Desecration Demon, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, and Pack Rat, the deck can quickly build a strong board presence. Additionally, using disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Duress, as well as removal like Hero's Downfall and Bile Blight, the deck can control the opponent's board while applying pressure. The deck also includes card draw and life gain with Underworld Connections to maintain a steady flow of resources."
