By utilizing cards like Cloudfin Raptor, Frostburn Weird, and Master of Waves, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence. Cards like Thassa, God of the Sea and Nightveil Specter offer card advantage and evasion, while Tidebinder Mage provides tempo advantage. The deck also includes some control elements like Syncopate and Jace, Architect of Thought to protect its creatures and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
