Cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Chandra's Phoenix provide additional value and reach, while cards like Firedrinker Satyr and Firefist Striker push for early damage. Foundry Street Denizen and Gore-House Chainwalker help to pump up the team, while Rakdos Cackler and Rubblebelt Maaka serve as cheap, efficient threats. Searing Blood and Shock provide additional removal and reach, while Titan's Strength buffs up creatures for surprise damage."
