By playing cards like Nightveil Specter, Pack Rat, and Gray Merchant of Asphodel, the deck aims to quickly drain the opponent's life total while also gaining incremental advantage through cards like Underworld Connections and Thoughtseize. With strong removal spells like Hero's Downfall, Bile Blight, and Devour Flesh, the deck can control the board and push through for a decisive victory. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver and Liliana of the Dark Realms provide additional sources of advantage to secure the win."
