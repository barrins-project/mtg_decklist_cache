This allows the player to play powerful spells such as Karn Liberated, Oblivion Stone, and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn to control the game and overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to help find the UrzaTron lands, as well as other cards like Pyroclasm and Relic of Progenitus to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy."
