By using cards like Oblivion Ring, Runed Halo, and Ghostly Prison, you can prevent your opponent from utilizing key cards or attacking you directly. Additionally, cards like Sigil of the Empty Throne and Endless Horizons provide you with a win condition by generating powerful token creatures. The deck aims to stall the game while building up your own board presence to secure victory in the late game."
