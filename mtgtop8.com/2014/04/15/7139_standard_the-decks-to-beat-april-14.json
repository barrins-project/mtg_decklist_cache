By playing low-cost creatures like Rakdos Cackler and Foundry Street Denizen in combination with powerful burn spells like Mizzium Mortars and Shock, the deck aims to deal fast and consistent damage to the opponent. Mutavault provides additional versatility and pump-up power, while cards like Chandra's Phoenix and Firefist Striker offer additional threats and board control. Overall, the deck focuses on putting pressure on the opponent early and maintaining that pressure throughout the game."
