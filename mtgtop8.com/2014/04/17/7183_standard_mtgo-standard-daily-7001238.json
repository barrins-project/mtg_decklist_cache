It utilizes cards like Desecration Demon, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, and Nightveil Specter to pressure the opponent while also gaining value through devotion to black. Pack Rat provides additional threats and resilience, while removal spells like Bile Blight, Hero's Downfall, and Devour Flesh help control the board. Thoughtseize disrupts the opponent's game plan, while Underworld Connections provides card advantage. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently."
