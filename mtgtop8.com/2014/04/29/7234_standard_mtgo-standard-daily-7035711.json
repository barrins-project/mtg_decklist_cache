The deck also includes disruptive cards like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall to control the opponent's board state. With cards like Pack Rat and Nightveil Specter to generate card advantage, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence and efficient removal spells. The inclusion of Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx provides additional mana ramp to support casting multiple black spells in a turn."
