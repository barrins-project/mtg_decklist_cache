By playing cards like Glimpse of Nature and Heritage Druid, the player can quickly develop their board and draw into key cards like Craterhoof Behemoth for a game-winning attack. Natural Order allows the player to search for powerful creatures like Regal Force or Craterhoof Behemoth, while Green Sun's Zenith can tutor for specific Elves as needed. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a massive board presence and powerful combo finishers."
