The deck aims to stabilize the board with powerful planeswalkers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Jace, Architect of Thought while also having access to lifegain and board wipes to survive against aggressive strategies. The inclusion of instant-speed card draw in Divination and Quicken provides flexibility in hand management and potential blowout plays."
