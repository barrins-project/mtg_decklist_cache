The deck utilizes ramp spells like Farseek and Search for Tomorrow to accelerate its mana and consistently hit its land drops to trigger Valakut's ability. Cryptic Command and Remand provide disruption and protection, while Snapcaster Mage adds versatility and recursion. Overall, the key strategy is to stall the game with control elements until the combo can be assembled to deal massive amounts of damage in one turn."
