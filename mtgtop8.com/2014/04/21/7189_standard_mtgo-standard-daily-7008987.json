The deck also utilizes cards that generate card advantage and disruption like Thoughtseize, Underworld Connections, and Hero's Downfall. By maintaining a devotion to black, the deck aims to maximize the effectiveness of Gray Merchant of Asphodel's ability, draining the opponent's life total significantly. The inclusion of Mutavault and various temples helps to ensure consistency and flexibility in both mana production and card draw."
