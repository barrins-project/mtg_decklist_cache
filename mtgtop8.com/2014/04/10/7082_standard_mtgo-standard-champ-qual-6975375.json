By including cards like Tidebinder Mage, Thassa, God of the Sea, and Nightveil Specter, the deck can apply early pressure and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Rapid Hybridization and Cyclonic Rift allows for additional removal options to maintain board advantage. With a streamlined focus on blue creatures and spells, this deck aims to establish dominance and secure victory through efficient aggression."
