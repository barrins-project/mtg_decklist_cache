The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with its aggressive creatures and graveyard synergy."

By utilizing a mix of efficient threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Polukranos, along with removal spells like Ultimate Price and Dreadbore, the deck aims to quickly apply pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan. The deck also includes mana ramp with cards like Elvish Mystic and Sylvan Caryatid to help cast its high-cost threats early. This aggressive strategy is further supported by planeswalkers like Domri Rade and Chandra, Pyromaster for added versatility and card advantage."

Banisher Priest and Imposing Sovereign provide disruption against the opponent's strategies, while Spirit of the Labyrinth can limit their card advantage. Mutavault adds flexibility and extra damage potential to the deck."
