By utilizing cards like Elvish Mystic and Voyaging Satyr to accelerate mana production, the player aims to cast big threats such as Polukranos, Arbor Colossus, and Garruk, Caller of Beasts early in the game. The goal is to establish board control and overwhelm the opponent with large creatures and powerful planeswalkers to secure victory."
