            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing mana ramping cards like Voyaging Satyr and Sylvan Caryatid to quickly build up mana and play powerful, high-cost creatures like Polukranos and Hornet Queen. It also includes cards like Courser of Kruphix and Eidolon of Blossoms for card advantage and consistency. The goal is to control the board with strong creatures and enchantments while ramping up mana to overpower the opponent and take control of the game. The deck can also use Chord of Calling to search for specific creatures when needed."
