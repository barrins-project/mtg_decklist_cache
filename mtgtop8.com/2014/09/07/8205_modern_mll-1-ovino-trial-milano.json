The deck aims to win the game through infect damage rather than traditional life total. It also includes protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing to ensure the creatures can safely deal damage. The lands in the deck support the infect strategy, with Inkmoth Nexus and Pendelhaven providing additional ways to sneak damage past blockers."

The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack also disrupt the opponent's game plan, making it difficult for them to gain life or cast spells without taking damage."
