Thoughtseize and Lifebane Zombie help to disrupt the opponent's game plan by stripping key cards from their hand. Pack Rat provides a threat that can quickly take over the game if left unchecked, while Desecration Demon and Blood Baron of Vizkopa serve as powerful finishers. The deck also includes some card draw with Read the Bones and Underworld Connections to maintain card advantage. Elspeth, Sun's Champion provides a versatile win condition and board clear option."
