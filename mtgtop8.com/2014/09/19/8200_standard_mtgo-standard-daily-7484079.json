The deck focuses on playing low-cost creatures like Rakdos Cackler, Legion Loyalist, and Young Pyromancer to create a board presence, while also using burn spells like Shock, Lightning Strike, and Stoke the Flames to clear the way and finish off the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Purphoros, God of the Forge and Chandra's Phoenix provide additional ways to deal damage and close out the game."
