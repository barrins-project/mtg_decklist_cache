            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the game by utilizing powerful black and white cards to disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain board presence. This is achieved through a combination of creature removal spells, hand disruption, and powerful threats such as Pack Rat, Desecration Demon, and Obzedat, Ghost Council. The deck also incorporates lifelink and card draw mechanics to help stabilize and gain an advantage in the game. The mana base is designed to support both black and white spells efficiently, with a mix of lands that provide colored mana and utility."
