The deck aims to dismantle the opponent's plans by using cards like Mizzium Mortars and Dreadbore to remove threats from the board. It also focuses on ramping up the mana with cards like Xenagos, the Reveler and Elvish Mystic to play big creatures like Polukranos, World Eater and Nissa, Worldwaker. The land base is designed to provide the necessary colors of mana to cast the spells and creatures efficiently."

Support cards like Kiora, the Crashing Wave, Cyclonic Rift, and Domri Rade help you maintain board control and disrupt your opponent's strategy. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with large creatures and powerful spells before they have a chance to respond."

The mid to late game threats come from powerful creatures like Polukranos, World Eater and Stormbreath Dragon, backed up by removal spells like Mizzium Mortars and Dreadbore. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of fast, efficient creatures and removal spells, maintaining pressure throughout the game."
