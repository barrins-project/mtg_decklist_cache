It includes burn spells like Shock, Magma Jet, and Lightning Strike to help remove threats and finish off the opponent. Young Pyromancer and Goblin Rabblemaster generate tokens to overwhelm the opponent, while Purphoros, God of the Forge provides additional burn damage. Mutavault provides extra creature threats and flexibility. The deck's strategy is to apply constant pressure and close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
