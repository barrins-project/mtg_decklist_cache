By utilizing efficient removal spells like Lightning Strike and Magma Spray, along with versatile cards like Jeskai Charm, players can clear the way for their creatures to attack. The inclusion of cards like Seeker of the Way and Mantis Rider provides a strong aggressive presence on the board, while cards like Chandra, Pyromaster and Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker offer additional sources of damage and card advantage. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of burn spells and powerful creatures, applying constant pressure and closing out games quickly."
