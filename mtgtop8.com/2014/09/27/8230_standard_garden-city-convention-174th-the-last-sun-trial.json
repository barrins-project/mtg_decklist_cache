            "notes": "The main strategy of this deck is to establish control over the game by utilizing a variety of powerful planeswalkers and creatures to dominate the battlefield. The deck focuses on generating mana efficiently with ramp cards like Sylvan Caryatid and Courser of Kruphix, allowing for the quick deployment of threats such as Nissa, Worldwaker and Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker. Additionally, the deck includes counterspells and removal spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own key cards. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of powerful creatures and versatile spells."
