By playing low-cost creatures like Ash Zealot and Rakdos Cackler, combined with burn spells such as Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames, this deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Cards like Goblin Rabblemaster and Legion Loyalist help to boost the power of the creatures and push through damage. The inclusion of Hall of Triumph also adds additional power to all creatures on the battlefield."
