By utilizing cards like Chandra's Phoenix, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Young Pyromancer to deal damage, while supporting them with efficient spells like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames, the deck aims to win the game as fast as possible. The inclusion of Mutavault provides additional versatility and potential for extra damage. The strategy of the deck is to maintain constant pressure and intimidation, forcing the opponent to react defensively or risk being overwhelmed."
