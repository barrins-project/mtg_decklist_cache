It aims to use cards like Thoughtseize, Duress, and Pack Rat to strip away the opponent's resources and disrupt their strategy. It also utilizes powerful threats like Stormbreath Dragon, Young Pyromancer, and Goblin Rabblemaster to pressure the opponent and close out the game quickly. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize consistency."
