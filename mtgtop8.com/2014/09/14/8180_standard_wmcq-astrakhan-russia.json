Supporting these creatures are cards like Selesnya Charm, Banishing Light, and Ajani, Caller of the Pride to provide removal and additional value. The deck also includes Temple Garden, Temple of Plenty, and Mana Confluence to ensure consistent mana production. Overall, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and continue to apply pressure throughout the game."
