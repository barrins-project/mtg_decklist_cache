By utilizing a mix of counterspells, disruptive spells, and efficient threats such as Delver of Secrets and Snapcaster Mage, the deck aims to control the game tempo and close out matches swiftly. The deck also features powerful mana denial with Wasteland and is able to generate card advantage through cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder. It is designed to be proactive and assert dominance in the early game."
