The strategy involves playing powerful creatures like Desecration Demon and Gray Merchant of Asphodel while disrupting the opponent's hand with cards like Thoughtseize and Lifebane Zombie. The deck also includes removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Abrupt Decay to deal with any threats the opponent may have. Finally, the deck utilizes Underworld Connections to generate card advantage and maintain a steady stream of threats."
