The deck also includes burn spells like Warleader's Helix and Turn / Burn for additional removal and closes out the game with threats like Aetherling and Keranos, God of Storms."

The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy while generating card advantage through cards like Sphinx's Revelation and Jace, Architect of Thought. It aims to control the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Detention Sphere, while also having versatile removal options like Doom Blade and Thoughtseize. The deck also has a finisher in Aetherling and Elspeth, Sun's Champion to close out the game once control has been established."
