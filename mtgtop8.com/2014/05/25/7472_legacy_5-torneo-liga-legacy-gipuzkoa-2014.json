It uses counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect its combo pieces, while also employing disruption in the form of cards like Blood Moon to slow down the opponent. The deck aims to win the game in a single turn by putting a powerful creature onto the battlefield out of nowhere, overwhelming the opponent before they have a chance to react."
