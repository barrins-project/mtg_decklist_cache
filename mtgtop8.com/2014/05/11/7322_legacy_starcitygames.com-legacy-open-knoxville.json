The goal is to cast spells that increase the storm count, such as Infernal Tutor and Tendrils of Agony, to eventually win the game in a single turn. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Cabal Therapy and Duress to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of card draw and manipulation like Brainstorm and Ponder helps to find the key pieces needed to execute the combo."

By playing efficient creatures like Lord of Atlantis and True-Name Nemesis, along with disruption spells like Force of Will and Chalice of the Void, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently. With a solid mana base and a mix of aggressive creatures and disruption tools, the deck is designed to establish board control early and maintain pressure throughout the game."
