The deck utilizes cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's hand, while also having powerful threats like Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant. The deck aims to apply pressure early in the game with efficient creatures, backed up by removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Maelstrom Pulse. The deck also has some resilience with cards like Kitchen Finks and Scavenging Ooze to gain life and disrupt graveyard strategies."
