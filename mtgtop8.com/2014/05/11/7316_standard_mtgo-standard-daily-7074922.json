It utilizes cards like Cloudfin Raptor, Frostburn Weird, and Nightveil Specter to establish board presence early on. Thassa, God of the Sea provides card selection and evasion, while Master of Waves can create a substantial army of elemental tokens. The deck also includes disruption tools like Tidebinder Mage and Judge's Familiar to control the opponent's board. Bident of Thassa and Cyclonic Rift offer additional utility and card advantage to maintain pressure on the opponent."
