By curving out with strong early plays like Experiment One and Fleecemane Lion, and using cards like Boros Charm and Ghor-Clan Rampager to push through damage, the deck aims to close out games quickly before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of Ajani, Caller of the Pride and Advent of the Wurm provide additional threats and support for the aggressive game plan."
