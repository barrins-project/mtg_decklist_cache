By constantly applying pressure and burning the opponent's life total, it aims to close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The deck is focused on dealing damage as quickly as possible, using cards like Goblin Guide, Hellspark Elemental, and various burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike to finish off the opponent. It's all about relentless aggression and finishing the game before the opponent can mount a defense."
