Underworld Connections helps maintain card advantage and keep the pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to be efficient in both offense and defense, using its devotion to black mana to its advantage."

These creatures are then buffed with auras like Ethereal Armor and Unflinching Courage to create large threats that can quickly end the game. The deck also includes combat tricks like Boros Charm and Madcap Skills to help push through damage and protect its creatures. The mana base is built to support the aggressive nature of the deck, allowing for fast and consistent starts."
