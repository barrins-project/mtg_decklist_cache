By combining aggressive creatures with disruptive spells, this deck aims to control the pace of the game and prevent the opponent from stabilizing, ultimately overwhelming them before they can mount a defense. It focuses on utilizing a tempo strategy to outmaneuver opponents and secure a quick victory."
