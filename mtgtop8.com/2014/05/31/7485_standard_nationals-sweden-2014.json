The deck also includes hand disruption with cards like Thoughtseize and removal spells like Doom Blade and Detention Sphere to deal with threats. The win condition primarily comes from cards like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Aetherling, while also utilizing the tempo advantage provided by Mutavault."
