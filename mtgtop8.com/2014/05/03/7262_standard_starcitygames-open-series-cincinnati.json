The deck also includes removal and control elements like Hero's Downfall and Abrupt Decay to maintain board control. The inclusion of Vraska the Unseen adds a versatile threat to the deck. Overall, the deck's strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and disruptive spells."

With card advantage from Jace and Sphinx's Revelation, you can outlast your opponent and grind out a win through attrition. Elspeth provides a win condition and additional board presence, while cards like Detention Sphere and Banishing Light help deal with threats on the board."
