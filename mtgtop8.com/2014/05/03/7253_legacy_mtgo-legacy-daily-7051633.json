            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly fill the graveyard with dredge creatures and then use cards like Faithless Looting and Careful Study to continually dredge and trigger powerful effects like Bridge from Below. By sacrificing creatures and generating tokens, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large board presence and win the game through a combination of creature attacks and graveyard recursion. The deck is designed to be fast and efficient, utilizing key cards like Lion's Eye Diamond and Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's game plan while advancing its own strategy."
