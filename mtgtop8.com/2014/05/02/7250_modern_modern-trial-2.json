By utilizing cards like Gitaxian Probe and Desperate Ritual, the deck aims to cast multiple spells in a turn to trigger storm and eventually finish with a lethal Grapeshot. Goblin Electromancer is key to reducing the cost of spells, while Pyromancer Ascension helps duplicate spells for increased damage. Misty Rainforest and Scalding Tarn provide mana fixing, allowing for a smooth and fast combo execution."
