The deck uses powerful control elements such as Force of Will, Brainstorm, and Abrupt Decay to keep the opponent's board in check, while generating card advantage with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Ancestral Vision. Tarmogoyf and Shardless Agent provide strong creatures to pressure the opponent, while Baleful Strix and Deathrite Shaman offer additional value. The deck also has a mana denial plan with Wasteland and disruptive threats like Liliana of the Veil."
