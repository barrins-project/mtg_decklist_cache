The deck aims to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy, using a combination of discard spells and removal, while also being able to protect its own threats with cards like Force of Will and Daze. Additionally, the deck has a strong mana denial strategy with Wasteland and versatile removal options like Abrupt Decay."
