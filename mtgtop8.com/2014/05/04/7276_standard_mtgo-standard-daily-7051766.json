Utilizing a mix of tempo plays and card advantage, the deck aims to establish early dominance and maintain pressure throughout the game. With a strong synergy between creatures and enchantments, the deck is able to adapt to various board states and disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining a consistent threat level. By leveraging cards like Thassa, God of the Sea and Master of Waves, the deck can quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
