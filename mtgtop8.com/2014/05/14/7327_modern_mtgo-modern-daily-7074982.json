By efficiently utilizing burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Searing Blaze, as well as powerful creatures like Goblin Guide, the goal is to pressure the opponent and win the game as quickly as possible. The inclusion of cards like Flames of the Blood Hand and Boros Charm help to ensure that the opponent's attempts at gaining life or protecting themselves are less effective, allowing the aggro strategy to continue unabated."
