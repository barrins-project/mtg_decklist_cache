The hexproof ability on creatures like Slippery Bogle, Kor Spiritdancer, and Gladecover Scout ensures that your opponent cannot target them with removal spells, allowing you to consistently apply pressure and control the game. Additionally, cards like Spirit Mantle and Rancor provide additional buffs and protection to your creatures, making them even more difficult to deal with."

The deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggro, life gain, and synergy between creatures and artifacts. It seeks to use Norin the Wary as a key piece for triggering Genesis Chamber and Soul Sisters for gaining life, all supported by powerful cards like Purphoros, God of the Forge and Champion of the Parish."
