The deck utilizes cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to ramp up its mana production and cast powerful cards like Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas and Etched Champion to dominate the battlefield. The synergy between artifacts and affinity creatures allows for explosive turns and overwhelming pressure on the opponent. Overall, the deck aims to win the game through aggressive plays and efficient resource management."
