The use of cards like Boros Charm and Chained to the Rocks provide removal and flexibility in combat, while Ajani, Caller of the Pride can provide additional support and finishers. Overall, the deck is designed to quickly apply pressure and win the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and burn spells while maintaining board control with Chained to the Rocks. Purphoros, God of the Forge and Hammer of Purphoros provide additional ways to deal damage and create tokens, adding to the deck's explosive potential. The key strategy is to be fast and ruthless, constantly pressuring the opponent and ending the game before they have a chance to recover."
