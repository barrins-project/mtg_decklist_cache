This allows for fast and aggressive attacks against the opponent, often overwhelming them before they can establish a strong defense. The deck also includes cards like Galvanic Blast for direct damage and Mox Opal for mana acceleration. The goal is to win the game as quickly as possible through a combination of artifact synergy and aggressive tactics."
