The deck includes powerful cards like Pack Rat, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, and Desecration Demon to quickly overwhelm the opponent. Thoughtseize, Hero's Downfall, and Duress provide disruption and removal to control the game. Mutavault and Underworld Connections offer additional card advantage and flexibility. The deck aims to establish board presence early and maintain pressure on the opponent to secure victory."
