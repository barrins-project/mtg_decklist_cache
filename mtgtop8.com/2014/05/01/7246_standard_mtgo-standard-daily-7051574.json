By playing powerful black creatures like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Desecration Demon, backed up by disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's resources and life total. Mutavault provides additional creature pressure, while Underworld Connections offers card advantage to keep the pressure up."
