The goal is to use Primeval Titan to search for lands like Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion and Slayers' Stronghold to give it haste and double strike, allowing for a quick and lethal attack. The deck also includes Hive Mind and Pact of Negation for protection and disruption, ensuring the combo can go off without interference."
