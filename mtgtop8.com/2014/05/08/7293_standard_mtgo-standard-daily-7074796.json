The black devotion payoff comes in the form of Gray Merchant of Asphodel, which can swing the game in the player's favor by draining the opponent for a significant amount of life."

By consistently casting black spells and utilizing powerful creatures like Desecration Demon and Gray Merchant of Asphodel, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Nightveil Specter and Pack Rat provide additional threats and disruption to control the tempo of the game. With efficient removal spells like Bile Blight, Hero's Downfall, and Thoughtseize, the deck can handle opposing threats and maintain board presence. Underworld Connections and Mutavault provide additional card advantage and flexibility in combat."
