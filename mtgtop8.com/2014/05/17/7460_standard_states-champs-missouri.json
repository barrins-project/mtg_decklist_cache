The deck includes a variety of combat tricks like Boros Charm and Selesnya Charm to protect creatures and deal extra damage. The inclusion of creatures like Witchstalker, Bassara Tower Archer, and Gladecover Scout provide resilience against removal spells. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with efficient creatures and pump spells, supported by a strong mana base for consistency."
