The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Polukranos, World Eater. Domri Rade helps maintain card advantage and Xenagos, the Reveler generates mana to keep the pressure on. The deck also has some flexibility with cards like Boon Satyr and Ghor-Clan Rampager for combat tricks. Overall, the strategy is to be fast and proactive, aiming to end the game before the opponent can stabilize."
