The deck aims to survive the early game with cards like Detention Sphere and Azorius Charm, then stabilize in the mid-game with Supreme Verdict and Sphinx's Revelation. The deck runs a variety of card draw spells to maintain card advantage and is able to win the game through incremental advantage and protecting key threats like Jace, Architect of Thought and Aetherling."
