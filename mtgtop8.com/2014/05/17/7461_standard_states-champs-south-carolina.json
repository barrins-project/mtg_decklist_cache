The deck aims to ramp up mana quickly with mana dorks like Elvish Mystic and Sylvan Caryatid to play powerful threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Polukranos, World Eater. Additionally, cards like Scavenging Ooze and Reaper of the Wilds help provide resilience and versatility in different matchups. Ultimately, the deck seeks to outvalue and outlast opponents through a combination of control and aggression."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressive Boros creatures and burn spells to quickly deal damage to the opponent. The key strategy is to put pressure on the opponent early with efficient creatures like Chandra's Phoenix and Eidolon of the Great Revel, while also using burn spells like Lightning Strike and Warleader's Helix to finish them off. The deck's mana base is built to support a fast, consistent curve, allowing for both creature and burn spell interaction to keep the opponent on their toes."
