The key strategy is to bring back powerful creatures like Nighthowler and Nemesis of Mortals from the graveyard using Whip of Erebos, while also utilizing Pharika, God of Affliction to generate deathtouch snakes. Additionally, Abrupt Decay helps to remove any threats on the board, allowing the aggressive creatures like Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord and Shadowborn Demon to push through for quick wins. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast, aggressive playstyle."
