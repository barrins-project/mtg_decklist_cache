By utilizing powerful creatures like Boros Reckoner and Fleecemane Lion, along with instant spells like Boros Charm and Selesnya Charm, the deck aims to apply quick pressure and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. With a solid mana base and a focus on early game aggression, this deck looks to establish board presence and maintain tempo throughout the match."
