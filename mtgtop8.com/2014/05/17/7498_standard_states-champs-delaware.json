It also aims to establish a strong board presence with resilient threats like Brimaz, King of Oreskos and Stormbreath Dragon. The deck utilizes a mix of red, white, and blue spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain control of the battlefield. It also includes a small number of utility lands to ensure consistent mana development for the deck's powerful spells."
