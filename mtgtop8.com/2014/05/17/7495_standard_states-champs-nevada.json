It aims to control the board with removal and hand disruption while building up a strong presence with large creatures like Desecration Demon and Gray Merchant of Asphodel. The inclusion of cards like Pack Rat and Underworld Connections helps generate card advantage and maintain pressure on opponents. Overall, the strategy revolves around maintaining a strong board presence and using the devotion mechanic to maximize the effectiveness of Black spells and abilities."
