It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while drawing into powerful win conditions like Sphinx's Revelation and planeswalkers like Jace, Architect of Thought and Elspeth, Sun's Champion. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistency, with a mix of temples and shocklands, allowing for efficient mana production. Overall, the deck aims to maintain control of the game until it can establish a dominant board state and win the game."

            "notes": "The main idea of this Naya Aggro deck is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and combat tricks to quickly deal damage and take control of the game. With a combination of aggressive creatures like Soldier of the Pantheon and Boros Reckoner, along with pump spells like Giant Growth and Boros Charm, the deck aims to apply pressure early and often. The inclusion of protection spells like Brave the Elements and Selesnya Charm helps to protect key threats and ensure they can continue attacking. The mana base is designed to support a consistent and fast start, allowing the deck to maintain its aggressive game plan."
