Utilizing powerful black creatures like Desecration Demon and Gray Merchant of Asphodel, along with disruptive spells like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent while maintaining a strong presence on the battlefield. By maximizing black mana symbols in the deck, cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel become even more potent, draining the opponent's life total quickly. The inclusion of mana acceleration cards like Mana Confluence and Mutavault help to ensure that the deck can maintain its tempo and keep the pressure on the opponent."
