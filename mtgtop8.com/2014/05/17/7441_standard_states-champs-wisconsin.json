It also includes removal spells like Dreadbore and Mizzium Mortars to deal with opposing threats. The goal is to apply early pressure and overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggressive creatures and burn spells. Cards like Domri Rade and Xenagos, the Reveler provide additional card advantage and mana acceleration to keep the pressure on the opponent. The strategy is to be proactive and constantly apply pressure to win the game quickly."
