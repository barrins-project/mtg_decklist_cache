The deck also includes removal spells like Dreadbore and Abrupt Decay to deal with opposing threats and planeswalkers, as well as planeswalker cards like Domri Rade and Chandra, Pyromaster to provide card advantage and additional damage. The mana base is optimized for consistency and allows for casting spells of all colors."

The deck aims to establish early board presence with cards like Cloudfin Raptor and Frostburn Weird, then finish off the opponent quickly with cards like Master of Waves and Nightveil Specter. Mutavault and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx provide additional mana acceleration and utility, allowing for explosive plays. The inclusion of disruptive elements like Tidebinder Mage and Judge's Familiar helps control the opponent's board and protect key threats."

The deck aims to stall the opponent's threats with removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Abrupt Decay, while generating card advantage with cards like Underworld Connections and Courser of Kruphix. Desecration Demon and Polukranos, World Eater provide threats that can quickly close out the game if left unchecked. The deck also includes resilient creatures like Scavenging Ooze and Sylvan Caryatid to help stabilize against aggressive strategies. Vraska the Unseen and Primeval Bounty offer additional win conditions and value generation."
