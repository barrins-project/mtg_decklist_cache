Additionally, cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish the opponent for casting spells, while Boros Reckoner and Frostburn Weird provide strong defensive options. The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Chandra, Pyromaster and Purphoros, God of the Forge to further pressure the opponent and close out the game quickly."
