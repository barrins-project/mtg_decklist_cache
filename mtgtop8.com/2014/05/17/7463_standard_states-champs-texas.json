            "notes": "This deck focuses on using efficient, low-cost creatures and burn spells to deal damage quickly to the opponent. The key strategy is to apply early pressure with aggressive creatures like Chandra's Phoenix and Eidolon of the Great Revel, while also utilizing burn spells like Lightning Strike and Warleader's Helix to finish off the opponent. The deck also includes a mix of removal spells like Chained to the Rocks and Searing Blood to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

The deck also includes disruption spells like Thoughtseize and removal spells like Hero's Downfall to control the board and protect your creatures. The combination of aggressive creatures and powerful removal makes this deck a formidable force in Standard 1 vs 1 matches."
