            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly flood the board with ramp creatures such as Elvish Mystic and Sylvan Caryatid, then follow up with powerful threats like Polukranos, World Eater and Stormbreath Dragon. Utilizing cards like Xenagos, the Reveler and Domri Rade to generate additional mana and card advantage, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures while controlling the board with removal spells like Dreadbore and Mizzium Mortars. The aggressive nature of the deck makes it difficult for opponents to stabilize, allowing it to quickly close out games."
