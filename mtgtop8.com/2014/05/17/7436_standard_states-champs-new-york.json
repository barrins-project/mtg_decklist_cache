Additionally, the deck includes cards like Boros Reckoner and Frostburn Weird for added versatility and protection. Domri Rade and Xenagos, the Reveler are included for additional card advantage and ramp. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, explosive attacks fueled by devotion to red."
