The deck uses the Devotion mechanic to maximize the power of Gray Merchant of Asphodel and maintain a strong presence of black mana symbols on the battlefield. Vraska the Unseen and Desecration Demon provide additional threats that can quickly close out games. This deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the match."
