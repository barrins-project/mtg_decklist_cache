The deck aims to maximize devotion to black mana symbols on the battlefield to get the most value out of Gray Merchant of Asphodel's draining effect. The inclusion of life gain and card draw through cards like Whip of Erebos and Underworld Connections help to keep the player ahead in resources while maintaining their aggressive game plan."
