By utilizing mana acceleration from cards like Sylvan Caryatid and Elvish Mystic, the deck aims to cast threats such as Polukranos, World Eater and Stormbreath Dragon early in the game. With additional removal spells like Dreadbore and Mizzium Mortars to clear the way, the deck can maintain pressure and close out the game efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Courser of Kruphix and Xenagos, the Reveler provide additional card advantage and mana ramp to further support the aggressive strategy."
