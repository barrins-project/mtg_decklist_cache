Thassa, God of the Sea is a central piece that helps to make creatures unblockable and scry for consistency. Master of Waves can quickly flood the board with elemental tokens, while Mutavault and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx provide additional mana sources and utility. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a fast and relentless assault while maintaining card advantage and tempo through various control elements."
