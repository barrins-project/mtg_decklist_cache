Using cards like Pack Rat and Desecration Demon to control the board and apply pressure, while disruption and removal in the form of Thoughtseize, Devour Flesh, and Hero's Downfall help maintain board control. Underworld Connections provides card advantage and Whip of Erebos offers additional life gain and graveyard recursion. This deck aims to punish opponents quickly and efficiently with its aggressive black devotion strategy."
