By utilizing cards like Leonin Arbiter, Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, and Aven Mindcensor, you can slow down your opponent's mana development and prevent them from searching their library effectively. This disruption gives you the time you need to establish a strong board presence with efficient creatures like Blade Splicer and Restoration Angel, ultimately overwhelming your opponent and securing victory."
