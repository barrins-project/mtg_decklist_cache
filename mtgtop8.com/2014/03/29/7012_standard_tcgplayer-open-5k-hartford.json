The deck also aims to gain card advantage with Underworld Connections and maintain board presence with powerful creatures like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Elspeth, Sun's Champion. The mana base is designed to provide the necessary colors for the deck's spells while also including utility lands like Mutavault and scry lands for consistency."
