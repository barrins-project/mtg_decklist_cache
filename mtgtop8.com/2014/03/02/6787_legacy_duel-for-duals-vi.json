By filling the graveyard with creatures like Narcomoeba and using cards like Balustrade Spy and Undercity Informer to mill the deck, the deck aims to rapidly assemble a winning combo and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to respond."

The win condition is typically through resolving Entreat the Angels or using Jace, the Mind Sculptor's ultimate ability. The deck's key strength lies in its flexibility and the ability to adapt to various strategies through its control elements and powerful card selection. It aims to outvalue the opponent while maintaining a strong defense and eventually overwhelming them with its threats."
