By utilizing a combination of auras like Ethereal Armor, Daybreak Coronet, and Rancor, the deck aims to make a single creature incredibly powerful and difficult for opponents to deal with. The inclusion of cards like Temple Garden, Misty Rainforest, and Horizon Canopy ensures consistent mana ramp and card draw, while also providing the colors needed for the auras. The strategy is to overwhelm opponents with a highly buffed, hexproof creature before they can find an answer."
