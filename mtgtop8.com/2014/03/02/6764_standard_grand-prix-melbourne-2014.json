            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the game by using a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to outlast opponents. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Detention Sphere, while also generating card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation and Jace, Architect of Thought. The win condition typically involves using Supreme Verdict to clear the board and then closing out the game with powerful planeswalkers like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Aetherling. The deck also has some flexibility with versatile cards like Azorius Charm and Quicken."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by removing threats with cards like Doom Blade and Detention Sphere, countering spells with Dissolve and Syncopate, and generating card advantage with Sphinx's Revelation. Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Jace, Architect of Thought provide additional win conditions, while Aetherling serves as a versatile threat. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure the deck has access to the necessary colors of mana for its spells."
