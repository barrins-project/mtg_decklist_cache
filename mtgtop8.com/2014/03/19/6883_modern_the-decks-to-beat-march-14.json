It also includes combo pieces like Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker and Zealous Conscripts, which can create infinite copies of creatures. The deck also includes disruptive creatures like Deceiver Exarch and Glen Elendra Archmage to slow down the opponent's strategy."

The deck is also focused on ramping up your mana quickly with cards like Search for Tomorrow and Sakura-Tribe Elder to ensure you can cast your powerful spells. Overall, the deck aims to stall the game until it can safely execute its combo and win the game in one explosive turn."
