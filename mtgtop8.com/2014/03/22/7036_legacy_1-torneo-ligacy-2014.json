The deck also includes disruption in the form of counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect the combo, as well as card draw and manipulation with cards like Brainstorm and Ponder to help find the combo pieces."

The deck also utilizes efficient card draw and manipulation spells like Brainstorm and Ponder to maintain a consistent flow of threats. It aims to control the tempo of the game by constantly threatening the opponent with a fast clock and disrupting their plays, ultimately leading to a swift victory."
