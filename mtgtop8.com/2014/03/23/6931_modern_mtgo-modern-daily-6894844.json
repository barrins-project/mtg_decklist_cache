The inclusion of Galvanic Blast provides some removal and reach, while cards like Arcbound Ravager and Etched Champion give the deck resilience against removal spells. Overall, the strategy revolves around deploying a fast and aggressive board presence while leveraging the synergy between artifacts to quickly close out games."

Zealous Persecution can be used as a finisher or to clear the opponent's board.

It then uses spells like Karn Liberated, Expedition Map, and Ancient Stirrings to control the game and disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also includes powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine, Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, and Spellskite for closing out the game. Additionally, it features cards like Oblivion Stone, Pyroclasm, and Relic of Progenitus to control the board and disrupt the opponent's graveyard strategies."
