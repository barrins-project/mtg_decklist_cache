It utilizes a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and board wipes to handle threats, while also using card draw and lifegain to maintain card advantage and stay in the game for the long run. The deck's win conditions primarily include a combination of finishes, such as the resilient Aetherling, powerful planeswalkers like Jace and Elspeth, and the massive card advantage and lifegain potential of Sphinx's Revelation. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to effectively control the game and outlast the opponent."
