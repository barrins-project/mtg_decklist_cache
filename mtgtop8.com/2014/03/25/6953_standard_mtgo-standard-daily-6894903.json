By controlling the board with cards like Detention Sphere and Tidebinder Mage, and applying pressure with evasive threats like Nightveil Specter and Master of Waves, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly. With a strong tempo plan backed up by card advantage and resilience, this aggressive Mono Blue Aggro deck can quickly close out games before opponents can stabilize."
