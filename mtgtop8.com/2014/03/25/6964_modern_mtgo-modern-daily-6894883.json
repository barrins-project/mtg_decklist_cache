The deck also includes control elements like Remand, Cryptic Command, and Lightning Bolt to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect itself. Snapcaster Mage provides additional utility by allowing the player to cast spells from their graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can assemble the Scapeshift combo for a lethal finish."
