By utilizing a combination of creatures with high power and abilities that can buff them even further, this deck aims to apply constant pressure on the opponent and control the board with a mix of versatile creatures and spell-like abilities. The inclusion of cards like Aspect of Hydra and Bow of Nylea allows for additional damage and utility, while cards like Gyre Sage and Nylea, God of the Hunt provide ramp and support for the aggressive playstyle."
