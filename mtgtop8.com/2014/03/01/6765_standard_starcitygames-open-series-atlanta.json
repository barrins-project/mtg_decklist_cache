These creatures are difficult to deal with once they are enchanted, and cards like Boros Charm and Unflinching Courage provide protection and additional ways to boost their power. The deck also includes removal spells like Chained to the Rocks to deal with opposing threats, while Ghor-Clan Rampager provides additional aggression and reach. The mana base is designed to support casting all the spells in a timely manner."
