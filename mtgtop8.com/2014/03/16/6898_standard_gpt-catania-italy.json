The deck aims to control the board and prevent the opponent from developing their own game plan, while slowly building up card advantage through card draw and efficient removal. The win condition comes from powerful late-game threats like Aetherling and Elspeth, Sun's Champion to close out the game once the opponent has been neutralized. The deck's mana base is optimized to consistently hit all its colored mana requirements for its spells."

The deck also includes versatile threats like Jace, Architect of Thought and Aetherling to close out games quickly once in control. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's triple-color requirements and enable smooth gameplay."
