By maximizing the use of devotion to blue through cards like Thassa and Ephara, the deck aims to control the board and outpace the opponent in tempo. Cards like Judge's Familiar and Frostburn Weird provide early game disruption, while Master of Waves creates a large board presence. The deck also utilizes powerful removal options like Detention Sphere and Tidebinder Mage to maintain control of the game."
