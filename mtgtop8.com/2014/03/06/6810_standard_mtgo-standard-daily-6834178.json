The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with discard spells like Thoughtseize and Lifebane Zombie, and deal with threats using removal spells like Bile Blight and Hero's Downfall. The deck also includes powerful finishers like Obzedat, Ghost Council and Elspeth, Sun's Champion to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted."
