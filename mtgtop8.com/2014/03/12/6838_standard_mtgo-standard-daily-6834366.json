By utilizing cards like Domri Rade and Xenagos, God of Revels to provide additional support to the creatures, along with ramping up with mana dorks like Elvish Mystic and Sylvan Caryatid, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and often. This Gruul Aggro deck focuses on fast plays, big creatures like Polukranos, World Eater and Courser of Kruphix, and efficient removal in the form of Flesh / Blood and Ghor-Clan Rampager."
