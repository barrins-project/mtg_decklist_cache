It utilizes cards like Imposing Sovereign to slow down the opponent, combined with powerful threats like Obzedat, Ghost Council, Desecration Demon, and Brimaz, King of Oreskos to maintain momentum. It also includes disruption in the form of Detention Sphere and Ultimate Price, as well as some lifelink and graveyard recursion with Whip of Erebos and Xathrid Necromancer. The mana base is carefully constructed to support all the colors needed for the deck."
