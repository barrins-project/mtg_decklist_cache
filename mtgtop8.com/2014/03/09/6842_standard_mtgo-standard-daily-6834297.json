By utilizing cards like Sphinx's Revelation and Jace, Architect of Thought, the deck aims to draw cards, gain life, and generate card advantage. Detention Sphere and Supreme Verdict provide answers to opposing threats, while Thoughtseize and Dissolve help disrupt the opponent's game plan. The mana base includes a mix of dual lands and temples to ensure consistent mana sources. Ultimately, the goal is to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent until the control player can win the game with powerful finishers like Aetherling."
