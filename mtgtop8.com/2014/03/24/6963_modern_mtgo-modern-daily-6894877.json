It then uses that mana to play powerful threats like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre. The deck also includes control elements like Karn Liberated and Oblivion Stone to deal with opposing threats. The deck is designed to quickly ramp up and overwhelm the opponent with big creatures while also controlling the board to prevent the opponent from mounting a successful defense."
