It uses control elements like counterspells (Condescend, Remand), removal (Oblivion Stone, Repeal), and card draw (Thirst for Knowledge) to control the game and protect its powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Sundering Titan. The deck also includes powerful utility cards like Academy Ruins and Mindslaver to disrupt and outvalue the opponent. Overall, the key strategy revolves around ramping into big threats while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
