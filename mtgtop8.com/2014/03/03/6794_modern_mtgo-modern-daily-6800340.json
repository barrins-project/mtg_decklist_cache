It also includes aggressive creatures like Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant to apply early pressure. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's hand with Inquisition of Kozilek and Liliana of the Veil while fueling its own graveyard with Faithless Looting. The Countryside Crusher can quickly become a threat as lands are continually discarded and put into the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to control the game through aggressive land destruction and creature pressure."
