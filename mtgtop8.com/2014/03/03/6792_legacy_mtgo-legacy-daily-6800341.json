It also includes cards like Price of Progress and Sulfuric Vortex to punish opponents for playing non-basic lands. The goal is to apply constant pressure and finish off the opponent as fast as possible, utilizing the aggro-burn strategy to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
