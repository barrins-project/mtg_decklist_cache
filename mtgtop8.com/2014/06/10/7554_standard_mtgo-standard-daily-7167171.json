The deck aims to stall the game until it can access its powerful finishers, such as Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Aetherling, while also utilizing card draw in Sphinx's Revelation to stay ahead in resources. With counterspells like Dissolve and removal like Supreme Verdict, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while building its own resources to outlast and outvalue them."
