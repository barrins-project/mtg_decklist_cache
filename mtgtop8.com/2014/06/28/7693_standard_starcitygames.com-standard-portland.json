Xenagos, the Reveler and Domri Rade provide additional creature support and card advantage, while Ghor-Clan Rampager and Boon Satyr offer versatility and aggression. Courser of Kruphix helps with card selection and life gain, making the deck resilient against control matchups. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient creatures and win through aggressive combat damage."
