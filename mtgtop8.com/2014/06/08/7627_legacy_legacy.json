This strategy aims to maintain card advantage through Dark Confidant's ability while denying the opponent's resources with disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek. The deck can quickly close out games by equipping creatures with powerful equipment and overwhelming the opponent with threats."

The deck also includes cards like Arcbound Ravager and Etched Champion to protect its threats and ensure a consistent aggressive game plan. With cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to ramp out its threats, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with early aggression."

The key strategy is to rapidly get these big creatures onto the battlefield to overwhelm the opponent and win the game. It also includes card draw and manipulation spells like Ponder, Brainstorm, and Gitaxian Probe to find combo pieces quickly, as well as counterspells like Spell Pierce and Force of Will to protect the combo. The mana base includes key lands like Ancient Tomb, Island','','');\"&gt;<a href=\"#\">Volcanic Island</a>, and City of Traitors to support the combo strategy."
