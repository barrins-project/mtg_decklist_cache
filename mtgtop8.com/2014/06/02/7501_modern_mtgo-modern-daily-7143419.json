By utilizing cards like Vines of Vastwood, Rancor, and Mutagenic Growth, you can pump up your infect creatures and make them more difficult to deal with. Additionally, cards like Apostle's Blessing and Dismember help protect your creatures and eliminate blockers. The land base is designed to support the aggressive playstyle of the deck, with Pendelhaven and Cathedral of War providing additional boosts. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and lethal infect damage."
