By utilizing cards such as Dread Return and Bridge from Below, the deck can bring back these creatures from the graveyard and create an overwhelming board presence. This allows the player to quickly overwhelm their opponent and win the game through a powerful graveyard-based combo strategy. The deck is designed to be fast, aggressive, and difficult to interact with, making it a potent threat in the Legacy format."
