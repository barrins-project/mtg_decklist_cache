By utilizing a high number of swamps and cards that require black mana symbols in their cost, the player can take advantage of the devotion mechanic to increase their creature's power and trigger effects like Gray Merchant of Asphodel's drain ability. With strong creatures like Desecration Demon and Pack Rat, coupled with efficient removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Thoughtseize, this deck aims to apply pressure and control the game from the early turns."

The deck also includes some protection with Celestial Flare and Azorius Charm to deal with opposing threats. Lastly, the deck runs a mana base that supports its color requirements, with a mix of lands that enter play untapped and provide additional utility."
