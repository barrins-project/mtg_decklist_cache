With cards like Delver of Secrets and Tarmogoyf leading the aggression, backed up by counterspells like Daze and Spell Pierce, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm opponents while disrupting their game plan. The combination of tempo plays, card advantage from Brainstorm and Ponder, and removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Stifle help maintain the pressure and ensure victory. The deck's mana base is also finely tuned to support its game plan effectively."
