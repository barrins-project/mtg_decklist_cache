With a focus on burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Fireblast, along with creatures like Goblin Guide and Eidolon of the Great Revel, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Price of Progress and Skullcrack also work to prevent the opponent from gaining life or benefiting from non-basic lands."
