It also utilizes win conditions such as Sigil of the Empty Throne to create a board presence while keeping the opponent on the defensive with cards like Ghostly Prison and Sphere of Safety. The goal is to control the game through denial and attrition, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with a combination of disruption and threats."
