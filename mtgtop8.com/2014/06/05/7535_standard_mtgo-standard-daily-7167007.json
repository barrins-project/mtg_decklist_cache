By utilizing cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx, the deck can consistently cast powerful threats such as Stormbreath Dragon and Purphoros, God of the Forge. The inclusion of removal spells like Mizzium Mortars and Chained to the Rocks helps maintain board control while cards like Hammer of Purphoros provide additional value. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient red creatures and burn spells."
