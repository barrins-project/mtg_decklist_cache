By using cards like Ajani's Pridemate, Soul's Attendant, and Soul Warden to gain life, the deck can pump up its creatures to become powerful threats. Cards like Norin the Wary and Genesis Chamber help to generate additional creatures on the board. Additionally, Purphoros, God of the Forge can deal damage to the opponent whenever a creature enters the battlefield. The overall strategy revolves around aggressive creature-based gameplay while steadily gaining life to empower the creatures."
