The deck focuses on efficiently utilizing cheap artifacts to both fuel its aggressive game plan and protect against removal with cards like Welding Jar and Etched Champion. The deck aims to establish a dominant board presence and close out games quickly."

The deck also has a finisher in the form of Keranos, God of Storms or Batterskull.

The deck aims to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan while deploying threats like Wurmcoil Engine, Platinum Angel, and Mindslaver to secure victory. By utilizing efficient card draw and search cards, the deck can consistently find its key pieces and maintain control of the game until the win condition is achieved."
