Once the Ascension is active, cards like Grapeshot and Past in Flames can be used to create lethal storm turns, overwhelming the opponent with a flurry of spells. The deck also includes card draw and filtering to ensure consistency in combo pieces. Overall, the key strategy of the deck is to chain together spells to create a powerful storm count and win the game in a single explosive turn."
