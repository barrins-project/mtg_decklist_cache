By using powerful disruption spells like Hymn to Tourach and Force of Will, along with efficient creatures like Tarmogoyf and True-Name Nemesis, the deck aims to control the game and apply pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes card advantage engines like Ancestral Vision and Shardless Agent to ensure a steady stream of resources. Additionally, the deck utilizes a mana base with a mix of dual lands and fetch lands to support its three-color casting requirements."
