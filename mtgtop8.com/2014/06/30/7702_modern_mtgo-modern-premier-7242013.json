This allows the player to control the game by countering spells, bouncing threats, and playing powerful spells, such as Mindslaver, Oblivion Stone, and Wurmcoil Engine. The deck also has ways to tutor for specific cards, like Expedition Map and Treasure Mage, to ensure consistency in its game plan. With strong control elements and powerful threats, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast its opponent in a longer game."

It aims to control the game with cards like Relic of Progenitus, Oblivion Stone, and Pyroclasm while searching for key pieces with Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying. The deck includes powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine, Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre, Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, and Karn Liberated to close out the game once the Tron lands are assembled. The key strategy is to ramp quickly and dominate the late game with powerful threats."
