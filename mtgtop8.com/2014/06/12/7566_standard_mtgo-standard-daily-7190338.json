Removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Bile Blight help to clear the way for attacks. The deck aims to take advantage of Mono Black's strong creature abilities and evasion to quickly take control of the board and overwhelm the opponent. Mutavault provides additional creature threats and the ability to apply pressure even when the hand is empty. Ultimately, the deck aims to win by efficiently dealing damage and closing out the game quickly."

The goal is to establish board presence early on with aggressive creatures like Lotleth Troll and Courser of Kruphix, while also having inevitability through the recursion provided by Whip of Erebos and Nyx Weaver. The main strategy is to out-value the opponent by maximizing creature synergy and graveyard utilization."
