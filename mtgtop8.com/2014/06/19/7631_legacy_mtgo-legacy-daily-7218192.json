The deck also has synergy with Bridge from Below and Cabal Therapy to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and explosive combination of graveyard recursion and powerful creatures, ultimately leading to a quick victory."

            "notes": "This deck utilizes the powerful combo of Show and Tell to cheat in game-winning creatures like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Griselbrand ahead of schedule. By deploying cards like Lotus Petal and Ancient Tomb, it aims to quickly assemble the necessary cards to execute its game plan and overwhelm the opponent with massive threats. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect its combo and ensure a successful Show and Tell. Ultimately, the goal is to quickly establish a dominant board presence and close out the game before the opponent can mount a defense."
