The main game plan is to quickly build up devotion to black through cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Erebos, God of the Dead, allowing for powerful effects and a strong finisher with Gray Merchant's draining effect. The deck also includes powerful threats like Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver and Pack Rat to pressure the opponent and maintain board presence."
