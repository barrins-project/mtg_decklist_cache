The key strategy is to utilize Natural Order to search for and play Craterhoof Behemoth, which can overwhelm the opponent with a massive attack. The deck also has access to various utility cards like Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger to provide flexibility and protection. Ultimately, the goal is to quickly build a strong army of Elves and finish the game with a devastating Craterhoof Behemoth attack."
