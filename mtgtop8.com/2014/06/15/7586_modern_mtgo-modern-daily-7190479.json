The mana base includes artifact lands like Darksteel Citadel and utility lands like Blinkmoth Nexus to support the aggressive game plan."

The deck looks to apply early pressure with efficient creatures such as Dark Confidant and Scavenging Ooze, while also gaining incremental card advantage with cards like Liliana of the Veil and Courser of Kruphix. Additionally, the deck aims to control the board with land destruction and maintain a consistent mana base through ramp and fixing lands."

The deck focuses on counterspells, hand disruption, and removal to keep the opponent on the back foot while slowly chipping away at their life total. Mutavault and Creeping Tar Pit provide additional threats and help close out the game. The inclusion of Sword of Feast and Famine provides additional versatility and protection for your creatures. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and grind out a victory."
