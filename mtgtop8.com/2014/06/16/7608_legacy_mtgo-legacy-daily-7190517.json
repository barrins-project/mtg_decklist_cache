It leverages the powerful card advantage of Ancestral Vision, Brainstorm, and Shardless Agent, along with versatile removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Toxic Deluge. Tarmogoyf and Tombstalker provide powerful threats that can end the game quickly, while Deathrite Shaman helps to disrupt the opponent's graveyard. Liliana of the Veil and Jace, the Mind Sculptor offer additional disruption and card advantage, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize and turn the game in their favor."
