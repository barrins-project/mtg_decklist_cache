The key strategy is to swarm the board with evasive creatures like Vault Skirge and Signal Pest, while using cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to maximize mana efficiency. The inclusion of Galvanic Blast provides some direct damage and removal, while Thoughtcast helps with card draw to maintain card advantage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and early pressure."
