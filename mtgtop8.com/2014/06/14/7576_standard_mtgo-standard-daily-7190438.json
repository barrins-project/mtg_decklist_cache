            "notes": "The main concept of this Jund Aggro deck is to quickly establish board presence with efficient creatures like Stormbreath Dragon, Polukranos, and Courser of Kruphix, supported by mana ramp from cards like Elvish Mystic and Sylvan Caryatid. Xenagos, the Reveler helps to ramp up mana and create tokens for aggression, while removal spells like Mizzium Mortars, Dreadbore, and Abrupt Decay help to clear the way for attacks. The deck aims to be proactive and apply pressure early on, overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats and efficient creatures."
