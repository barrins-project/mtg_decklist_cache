It aims to apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game with powerful threats like Elspeth, Sun's Champion and Blood Baron of Vizkopa. The combination of creatures like Brimaz, King of Oreskos and Courser of Kruphix, along with removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Abrupt Decay, allows the deck to control the board and outvalue the opponent. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's three-color identity, ensuring consistent land drops and access to all necessary colors of mana."
