By using Jace, the Mind Sculptor to bounce creatures and draw cards, backed up by powerful removal spells like Terminus and Swords to Plowshares, you can control the board and eventually win the game with powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels. This deck focuses on card advantage, disruption, and efficient removal to outlast and outplay your opponent."
