The inclusion of Whip of Erebos and Pharika, God of Affliction provides additional graveyard interaction and resilience. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure and control the board for a decisive victory."

It also includes card draw and selection with Jace's Ingenuity and Dig Through Time to ensure consistency and maintain card advantage. The win condition revolves around Pearl Lake Ancient as a finisher, backed up by Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver for additional control and threats. The mana base is built around a mix of lands that provide a balanced color distribution for optimal spell casting."
