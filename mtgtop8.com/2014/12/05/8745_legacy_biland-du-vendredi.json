The deck utilizes disruption spells like Duress, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Pithing Needle to control the opponent's resources and protect the combo. It also includes additional utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Maze of Ith for added flexibility and protection. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful and fast win condition."
