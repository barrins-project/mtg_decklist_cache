            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly set up and play powerful, game-ending creatures like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn by cheating them into play with the card Show and Tell. The deck includes a lot of cantrips and card draw to find the necessary combo pieces and protect it with counter spells like Force of Will. Additionally, Cunning Wish provides access to additional cards from the sideboard to help deal with specific threats or situations. This deck aims to win the game as quickly as possible by leveraging its combo potential."
