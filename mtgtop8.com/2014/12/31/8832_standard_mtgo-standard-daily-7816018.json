The deck includes protection spells like Ajani's Presence and Feat of Resistance to keep the creatures safe, while also including evasion spells like Aqueous Form and Ordeal of Thassa to ensure consistent damage output. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with powerful, heroic creatures while maintaining a strategic advantage."
