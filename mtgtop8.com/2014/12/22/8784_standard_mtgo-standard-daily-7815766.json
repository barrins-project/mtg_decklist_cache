In addition, the inclusion of cards like Murderous Cut and Doomwake Giant allows for interaction and removal against opponent's threats. This deck is all about putting pressure on the opponent early and maintaining that advantage throughout the game."

By utilizing cards like Jeskai Ascendancy to pump up creatures and generate value, along with token generators like Raise the Alarm and Hordeling Outburst, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early in the game. Cards like Stoke the Flames and Lightning Strike provide reach and removal to help close out games. The deck's mana base is designed to support the Jeskai colors and ensure consistent casting of spells."
