The deck's finishers, Siege Rhino and Elspeth, Sun's Champion, allow for a strong endgame presence and can quickly close out the game. The deck also includes a small amount of card draw and mana fixing to ensure consistency and maximize its aggressive potential."

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of threats and direct damage, while also having a bit of card advantage and flexibility through cards like Jeskai Charm and Chandra, Pyromaster."

The goal is to establish early board presence with cards like Monastery Swiftspear and Seeker of the Way, while also dealing direct damage with Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames. Chandra, Pyromaster provides card advantage and extra burn, while Eidolon of Countless Battles and Wingmate Roc offer powerful finishers. Chained to the Rocks handles larger threats, and Raise the Alarm and Hordeling Outburst provide additional creature support. The deck aims to close out the game swiftly before the opponent can stabilize."

The deck also focuses on control elements with cards like Hero's Downfall and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The creatures in the deck provide value with abilities like generating tokens (Sidisi, Brood Tyrant), card advantage (Courser of Kruphix), and board presence (Hornet Queen). The inclusion of Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver adds another disruptive element by exiling cards from the opponent's deck."
