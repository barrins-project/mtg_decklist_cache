The deck also utilizes cards like Pyroclasm and Electrolyze to control the board, while Dig Through Time helps dig for key cards. Prismatic Omen ensures all lands are mountains for maximum Valakut damage potential."

The main strategy is to use the Titan's ability to search for specific lands such as Boros Garrison, Tolaria West, and Vesuva to set up various combo chains. Hive Mind is another key card that can create a lockout effect by forcing opponents to copy spells such as Summoner's Pact. With careful land sequencing and efficient play, this deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful combos and efficient land drops."
