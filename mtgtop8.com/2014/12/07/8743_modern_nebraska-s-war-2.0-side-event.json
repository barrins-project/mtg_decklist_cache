The deck focuses on using low-cost spells like Lightning Bolt and Vapor Snag in combination with creatures like Delver of Secrets, Young Pyromancer, and Monastery Swiftspear to deal damage and control the board. With card draw options like Gitaxian Probe and Treasure Cruise, the deck aims to maintain a steady stream of threats while disrupting the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Mana Leak and Spell Snare."
