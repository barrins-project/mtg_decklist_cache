The inclusion of Pearl Lake Ancient as a finisher and Nullify and Disdainful Stroke as additional counterspells helps solidify the deck's control strategy. The mana base is designed to support the color requirements of the spells while providing some lifegain and flexibility."

Aqueous Form and Ordeals help to further enhance the creatures' abilities and make them difficult to deal with. The deck aims to be aggressive, dealing damage quickly and efficiently while also maintaining a level of protection for its creatures through various spells and abilities. With a focus on Azorius Heroic creatures, it aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful offense."
