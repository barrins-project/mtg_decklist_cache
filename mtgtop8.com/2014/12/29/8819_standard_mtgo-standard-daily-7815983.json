Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Whip of Erebos and Pharika, God of Affliction to gain incremental advantage and disrupt your opponent's strategy. The deck also includes removal spells like Murderous Cut and Hero's Downfall to control the board and protect your creatures, while cards like Courser of Kruphix and Eidolon of Blossoms provide card advantage and help maintain tempo."

Key cards like Seeker of the Way and Hero of Iroas help to maintain tempo and ensure consistency in the deck's aggressive strategy."
