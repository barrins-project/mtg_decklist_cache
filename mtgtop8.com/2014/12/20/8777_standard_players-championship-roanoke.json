The mix of powerful cards like Siege Rhino and Anafenza, the Foremost, along with efficient threats like Fleecemane Lion and Rakshasa Deathdealer, allows the deck to apply pressure early and maintain board presence. The deck also has some versatility with cards like Abzan Charm and Murderous Cut to adapt to different situations. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the aggressive game plan with efficient access to all three colors."
