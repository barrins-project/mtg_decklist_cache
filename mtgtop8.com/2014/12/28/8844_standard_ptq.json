The deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and deal consistent damage while maintaining flexibility with cards like Boon Satyr and Hour of Need. With a mix of creatures with trample, haste, and flying, the deck can close out games swiftly, punishing opponents who can't keep up with its aggressive tempo."
