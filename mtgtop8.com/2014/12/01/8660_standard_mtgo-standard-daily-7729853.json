This allows you to control the board and overwhelm your opponent with big creatures. Nissa, Worldwaker and Genesis Hydra also provide additional ways to generate card advantage and put pressure on your opponent. Ultimately, the goal is to establish dominance through efficient ramping and strong creature plays."
