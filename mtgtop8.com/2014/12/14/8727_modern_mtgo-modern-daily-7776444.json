            "notes": "The main concept of the Naya Zoo deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive combination of creatures and spells. By utilizing efficient one-drop creatures like Wild Nacatl and Monastery Swiftspear, along with powerful pump spells like Rancor and Groundswell, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence and deal significant damage early in the game. Support from versatile cards like Lightning Bolt and Tarmogoyf adds flexibility and resilience to the aggressive strategy, while cards like Voice of Resurgence provide additional value and protection."
