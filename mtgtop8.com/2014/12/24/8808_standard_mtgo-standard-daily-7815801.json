The key strategy is to control the game early with efficient creatures like Courser of Kruphix and Polukranos, then overwhelm the opponent with big creatures like Nissa, Worldwaker and Sagu Mauler. By generating large amounts of mana with Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and mana dorks like Elvish Mystic and Sylvan Caryatid, this deck aims to establish board dominance and outvalue the opponent in the late game."
