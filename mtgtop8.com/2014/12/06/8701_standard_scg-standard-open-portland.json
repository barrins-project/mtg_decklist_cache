            "notes": "This deck focuses on playing aggressive creatures and controlling the board with removal spells. The key strategy involves ramping up mana with cards like Sylvan Caryatid and Courser of Kruphix, while also filling up the graveyard to bring back powerful creatures like Sidisi, Brood Tyrant and Hornet Queen. The deck also utilizes card draw and recursion with Eidolon of Blossoms and Whip of Erebos to maintain a constant stream of threats. By overwhelming the opponent with efficient creatures and disruption, this deck aims to quickly defeat the opponent in a 1 vs 1 match."
