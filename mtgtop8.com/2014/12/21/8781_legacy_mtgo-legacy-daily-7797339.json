By utilizing cards like Bridge from Below and Dread Return, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent with an army of creatures. Cabal Therapy and Gitaxian Probe provide disruption and information gathering. The goal is to fill the graveyard as fast as possible and then use Dread Return to bring back powerful creatures like Balustrade Spy to win the game in a single explosive turn."
