Additionally, the deck utilizes card advantage and selection with cards like Jace's Ingenuity and Dig Through Time to out-value opponents. The win condition of the deck is to eventually close out the game with a powerful threat like Pearl Lake Ancient or through milling with Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver."

Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while exerting pressure on the board."
