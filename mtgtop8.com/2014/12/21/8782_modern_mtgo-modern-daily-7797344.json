By chaining rituals like Desperate Ritual and Manamorphose, the deck generates enough mana to cast a lethal Grapeshot or multiple Grapeshots from the graveyard with Past in Flames. The goal is to storm off and win the game in a single explosive turn."

By focusing on protecting this creature and pumping it up with auras like Rancor, Ethereal Armor, and Daybreak Coronet, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and hard-hitting threat that is difficult to deal with. The inclusion of creatures like Slippery Bogle and Gladecover Scout with hexproof ensures that the opponent will struggle to target and remove the main threat of the deck."
