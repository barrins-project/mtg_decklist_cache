By keeping the opponent's board clear and disrupting their mana base, the deck aims to grind out a win through efficient threats like Demigod of Revenge and Boros Reckoner. The snow-covered lands also enable the use of Skred as a removal spell. The deck's overall strategy is to outvalue the opponent and gain incremental advantage until it can close out the game with its powerful creatures."
