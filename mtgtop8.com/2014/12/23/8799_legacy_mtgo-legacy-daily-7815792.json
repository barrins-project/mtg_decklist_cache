The goal is to quickly apply pressure to the opponent and control the game with counter spells and burn spells. The deck also uses card draw spells like Ponder, Brainstorm, and Treasure Cruise to maintain card advantage and ensure a constant stream of threats. Additionally, it can punish opponents for playing non-basic lands with cards like Price of Progress."
