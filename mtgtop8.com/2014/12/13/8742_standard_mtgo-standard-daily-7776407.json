Cards like Sylvan Caryatid and Courser of Kruphix help ramp up mana while also providing card advantage. Doomwake Giant can act as a board wipe against token strategies, while Whip of Erebos provides recurring threats and lifegain. The deck also includes some graveyard interaction with cards like Murderous Cut and Commune with the Gods. Overall, the Golgari Aggro deck aims to overwhelm opponents with efficient creatures and removal spells."
