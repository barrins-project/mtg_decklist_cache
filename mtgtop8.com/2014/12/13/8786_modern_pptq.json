This strategy aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast and difficult to deal with threats, such as Arcbound Ravager and Inkmoth Nexus. The deck also includes defensive cards like Spellskite and Stubborn Denial to protect its key pieces. With a mix of creature and artifact synergy, along with efficient card draw from Thoughtcast, this deck looks to quickly close out games through a combination of creature damage and combat tricks."
