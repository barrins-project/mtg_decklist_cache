By playing cards that increase black devotion, such as Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Desecration Demon, the deck can quickly drain the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall help control the board while cards like Pack Rat and Mutavault provide a constant stream of threats. Underworld Connections and Whip of Erebos provide card advantage and lifegain, respectively, to help maintain pressure on the opponent. The key is to control the board and drain the opponent's life total quickly."
