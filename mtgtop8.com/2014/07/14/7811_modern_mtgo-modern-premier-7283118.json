By utilizing cards like Master of Etherium and Steel Overseer, the deck is able to pump up its creatures and overwhelm the opponent with high power threats. Cranial Plating is used to turn any creature into a major threat, while Arcbound Ravager allows for modular counters to be distributed and potentially create a massive threat. The deck also has access to Inkmoth Nexus for an alternate win condition through infect damage."
