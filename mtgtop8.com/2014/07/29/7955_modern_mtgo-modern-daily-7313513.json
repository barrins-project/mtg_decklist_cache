With the protection from hexproof, these creatures are difficult to remove, allowing for consistent aggression and pressure on the opponent. Cards like Path to Exile provide removal options if needed, while Noble Hierarch helps ramp up mana for quicker plays. Overall, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and overwhelm the opponent with efficient creature enchantments."
