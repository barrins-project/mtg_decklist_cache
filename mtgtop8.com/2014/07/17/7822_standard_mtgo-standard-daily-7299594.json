It utilizes cards like Warleader's Helix and Boros Charm to push through damage while also providing some removal with Chained to the Rocks. The deck also includes Eidolon of the Great Revel to punish opponents for playing spells, and Chandra's Phoenix provides a recurring threat. The mana base is streamlined to support the aggressive game plan with a mix of lands that enable consistent casting of spells."
