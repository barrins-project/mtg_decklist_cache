            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to aggressively build up a devotion to black by playing cards with black mana symbols in their costs. This is achieved through using aggressive creatures like Pack Rat and Lifebane Zombie, along with disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Devour Flesh. Once a high devotion to black is achieved, the deck can take advantage of powerful black cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Desecration Demon. The deck also includes ways to draw cards and gain incremental advantage with cards like Underworld Connections and Mutavault."
