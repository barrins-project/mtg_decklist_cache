The deck aims to control the game with efficient removal spells like Abrupt Decay and Wasteland, as well as card advantage engines like Brainstorm and Ponder. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional value and flexibility in different matchups. The deck utilizes a solid mana base with dual lands and fetch lands to ensure consistency and smooth gameplay."
