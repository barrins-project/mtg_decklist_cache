The deck aims to control the board with cheap interaction like Lightning Bolt and counter spells while applying pressure at the same time. The mana base is optimized for efficiency, allowing the deck to consistently play threats and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, this deck is focused on tempo and aggression to secure a quick victory in Legacy 1 vs 1 matchups."
