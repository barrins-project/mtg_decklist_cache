The deck aims to slow down the opponent's strategy and outvalue them in the late game with powerful planeswalkers like Jace, Architect of Thought and Elspeth, Sun's Champion. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the heavy blue and white spells with a splash of black for additional removal options."
