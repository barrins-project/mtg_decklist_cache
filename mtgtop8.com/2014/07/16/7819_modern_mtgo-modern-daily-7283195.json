The deck also includes removal spells like Dismember and Beast Within to handle any threats from the opponent. Overall, this Mono Green Aggro deck aims to win the game quickly through brute force and efficient creature plays."

The use of Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum helps to accelerate mana production and allow for explosive turns. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Etched Champion and Master of Etherium provide resilience and additional threats to close out the game quickly."

The deck also includes protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing to protect its creatures. Additionally, the deck includes Inkmoth Nexus as an alternate win condition and Cathedral of War to further boost the infect damage.
