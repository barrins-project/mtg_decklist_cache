By using cards like Bazaar of Baghdad and Serum Powder to dig through the deck, the player can then utilize cards like Dread Return and Bridge from Below to bring back powerful creatures and create an overwhelming board presence. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast combo win before they have a chance to respond, using cards like Cabal Therapy and Mindbreak Trap to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
