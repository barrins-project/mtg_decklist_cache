By playing aggressively and constantly applying pressure, the goal is to reduce the opponent's life total as quickly as possible, often bypassing their defenses with direct damage spells. The deck aims to quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize, utilizing a combination of direct damage and efficient creatures to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."
