The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with direct damage spells like Lava Spike, Rift Bolt, and Lightning Bolt, while also utilizing creatures like Goblin Guide and Hellspark Elemental to deal additional damage. Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack help to disrupt the opponent's strategy and prevent them from gaining life or stabilizing. The deck aims to win the game quickly before the opponent can establish a board presence or gain control."
