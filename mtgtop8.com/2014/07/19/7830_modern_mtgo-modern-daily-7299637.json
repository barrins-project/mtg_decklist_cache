By maintaining a low mana curve and utilizing cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel to punish opponents for casting spells, this deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can stabilize or gain control of the game. The inclusion of cards like Skullcrack and Flames of the Blood Hand also help to bypass any lifegain strategies the opponent may have."
