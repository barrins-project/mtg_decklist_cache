By ramping up mana with cards like Elvish Mystic and Voyaging Satyr, the deck can play high-cost creatures like Polukranos, World Eater and Hornet Queen earlier than usual. The deck also features control elements such as Reclamation Sage to deal with opponent threats. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm opponents with large creatures and use them to control the board while continuing to ramp up mana production."
