The deck looks to keep the opponent's threats in check with cards like Detention Sphere, Supreme Verdict, and Azorius Charm, while at the same time drawing cards and gaining life with spells like Font of Fortunes and Sphinx's Revelation. The deck also includes some counter spells and removal to disrupt the opponent's plans and protect key cards."
