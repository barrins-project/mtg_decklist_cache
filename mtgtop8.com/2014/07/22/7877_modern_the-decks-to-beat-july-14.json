The deck aims to maintain board control with counterspells like Cursecatcher and disruption cards like Spreading Seas, while also generating card advantage with Silvergill Adept and Phantasmal Image. Aether Vial enables cheating creatures onto the battlefield at instant speed, while cards like Kira, Great Glass-Spinner and Thassa, God of the Sea provide additional protection and evasion."
