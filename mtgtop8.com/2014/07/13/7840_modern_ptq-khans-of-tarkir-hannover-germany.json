The key win condition is to play Scapeshift with enough lands to search for multiple Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and mountains, dealing massive amounts of damage to the opponent. Cards like Cryptic Command and Snapcaster Mage provide versatility and card advantage, while Prismatic Omen can turn on Valakut earlier. The deck aims to stall the game until it can combo off and win with a single spell."
