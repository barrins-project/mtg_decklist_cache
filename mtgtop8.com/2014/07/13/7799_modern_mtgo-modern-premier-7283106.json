By utilizing cards like Spellstutter Sprite and Mistbind Clique to counter spells and disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also using cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize to dismantle their hand. In addition, the inclusion of powerful control spells like Cryptic Command and removal spells like Dismember and Doom Blade helps to maintain control of the board. Overall, this deck focuses on disruption and control to outmaneuver the opponent and secure victory."

The inclusion of Snapcaster Mage provides additional flexibility and value by allowing the player to reuse key spells from their graveyard."

It utilizes card draw and tutors to find key pieces of the combo, while also disrupting the opponent with Pact of Negation. The goal is to swarm the board with powerful creatures and overwhelm the opponent in a single explosive turn. With the ability to generate a massive amount of mana and play multiple spells in a turn, the deck aims to consistently pull off its combo and win the game swiftly."
