By using creatures with haste and strong abilities like Ash Zealot and Firefist Striker, along with burn spells like Searing Blood and Shock, the deck aims to deal damage early and often to win the game before the opponent can stabilize. With a focus on fast-paced aggression and efficient damage output, this deck is designed to put pressure on the opponent from the start and maintain that pressure throughout the game."

With a heavy emphasis on disruption and removal through cards like Thoughtseize, Bile Blight, and Hero's Downfall, this deck aims to control the board while applying constant pressure with creatures like Pack Rat. The inclusion of Mutavault and Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth helps to ensure consistent mana production for powerful plays."
