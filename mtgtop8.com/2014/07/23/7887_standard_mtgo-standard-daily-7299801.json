The creatures in the deck are resilient threats that can quickly take over the game if left unchecked. The deck utilizes a mix of creatures, removal, and card draw to outvalue the opponent and grind out a win. The Orzhov color combination allows for a strong control strategy with powerful threats like Pack Rat, Obzedat, Ghost Council, and Blood Baron of Vizkopa to seal the deal."
