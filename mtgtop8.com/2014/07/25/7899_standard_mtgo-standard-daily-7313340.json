By utilizing cards such as Thassa, God of the Sea and Master of Waves, the deck aims to generate a strong board presence and create pressure on the opponent. Cards like Tidebinder Mage and Judge's Familiar are included to disrupt the opponent's strategy, while Frostburn Weird and Nightveil Specter provide additional threats. The inclusion of Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx allows for explosive mana generation, enabling big plays earlier in the game."
