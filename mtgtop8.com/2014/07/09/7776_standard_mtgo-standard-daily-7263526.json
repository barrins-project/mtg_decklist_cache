By quickly establishing a board presence and utilizing cards like Thassa, God of the Sea and Master of Waves, the deck can quickly snowball and control the game. The inclusion of counterspells and bounce effects like Cyclonic Rift also provides disruption to the opponent's game plan while maintaining pressure. Overall, the deck's key strategy is to flood the board with creatures, buff them with Hall of Triumph, and control the game tempo."
