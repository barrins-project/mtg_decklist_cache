By playing creatures like Cloudfin Raptor, Frostburn Weird, and Judge's Familiar, the deck aims to control the tempo of the game and build up devotion for Thassa, God of the Sea and Master of Waves. Cards like Tidebinder Mage and Rapid Hybridization help to disrupt the opponent's strategy, while cards like Bident of Thassa and Hall of Triumph provide additional sources of card advantage and pump up the team."
