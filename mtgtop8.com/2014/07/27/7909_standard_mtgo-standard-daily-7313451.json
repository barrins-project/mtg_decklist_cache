Additionally, cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish opponents for casting spells, making it difficult for them to effectively respond to the aggressive threats on the board."

            "notes": "The primary concept of this Orzhov Control deck is to maintain strong control over the game while slowly draining the opponent's resources and life. The key strategy is to use removal spells like Hero's Downfall, Devour Flesh, and Bile Blight to eliminate threats, while also using Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also utilizes creatures like Lifebane Zombie and Blood Baron of Vizkopa to deal with specific threats and gain additional advantage. The inclusion of cards like Underworld Connections and Whip of Erebos also helps generate card advantage and sustain the player's resources. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and secure victory through attrition."
