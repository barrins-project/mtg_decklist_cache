By playing defensively and disrupting opponents' strategies, this deck can outlast its opponents and take advantage of card advantage. The key concept is to maintain control of the battlefield and gradually gain the upper hand through card advantage and powerful late-game threats. By efficiently using removal, counterspells, and planeswalker abilities, this deck can dictate the pace of the game and secure victory through attrition."
