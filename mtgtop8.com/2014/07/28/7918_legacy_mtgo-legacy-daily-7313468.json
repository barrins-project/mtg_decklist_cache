            "notes": "The deck's main strategy is to quickly apply pressure on the opponent by playing efficient threats like True-Name Nemesis and Delver of Secrets while disrupting their game plan with cards like Wasteland and counterspells. Stoneforge Mystic is used to search for powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Batterskull to further enhance the deck's aggressive capabilities. The deck is able to control the game through a combination of card advantage from Gitaxian Probe and cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder, along with answers like Swords to Plowshares and Lightning Bolt to deal with threats."
