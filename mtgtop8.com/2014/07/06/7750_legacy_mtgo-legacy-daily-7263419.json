By utilizing Aether Vial to cheat in creatures and Cavern of Souls to protect them from counters, the deck aims to establish board presence early on. Cards like True-Name Nemesis and Umezawa's Jitte provide additional threats and removal options, while cards like Merrow Reejerey and Lord of Atlantis offer tribal synergies and buffs. The deck aims to win through aggressive creature damage while keeping control of the board with counterspells and disruptive creatures."
