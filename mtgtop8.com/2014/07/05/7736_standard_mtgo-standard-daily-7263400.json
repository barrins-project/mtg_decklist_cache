The key strategy is to build up devotion to black by playing cards like Gray Merchant of Asphodel and Lifebane Zombie, which can then pump up other key cards like Desecration Demon. By consistently disrupting opponents with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Duress, and utilizing removal spells like Hero's Downfall and Devour Flesh, this deck aims to consistently apply pressure and control the game."
