By utilizing cards like Cranial Plating and Arcbound Ravager, along with creatures like Etched Champion and Steel Overseer, the deck aims to deal fast and consistent damage to the opponent. The inclusion of Inkmoth Nexus also provides an alternative win condition through infect damage. Overall, the key strategy is to be aggressive and maintain pressure on the opponent to secure a quick victory."

The key strategy is to control the board and prevent the opponent from executing their game plan by countering their spells, removing their threats, and disrupting their hand. The deck also has a secondary win condition in the form of creatures that can quickly close out the game if left unchecked. By efficiently managing resources and controlling the flow of the game, this deck aims to outlast the opponent and secure victory through attrition."
