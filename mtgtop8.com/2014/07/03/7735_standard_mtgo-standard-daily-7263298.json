The deck focuses on tempo and disrupting the opponent's game plan, while also building up a strong board presence with creatures like Master of Waves and Thassa, God of the Sea. The inclusion of Mutavault and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx helps provide additional mana sources and creature buffs, while Bident of Thassa can help draw additional cards. Overall, the deck aims to quickly establish dominance and control the game."
