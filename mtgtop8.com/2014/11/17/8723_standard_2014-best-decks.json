            "notes": "The deck focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with aggressive creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Mantis Rider, while using burn spells like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames to deal direct damage. Jeskai Charm provides versatility, allowing for either burn, lifelink, or a creatures' return. Dig Through Time helps to filter through the deck for key cards, and Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker adds a powerful threat to the board. Anger of the Gods and Banishing Light offer removal options to control the opponent's board presence, maintaining pressure on the opponent."

The deck includes powerful finishers like Hornet Queen and Sagu Mauler to quickly close out games. The mana base allows for a smooth curve and consistent access to all the colors needed for the spells and creatures in the deck. The Whip of Erebos provides additional value by recurring creatures from the graveyard."
