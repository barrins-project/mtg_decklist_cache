The deck focuses on utilizing cards such as Infernal Tutor, Cabal Ritual, Dark Ritual, and Lion's Eye Diamond to generate mana, as well as Ponder, Brainstorm, and Gitaxian Probe to draw cards and sculpt the perfect hand. This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large storm count and finish the game with a Tendrils of Agony or Past in Flames."
