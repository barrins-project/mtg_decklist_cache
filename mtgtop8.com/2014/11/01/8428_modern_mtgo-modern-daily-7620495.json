By utilizing the cycle ability on cards like Street Wraith and Architects of Will, the deck aims to consistently set up the Living End combo for a powerful win condition."

The deck aims to control the board with cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack, while also drawing cards and maintaining card advantage with Treasure Cruise. The mana base is optimized to consistently cast spells and ensure a fast start to pressure the opponent and finish the game quickly."
