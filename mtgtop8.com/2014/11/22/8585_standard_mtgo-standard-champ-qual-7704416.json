It also includes burn spells like Lightning Strike and Crater's Claws to deal direct damage to the opponent or remove blockers. The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and maintain that pressure to win quickly before the opponent can stabilize. It uses a combination of efficient creatures and burn spells to maximize damage output and secure victory."
