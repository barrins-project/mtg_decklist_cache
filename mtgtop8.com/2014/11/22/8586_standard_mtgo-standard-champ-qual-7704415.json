            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressive plays using creatures with haste and evasion abilities, along with burn spells for removal and reach. The key strategy is to apply pressure on the opponent early in the game, using cards like Goblin Rabblemaster and Mantis Rider to deal damage quickly. Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker provides a powerful finisher, while Hushwing Gryff disrupts opponent's creature-based strategies. The deck also includes card draw and protection spells to ensure consistency and resilience in combat. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient threats."
