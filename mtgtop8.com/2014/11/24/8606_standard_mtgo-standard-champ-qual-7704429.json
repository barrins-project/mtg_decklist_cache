By efficiently managing threats and disrupting the opponent's strategy, the goal is to outlast and outvalue the opponent until you can establish a dominant position on the board. The deck also includes card draw and powerful planeswalkers to provide additional resources and ways to win the game. Overall, the strategy revolves around maintaining control of the game and outmaneuvering the opponent."
