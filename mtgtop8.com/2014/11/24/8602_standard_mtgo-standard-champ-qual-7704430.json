The deck aims to quickly build a board presence with cards like Goblin Rabblemaster and Fanatic of Xenagos, supported by ramp from Elvish Mystic and powerful creatures like Stormbreath Dragon. With a mix of early aggression and late-game threats, the deck looks to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
