It also includes a mix of powerful creatures like Butcher of the Horde and Stormbreath Dragon to apply pressure on the opponent while maintaining control. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Sorin, Solemn Visitor and Chandra, Pyromaster provides additional ways to generate value and advantage. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building a strong board presence to secure the win."
