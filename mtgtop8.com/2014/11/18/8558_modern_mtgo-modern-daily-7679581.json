The deck aims to control the game with Chalice of the Void and Relic of Progenitus while using cards like Tidebinder Mage and Merrow Reejerey to tap down or buff creatures. The deck's powerhouses are Master of Waves, Master of the Pearl Trident, and Lord of Atlantis to generate a powerful board presence."

By protecting the creature with Leyline of Sanctity and boosting its power and toughness with auras like Daybreak Coronet, Ethereal Armor, and Unflinching Courage, it can quickly overwhelm opponents with a large, evasive threat. With a combination of efficient creatures like Gladecover Scout and card draw from Kor Spiritdancer, the deck aims to quickly kill the opponent before they have a chance to respond."
