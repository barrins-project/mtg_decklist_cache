By using a combination of early threats like Fleecemane Lion and Heir of the Wilds, along with resilient finishers like Siege Rhino and Wingmate Roc, the deck aims to pressure opponents and close out games quickly. Thoughtseize helps disrupt opponents' game plans, while Abzan Charm and Hero's Downfall provide versatile removal options. The deck also has some lifegain and recursion with Whip of Erebos, allowing for extra staying power in longer games."
