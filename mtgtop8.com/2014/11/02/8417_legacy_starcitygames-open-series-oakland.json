By utilizing cards that can be played from the graveyard or have a strong synergy with having cards in the graveyard, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with swarms of creatures and close out the game with explosive plays. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Cabal Therapy to disrupt opponent's strategies."
