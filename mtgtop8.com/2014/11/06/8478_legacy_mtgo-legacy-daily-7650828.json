The key concept revolves around deploying a combination of artifacts such as Ensnaring Bridge, Thopter Foundry, and Sword of the Meek to create a defensive lock while generating card advantage and gaining life. Additionally, Tezzeret planeswalkers, Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and Transmute Artifact provide further card selection and manipulation, allowing the deck to adapt to various game states. The inclusion of disruptive cards like Engineered Explosives, Chalice of the Void, and Force of Will further reinforces the control aspect of the deck."

By efficiently dealing with threats and drawing into powerful spells like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Dig Through Time, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent in the long game. Additionally, the inclusion of Stoneforge Mystic and equipment like Batterskull provides a win condition that can be difficult to deal with for opposing decks. Overall, the deck excels at controlling the board and setting up powerful plays to secure victory."
