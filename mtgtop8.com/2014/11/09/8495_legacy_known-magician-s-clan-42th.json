            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to maintain control over the game through counterspells and powerful board wipes, while using card advantage and manipulation to gain incremental advantages over the opponent. The combination of cards like Counterbalance, Sensei's Divining Top, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor allows for precise control over what spells are resolved and when, while Terminus and Swords to Plowshares provide answers to threats on the board. Overall, the deck aims to out-value the opponent and maintain control of the game until it can safely close out the game with powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels."
