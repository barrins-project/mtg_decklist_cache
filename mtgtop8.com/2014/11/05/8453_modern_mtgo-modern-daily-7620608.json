The deck also aims to control the board with creatures like Flickerwisp and Restoration Angel, while applying pressure with aggressive creatures like Serra Avenger and Blade Splicer. The use of Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment and allows for surprise plays with cards like Cloudshift. The deck's goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of disruption and aggression."
