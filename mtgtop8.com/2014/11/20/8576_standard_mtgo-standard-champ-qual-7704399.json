By playing low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Foundry Street Denizen, along with pump spells like Titan's Strength and Hammerhand, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Cards like Goblin Rabblemaster and Firedrinker Satyr provide additional threats on the board, while spells like Stoke the Flames and Lightning Strike help to finish off opponents or remove blockers. The goal is to maintain pressure and force the opponent to react defensively, ultimately leading to victory through relentless aggression."
