The strategy revolves around playing efficiently, controlling the board with key creatures like Arcbound Ravager and Etched Champion, and overwhelming the opponent before they can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Cranial Plating and Steel Overseer enhances the deck's aggro potential, while Thoughtcast provides card advantage to maintain momentum. Overall, the deck aims to win the game quickly through aggressive plays and synergistic interactions."
