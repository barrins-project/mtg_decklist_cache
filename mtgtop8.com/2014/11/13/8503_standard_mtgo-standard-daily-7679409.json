By utilizing efficient creatures like Ashcloud Phoenix, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Savage Knuckleblade, along with burn spells like Crater's Claws and Lightning Strike, the goal is to apply pressure and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The mana base allows for consistent early plays and smooth mana fixing, enabling a fast and powerful tempo-driven strategy to secure victory."
