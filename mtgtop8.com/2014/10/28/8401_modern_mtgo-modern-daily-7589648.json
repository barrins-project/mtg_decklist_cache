By utilizing cards like Monastery Swiftspear, Snapcaster Mage, and Young Pyromancer to apply constant pressure, combined with disruption from counterspells like Mana Leak and Spell Pierce, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The deck also includes card draw in the form of Gitaxian Probe and Treasure Cruise to maintain card advantage. The mana base is optimized for casting spells quickly and efficiently."
