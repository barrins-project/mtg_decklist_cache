By playing cards like Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx and Nissa, Worldwaker, you can generate a large amount of mana early on in the game. This enables you to play big creatures like Polukranos, World Eater, Hornet Queen, and Arbor Colossus. Additionally, cards like Courser of Kruphix and Sylvan Caryatid help with mana acceleration and provide some defense. The deck aims to control the game by overwhelming opponents with its large creatures and mana advantage."

By playing efficient threats like Fleecemane Lion, Siege Rhino, and Courser of Kruphix, the deck aims to apply early pressure while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Hero's Downfall and Abzan Charm. The addition of powerful planeswalkers like Sorin, Solemn Visitor and Elspeth, Sun's Champion provides additional threats and card advantage. The mana base is designed to ensure consistent and smooth gameplay, allowing the deck to maintain momentum and close out games quickly."
