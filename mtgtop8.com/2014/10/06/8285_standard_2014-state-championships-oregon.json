This allows for easy casting of powerful cards like Whip of Erebos and Empty the Pits. The deck also features strong creatures like Siege Rhino and Hornet Queen to pressure the opponent. With a mix of graveyard interaction, ramp, and powerful threats, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a strong board presence and efficient removal spells."

By using cards like Siege Rhino, Wingmate Roc, and Elspeth, Sun's Champion, along with efficient removal like Hero's Downfall and Abzan Charm, the deck aims to quickly establish a strong board presence while disrupting the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of mana-fixing lands like Windswept Heath and Sandsteppe Citadel allows for consistent mana production to cast the powerful spells in the deck."
