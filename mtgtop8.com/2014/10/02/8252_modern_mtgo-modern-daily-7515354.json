The deck aims to control the game with cards like Liliana of the Veil and Ensnaring Bridge, while also generating card advantage with Raven's Crime and Wrench Mind. Mutavault provides some flexibility as a creature land, and Pack Rat can quickly generate a threatening board presence. Waste Not and Dakmor Salvage offer additional utility and synergy within the deck."

Cards like Lightning Bolt, Rift Bolt, and Lava Spike provide consistent damage, while creatures like Goblin Guide and Grim Lavamancer apply pressure and keep the opponent on the back foot. The inclusion of Eidolon of the Great Revel punishes opponents for casting spells, making it difficult for them to effectively respond to the aggressive onslaught."
