The deck aims to control the board and deal damage quickly to the opponent, with cards like Ashcloud Phoenix and Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker providing additional threats. Card advantage is also important, with cards like Dig Through Time and Steam Augury helping to filter through the deck for more threats and answers. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain momentum throughout the game."
