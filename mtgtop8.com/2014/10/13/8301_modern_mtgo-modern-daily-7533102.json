Primeval Titan searches for lands that can produce multiple mana, allowing for explosive plays and setting up for combos with cards like Hive Mind. The goal is to achieve a strong board presence early in the game and overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and utility lands. The deck focuses on efficiently searching and casting key pieces to create a dominant board state and win the game through overwhelming advantage."
