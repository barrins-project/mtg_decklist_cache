This is achieved using cards like Show and Tell, Enter the Infinite, Dream Halls, and Omniscience, while also having protection in the form of Pact of Negation and Force of Will. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its combo pieces and win the game in a single explosive turn."

Cards like Terminus, Force of Will, and Swords to Plowshares are used to deal with threats, while Brainstorm and Jace, the Mind Sculptor provide card selection and advantage. The deck also includes Sensei's Divining Top and Counterbalance to control the top of the opponent's library. The win condition is usually through casting Entreat the Angels or using Jace to ultimate for a win."
