            "notes": "The deck focuses on playing powerful creatures like Siege Rhino and Wingmate Roc while disrupting the opponent with Thoughtseize and removal spells like Hero's Downfall. The mana base is optimized for consistency with cards like Sylvan Caryatid and Courser of Kruphix helping to fix mana and gain life. The Planeswalkers Ajani, Mentor of Heroes, Elspeth, Sun's Champion, and Sorin, Solemn Visitor provide additional value and threats. The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board presence to overwhelm opponents before they can stabilize."
