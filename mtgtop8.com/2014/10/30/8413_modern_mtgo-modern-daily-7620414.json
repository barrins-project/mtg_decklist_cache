Cards like Delver of Secrets, Young Pyromancer, and Snapcaster Mage are key in establishing a strong early game presence. The deck also employs cards like Lightning Bolt, Electrolyze, and Forked Bolt to control the board and deal direct damage to the opponent. The deck's reliance on cantrips, counterspells, and card draw effects like Serum Visions and Treasure Cruise ensures consistency and the ability to refill your hand quickly."
