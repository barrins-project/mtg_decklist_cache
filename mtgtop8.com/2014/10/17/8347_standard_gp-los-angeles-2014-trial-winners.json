With a focus on the Abzan color combination, this deck aims to curve out with powerful threats like Siege Rhino and Wingmate Roc, backed up by disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Hero's Downfall. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Sorin, Solemn Visitor adds additional resilience and card advantage to keep the pressure on opponents. This Abzan Aggro deck is designed to overwhelm opponents quickly and efficiently."
