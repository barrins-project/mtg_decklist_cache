Focus on disrupting your opponent's game plan with counterspells, hand disruption, and removal while generating card advantage with cards like Dig Through Time. Use powerful threats like Nissa, Worldwaker and Reaper of the Wilds to pressure opponents and close out the game. Make use of mana acceleration from cards like Sylvan Caryatid and Courser of Kruphix to ensure you can cast your spells efficiently. Prioritize setting up your mana base for consistent access to all colors."
