The deck focuses on maintaining card advantage and control over the game by using cards like Jeskai Charm, Deflecting Palm, and Mindswipe to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out the game. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent through smart decision-making and efficient use of resources."
