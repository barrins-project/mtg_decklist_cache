The deck focuses on playing efficient threats like Seeker of the Way, Mantis Rider, and Goblin Rabblemaster, while also utilizing direct damage spells such as Stoke the Flames, Lightning Strike, and Jeskai Charm to clear the way and finish off the opponent. The deck also includes some versatile planeswalkers like Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker and Chandra, Pyromaster to provide additional value and threats. Overall, the goal is to apply constant pressure and close out the game quickly."
