With this extra mana, the deck aims to play powerful green creatures like Polukranos, World Eater and Genesis Hydra to overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes control elements such as Doomwake Giant and Courser of Kruphix to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The inclusion of cards like Hornet Queen and Arbor Colossus provides additional threats and versatility in different matchups."
