            "notes": "The main concept of this Jeskai Aggro deck is to quickly establish board presence and pressure the opponent with aggressive creatures like Seeker of the Way, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Mantis Rider. The deck also includes burn spells like Lightning Strike and Stoke the Flames to control the board and deal direct damage to the opponent. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Chandra, Pyromaster and Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker provides additional threats and card advantage. Overall, the key strategy is to maintain a fast tempo and apply relentless pressure to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a strong defense."
