The deck also includes disruptive elements like Reclamation Sage and Wirewood Symbiote to interact with the opponent's game plan and protect the combo pieces. Overall, the deck focuses on creating a fast and explosive win condition through the synergy of its Elf creatures."

It utilizes cards like Terminus, Swords to Plowshares, Force of Will, and Counterspell to disrupt the opponent's plans and protect its own threats. The deck also includes Sensei's Divining Top and Counterbalance for card selection and to lock opponents out of casting spells. Finishers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Entreat the Angels, and Vendilion Clique help to close out games. Overall, this UWx Control deck aims to outmaneuver opponents and win through incremental advantage."
