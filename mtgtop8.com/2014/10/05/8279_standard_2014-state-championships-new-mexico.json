By controlling the board with spot removal and countering key threats while also applying pressure with powerful creatures like Mantis Rider and Goblin Rabblemaster, the deck aims to swiftly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. The inclusion of planeswalkers like Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker and Chandra, Pyromaster provide additional sources of damage and card advantage to help close out games. Additionally, cards like Dig Through Time help ensure consistency and card selection."
