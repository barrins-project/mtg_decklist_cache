The deck also includes disruption elements like Cabal Therapy and Duress to control the opponent's game plan and protect its own combo."

With the ability to tutor for specific creatures with Green Sun's Zenith and Natural Order, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of powerful elf creatures and win the game in just a few turns."

With a heavy emphasis on burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Price of Progress, combined with aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide and Eidolon of the Great Revel, the goal is to keep the pressure on the opponent and finish them off before they can stabilize. The fetch lands and Treasure Cruise provide some card advantage to ensure the deck can maintain its fast pace throughout the game."
