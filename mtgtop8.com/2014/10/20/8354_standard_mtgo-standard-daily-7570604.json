By utilizing cards like Satyr Hoplite, Monastery Swiftspear, and Foundry Street Denizen, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful attacks early on. Additionally, cards like Hammerhand and Dragon Mantle help to push through damage and trigger powerful abilities. With a focus on speed and aggression, this deck looks to quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
