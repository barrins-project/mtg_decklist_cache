It also aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Force of Will and Daze. The deck's win condition is to quickly deploy threats like True-Name Nemesis, Stoneforge Mystic, and Delver of Secrets, while also having access to powerful equipment like Umezawa's Jitte and Batterskull. The deck also includes land destruction cards like Wasteland to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain control throughout the game."
