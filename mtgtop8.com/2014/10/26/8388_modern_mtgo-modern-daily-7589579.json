By utilizing counter spells like Remand and Cryptic Command, along with removal like Lightning Bolt and Electrolyze, you can disrupt your opponent's strategy while ramping up your mana with cards like Search for Tomorrow and Sakura-Tribe Elder. Once you have enough lands in play, you can cast Scapeshift to quickly win the game by searching for multiple Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and mountains to deal massive damage to your opponent."
