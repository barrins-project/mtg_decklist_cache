The creatures in the deck, such as Goblin Rabblemaster, Butcher of the Horde, and Stormbreath Dragon, provide a powerful offense while also being resilient threats. The planeswalkers, Sorin and Sarkhan, provide additional sources of card advantage and removal. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can close out with its powerful threats."

The deck aims to control the board through cards like Polukranos, World Eater and Arbor Colossus, while also generating card advantage with Courser of Kruphix and Genesis Hydra. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker and Xenagos, the Reveler provides additional threats and ways to close out the game. Overall, the strategy revolves around ramping up mana quickly and overwhelming the opponent with powerful creatures and spells."
