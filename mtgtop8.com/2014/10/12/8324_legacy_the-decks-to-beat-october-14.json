The key strategy involves using Counterbalance and Sensei's Divining Top to control the top cards of the library, while also utilizing cards like Force of Will and Swords to Plowshares to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional card advantage and board control, allowing the player to out-value their opponent and secure victory through superior card quality and tempo advantage."

With a focus on speed and disruption, this deck aims to close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize.
