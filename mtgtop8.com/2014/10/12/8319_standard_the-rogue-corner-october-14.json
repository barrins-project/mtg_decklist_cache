            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to use Jeskai Ascendancy along with creatures like Rattleclaw Mystic and Sylvan Caryatid to generate infinite mana and draw through the deck using Retraction Helix and Dig Through Time. This combo allows for explosive turns and can potentially win the game in a single turn. The deck also includes support cards like Dragon Mantle and Briber's Purse to protect the combo pieces. Nissa, Worldwaker provides additional ramp and can create threats on the board. The deck focuses on efficiently assembling the combo pieces and overwhelming the opponent with card advantage and mana."
