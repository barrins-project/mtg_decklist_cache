It also utilizes powerful card draw and selection spells like Fact or Fiction and Deep Analysis to maintain a full hand of options. The deck's win condition is to either outlast opponents with card advantage or to disrupt the board state with an Upheaval, allowing for a strong follow-up play."

The deck includes powerful creatures like Flametongue Kavu and Psychatog, along with versatile spells such as Fact or Fiction and Fire / Ice. By carefully managing resources and answering threats efficiently, the deck can outlast opponents and eventually overwhelm them with card advantage and strong finishers. The key to success lies in navigating the early game to set up a strong late-game position."
