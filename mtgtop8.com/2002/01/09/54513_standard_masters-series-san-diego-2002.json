By utilizing a variety of counterspells, bounce spells, and card advantage engines, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through card advantage and incremental advantage. The Psychatog serves as a win condition that can quickly close out the game once the opponent's resources have been exhausted. The deck also includes a mix of lands to ensure consistent mana production and the ability to access all necessary colors."
