By using low-cost, efficient creatures like Wild Mongrel and Merfolk Looter, along with strong removal spells like Flame-tongue Kavu and Circular Logic, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and keep them on the back foot. The inclusion of cards like Basking Rootwalla and Arrogant Wurm also helps to maintain momentum and provide additional threats to keep the opponent on their toes."
