The key strategy is to stall the game with efficient removal like Path to Exile and board wipes like Terminus and Wrath of God, while using cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Search for Azcanta for card advantage. The goal is to outvalue the opponent and win the game through attrition, ultimately keeping the opponent's threats in check and dominating the late game with powerful spells."
