Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, while providing protection and evasion with cards like Mantis Rider and Kitesail Freebooter. The mana base is built to support a fast, aggressive strategy, making it difficult for opponents to keep up."

By using cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, Search for Azcanta, and Snapcaster Mage, the deck aims to out-value the opponent and prevent them from executing their game plan. The deck also has a mix of board wipes and burn spells to deal with threats efficiently. This archetype aims to grind the opponent out of resources and eventually win the game through incremental advantage."

The deck also aims to ramp up mana quickly with Utopia Sprawl and Arbor Elf while generating card advantage through cards like Tireless Tracker and Chandra, Torch of Defiance. The deck's finishers include powerful creatures like Inferno Titan and Stormbreath Dragon, backed up by a versatile threat like Bloodbraid Elf. Overall, the deck aims to control the game tempo and overwhelm opponents with its strong creatures."
