Field of Ruin and Detention Sphere help deal with problematic permanents, while cards like Snapcaster Mage and Search for Azcanta provide additional value and card selection.

It utilizes efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to control the board while employing hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's game plan. With cards like Young Pyromancer and Bedlam Reveler, the deck can quickly build a board presence and close out the game. The inclusion of Lingering Souls provides additional creature threats and resilience. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and disrupt the opponent's strategy to secure a fast victory."
