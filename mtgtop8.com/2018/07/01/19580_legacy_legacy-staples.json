The deck includes various ways to tutor for the combo pieces, disrupt the opponent's strategy with hand disruption and removal spells, and protect the combo with cards like Sylvan Safekeeper. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Dark Confidant and Sylvan Library to help draw into the combo pieces faster and maintain card advantage."
