It also includes countermagic like Spell Pierce and Force of Will to protect your combo pieces and disrupt your opponent's game plan.

The deck also includes disruption spells like Thoughtseize, Spell Pierce, and Daze to control the board and protect its threats. By using cards like Reanimate and Street Wraith to manipulate its life total, the deck can quickly power up a massive Death's Shadow for a game-ending swing. The deck also includes card draw spells like Brainstorm and Ponder to ensure consistency and keep the pressure on the opponent."
