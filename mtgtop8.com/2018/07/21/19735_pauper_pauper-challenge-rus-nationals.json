The mana base is built to support the aggressive strategy while also providing some lifegain and flexibility in casting spells."

The key strategy is to use cheap creatures like Delver of Secrets and Faerie Miscreant to pressure the opponent while countering their key spells with Counterspell and Spellstutter Sprite. Ninja of the Deep Hours is used for card advantage and tempo plays. The deck also includes card filtering and card draw spells like Brainstorm and Ponder to help find the right cards at the right time."
