By aggressively attacking with creatures such as Hazoret the Fervent, Goblin Chainwhirler, and Earthshaker Khenra, while also using burn spells like Lightning Strike, Abrade, and Shock to remove any blockers or threats, this deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can stabilize or mount a defense. The low mana curve and high damage output make this deck a formidable force in a 1 vs 1 Standard format."
