This triggers effects like Narcomoeba and Prized Amalgam to generate a swarm of creatures. Cabal Therapy is used for disruption, and Bridge from Below takes advantage of the constant graveyard presence. The deck also includes tools like Ichorid and Dread Return for additional recurring threats. Efficient card draw and mana fixing ensure consistent and explosive graveyard-based combos."
