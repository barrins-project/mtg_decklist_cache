Gifts Ungiven is used to search for key cards like Past in Flames to revive spells from the graveyard, while disruption spells like Remand and Repeal help to control the opponent's game plan. The goal is to assemble the combo pieces and win the game in a single explosive turn."

            "notes": "The main idea behind this deck is to quickly assemble a combo utilizing Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Scapeshift. By ramping up with cards like Farseek and Sakura-Tribe Elder, the goal is to get Valakut on the battlefield alongside enough Mountains to trigger its ability multiple times in a single turn. This can deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent, quickly ending the game. Primeval Titan can also help search for key pieces of the combo, increasing the deck's consistency and speed."
