The deck also aims to quickly fill up the graveyard with creatures using Minister of Inquiries and Stitcher's Supplier in order to activate Gate to the Afterlife and bring back powerful creatures with God-Pharaoh's Gift. The combination of control elements and graveyard recursion makes this deck a versatile and formidable opponent in a Standard 1 vs 1 format."
