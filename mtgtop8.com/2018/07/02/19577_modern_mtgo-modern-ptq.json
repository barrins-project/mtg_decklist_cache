The deck aims to dig for combo pieces using Ancient Stirrings and set up a big explosive turn to win the game. It prioritizes consistency and resilience to disruption in order to execute the combo successfully."

Blood Moon and Abrade provide additional disruption to slow down the opponent's mana base or key cards. Overall, the deck focuses on controlling the game until the pilot can secure a win condition with its powerful creatures and spells."
