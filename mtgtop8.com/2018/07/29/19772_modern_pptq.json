The deck aims to utilize mana acceleration from cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to power out threats like Master of Etherium and Arcbound Ravager early in the game. The inclusion of cards like Karn, Scion of Urza provides additional card advantage and utility in the mid to late game. With a mix of aggressive creatures and powerful artifacts, this deck aims to quickly close out games against opponents."

The addition of Madcap Experiment combo with Platinum Emperion provides a win condition that is difficult for many decks to deal with. The deck aims to stabilize the board with control cards and then take over the game with powerful planeswalkers and creatures. The mana base allows for consistent access to all necessary colors for the spells in the deck."

This allows you to quickly build up a strong and hard-to-stop army that can overwhelm your opponent before they have a chance to react. Additionally, Leyline of Sanctity provides protection from hand disruption and burn spells."
