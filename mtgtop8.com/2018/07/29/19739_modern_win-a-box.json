It aims to stall the opponent's game plan with counterspells, removal, and board wipes until it can stabilize and take over the game with its powerful threats. The deck's key strategy is to control the game's tempo and resource exchange, ultimately out-valuing the opponent by efficiently handling threats and generating card advantage."
