The deck focuses on playing disruptive creatures like Spell Queller while also boosting the strength of spirits with Drogskol Captain and Supreme Phantom. Collected Company allows for quick creature deployment, while Path to Exile handles threats from the opponent. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and allow for consistent plays, with a mix of fetch lands and dual lands."

The inclusion of cards like Collected Company and Voice of Resurgence offer additional value and disruption to the opponent's game plan. The deck also features land destruction elements with cards like Ghost Quarter and Field of Ruin. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with early threats while also having the ability to grind out value in longer games."
