The deck aims to dig for combo pieces such as Gifts Ungiven, Grapeshot, and Past in Flames to set up a game-winning storm turn. The inclusion of Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer helps to reduce the cost of spells, allowing the player to go off even faster and overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells."
