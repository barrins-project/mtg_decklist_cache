This is achieved through a combination of fast mana acceleration, card selection/filtering, disruption of the opponent's hand, and the ability to tutor for key pieces of the combo. The deck leverages cards like Dark Ritual, Burning Wish, and Infernal Tutor to generate mana and find crucial combo pieces, while also using discard spells like Thoughtseize and Duress to disrupt the opponent's game plan."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Stifle and Wasteland, while also maintaining card advantage and filtering through the deck with Ponder and Brainstorm. Overall, the strategy is to quickly deal damage and close out the game before the opponent can establish their own board presence."
