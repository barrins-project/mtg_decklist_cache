This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of Elves and finish them off with a massive damage output from cards like Ezuri, Renegade Leader and Lead the Stampede. The inclusion of cards like Cavern of Souls and Pendelhaven help to protect the Elves and ensure the combo can go off smoothly."
