The goal is to dig for combo pieces with cantrips like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand, and eventually assemble a lethal Grapeshot or Past in Flames combo. Gifts Ungiven helps search for key cards in the deck, and the deck runs a low land count to ensure a high density of spells for maximum storm potential."
