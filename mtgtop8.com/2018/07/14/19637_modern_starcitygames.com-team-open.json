The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a consistent stream of threats while also having disruption and removal in the form of Lightning Bolt and Collective Brutality. The combination of speed, graveyard synergies, and strong creatures make this Aggro-Hollow One deck a formidable force in Modern 1 vs 1 matches."
