By quickly building a board presence with cards like Steel Overseer and Master of Etherium, and boosting their power with Cranial Plating, the deck aims to deal large amounts of damage in a short amount of time. Combining aggressive creatures with utility cards like Galvanic Blast for removal and Springleaf Drum for mana acceleration, this deck is designed to apply pressure and close out games quickly."
