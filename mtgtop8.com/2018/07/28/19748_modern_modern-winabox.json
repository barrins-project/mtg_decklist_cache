The deck is heavily reliant on artifacts and sacrifice effects to generate value and eventually win the game through a large Explosive turn or grinding out opponents advantage. The deck also runs multiple ways to tutor for key combo pieces like Ancient Stirrings and Inventors' Fair to ensure consistency in executing the combo."
