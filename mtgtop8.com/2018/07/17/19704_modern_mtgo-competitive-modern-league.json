By using cards like Mishra's Bauble and Street Wraith to draw cards and lower your life total, along with Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt your opponent's game plan, you can unleash large Death's Shadows that can end the game in just a few turns. The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay to deal with opposing threats, while cards like Kolaghan's Command provide additional value and disruption."
