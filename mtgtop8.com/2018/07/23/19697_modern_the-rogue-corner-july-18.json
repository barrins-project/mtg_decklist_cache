With cards like Glorybringer, Thunderbreak Regent, and Stormbreath Dragon, the deck aims to quickly overpower opponents. Control elements such as Blood Moon, Skred, and Lightning Bolt are used to disrupt opponent strategies and maintain board control. Additionally, cards like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Sarkhan, Fireblood provide extra card advantage and mana acceleration. The deck's strategy revolves around efficiently removing threats while deploying powerful creatures to close out the game."
