By leveraging cards like The Antiquities War, Ensoul Artifact, and Karn, Scion of Urza, along with disruption from Force of Will and Chalice of the Void, the deck aims to control the game tempo and pressure the opponent into making suboptimal plays. The inclusion of Etched Champion and Walking Ballista provides additional versatility and resilience in combat situations, while the mana base supports a consistent and fast deployment of threats."
