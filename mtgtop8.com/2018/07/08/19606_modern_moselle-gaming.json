By playing efficient creatures like Wild Nacatl, Kird Ape, and Goblin Guide, and combining them with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Atarka's Command, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Additionally, cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Path to Exile help control the opponent's board and protect your own creatures. The deck's mana base is optimized to support its aggressive playstyle and ensure consistent casting of spells."
