The ultimate goal is to combo off with Scapeshift and Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent's creatures or directly to their face. Cards like Primeval Titan can also help fetch Valakut and ramp up the damage output. The deck aims to efficiently assemble its combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with its powerful win condition."
