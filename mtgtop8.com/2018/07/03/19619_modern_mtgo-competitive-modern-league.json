The deck focuses on dealing direct damage to the opponent using cards like Lightning Bolt and Wizard's Lightning, while also maintaining card advantage through cards like Opt and Serum Visions. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Adeliz, the Cinder Wind and Stormchaser Mage further enhances the deck's aggressive strategy, making it a fast-paced and formidable opponent in Modern 1 vs 1 matches."
