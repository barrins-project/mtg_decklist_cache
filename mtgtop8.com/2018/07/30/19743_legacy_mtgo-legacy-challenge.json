Lightning Bolt provides additional removal and reach, while Wasteland helps to disrupt opponent's mana base.

It efficiently manipulates the top of the library with cards like Brainstorm and Portent to set up powerful plays, while also running a suite of counterspells like Force of Will and Counterspell to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Council's Judgment handle threats on the board, with the goal of grinding out the opponent and overpowering them in the late game."
