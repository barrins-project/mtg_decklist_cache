Leyline of Sanctity protects against targeted disruption, while Spirit Link provides lifegain and Hyena Umbra offers protection and additional value.

By efficiently using cards like Bloodbraid Elf, Tarmogoyf, and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and maintain a strong board presence throughout the game. Liliana of the Veil and Thoughtseize provide disruption to the opponent's strategy, while cards like Kolaghan's Command and Maelstrom Pulse help in dealing with opposing threats. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's aggressive game plan."
