By efficiently using cards like Nicol Bolas, the Ravager and The Scarab God, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and close out games quickly. The inclusion of versatile cards like Commit / Memory and Supreme Will allows for flexibility in different situations, while cards like Glint-Sleeve Siphoner provide additional card draw to keep the aggression going. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency in casting spells of all three colors."
