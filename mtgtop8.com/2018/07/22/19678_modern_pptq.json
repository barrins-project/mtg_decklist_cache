The deck also includes a few planeswalkers like Tezzeret and Karn to provide additional threats and card advantage. The deck's synergy and fast pace make it a formidable aggro deck in the Modern format."

It utilizes a mix of removal spells, counterspells, and versatile creatures like Snapcaster Mage to control the board. The key strategy is to stabilize the board with removal and counterspells, while generating card advantage with cards like Search for Azcanta and Cryptic Command. The deck also has powerful finishers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Celestial Colonnade to close out the game once it has gained control."
