The key is to establish a board presence early on, maintain card advantage, and combo off to win the game before the opponent can respond effectively. The deck aims to win quickly and decisively through a combination of mana acceleration and powerful Elf synergies."

It also includes disruption with cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to control the opponent's hand. The inclusion of powerful removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Kolaghan's Command helps to clear the way for your creatures to attack. In addition, cards like Blood Moon can disrupt certain strategies and give you an advantage. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of speed, disruption, and aggression."
