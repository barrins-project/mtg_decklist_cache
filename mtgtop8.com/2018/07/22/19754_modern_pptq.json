This strategy allows the deck to apply consistent pressure on the opponent while being difficult to interact with due to the Hexproof ability granted by the Auras."

This allows the player to cast powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine, Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The deck also includes removal and disruption spells like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus to control the game and protect its threats. The deck aims to outvalue and outlast its opponent with its powerful late-game threats and control elements."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck revolves around assembling the combo of Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle and Scapeshift to quickly deal a large amount of damage to the opponent. The deck includes cards like Prismatic Omen to ensure all lands count as mountains and ramp spells like Farseek and Sakura-Tribe Elder to quickly reach the required number of mountains for Valakut's ability to trigger. Primeval Titan can also tutor for Valakut or additional lands, while cards like Sweltering Suns provide board control. This combo-driven archetype aims to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful finish."
