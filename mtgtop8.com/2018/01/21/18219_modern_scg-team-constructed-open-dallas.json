The deck includes powerful Human creatures such as Thalia's Lieutenant and Mantis Rider, which can quickly grow in size and deal significant damage. The inclusion of disruptive creatures like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter adds a control element, preventing opponents from executing their own strategies. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a relentless onslaught of aggressive Human creatures."
