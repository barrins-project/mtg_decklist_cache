By overwhelming the opponent with tokens, the deck aims to apply pressure and quickly close out the game. Additionally, there are powerful flyers like Glyph Keeper and Angel of Sanctions to provide additional threats and control options. The deck also includes some graveyard recursion with cards like Champion of Wits and Sunscourge Champion to maintain card advantage and board presence. With a mix of aggression and control, this deck aims to outpace and overpower opponents in a Standard 1 vs 1 format."
