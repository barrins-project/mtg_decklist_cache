Glimpse of Nature and Wirewood Symbiote allow for card draw and bouncing creatures for additional mana generation. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Leovold, Emissary of Trest and Reclamation Sage to disrupt opponents while building up its own board presence with efficient Elf creatures. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a large, buffed-up army of Elves for a game-winning swing."

The deck aims to quickly assemble key combo pieces such as Craterhoof Behemoth or Ruric Thar, the Unbowed using cards like Natural Order and Green Sun's Zenith. By utilizing various elvish creatures like Nettle Sentinel and Quirion Ranger, the deck can maintain card advantage with cards like Glimpse of Nature while also disrupting the opponent with cards like Deathrite Shaman and Leovold, Emissary of Trest."
