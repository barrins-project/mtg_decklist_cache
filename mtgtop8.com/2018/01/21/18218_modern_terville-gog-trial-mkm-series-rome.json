With cards like Nettle Sentinel, Heritage Druid, and Elvish Archdruid, the deck can generate large amounts of mana and play multiple Elves in a single turn. Cards like Devoted Druid and Ezuri, Renegade Leader help pump up the Elves and give them trample, while cards like Collected Company and Chord of Calling help find key pieces for the combo. Craterhoof Behemoth can quickly overrun the opponent with a huge power boost."
