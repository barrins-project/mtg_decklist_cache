It also includes disruption elements like Thoughtseize, Cabal Therapy, and Pithing Needle to control the opponent's game plan. Additionally, there are cards for card advantage and utility like Sylvan Library and Ramunap Excavator. The deck aims to quickly generate a 20/20 Marit Lage token by removing the ice counters from Dark Depths, putting immense pressure on the opponent and potentially winning the game in a single swing."
