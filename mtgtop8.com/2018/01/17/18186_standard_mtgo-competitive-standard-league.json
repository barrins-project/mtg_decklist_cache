By using cards like Thunderherd Migration and Drover of the Mighty, the deck can accelerate its mana production and play big threats like Ghalta, Primal Hunger and Carnage Tyrant. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive dinosaur creatures while also having protection cards like Blossoming Defense and Savage Stomp to deal with threats. The key strategy is to quickly build a board presence and beat down the opponent before they can stabilize."
