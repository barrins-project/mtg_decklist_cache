By using cards like Vizier of Remedies and Devoted Druid, the deck can generate infinite mana to fuel strong creature plays, while cards like Spell Queller provide disruption and protection. The toolbox aspect of the deck allows for flexibility and adaptability to different board states and matchups, providing a strategic advantage in a 1 vs 1 format."
