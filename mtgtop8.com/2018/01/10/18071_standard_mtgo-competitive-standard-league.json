The primary win conditions of the deck are Torrential Gearhulk and The Scarab God, both of which can provide strong late-game value. The deck aims to control the game by denying the opponent's threats and eventually overpowering them with its powerful creatures and removal spells. The inclusion of cards like Commit / Memory and Liliana, Death's Majesty adds additional flexibility and resilience to the deck's game plan."
