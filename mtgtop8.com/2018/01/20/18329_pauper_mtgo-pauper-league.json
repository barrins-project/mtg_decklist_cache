This allows for the casting of powerful creatures like Ulamog's Crusher and Fangren Marauder, while also utilizing cards like Crop Rotation and Ancient Stirrings to search for key pieces. Prophetic Prism and Chromatic Star/Sphere help with fixing mana and drawing cards, while Pulse of Murasa provides recursion. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with big threats and outvalue them through efficient ramp and card advantage."
