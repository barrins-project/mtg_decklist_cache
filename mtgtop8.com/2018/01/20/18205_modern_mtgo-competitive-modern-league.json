The deck aims to draw through the library efficiently with cards like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to find key combo pieces like Grapeshot and Past in Flames. Gifts Ungiven is used to tutor for specific cards, while Remand and Unsubstantiate help to protect the combo. Ultimately, the deck aims to generate a lethal storm count and finish with a massive Grapeshot."
