With the ability to tutor for creatures using Green Sun's Zenith and Natural Order, the deck aims to combo off and overwhelm the opponent with a large number of Elves. Cards like Craterhoof Behemoth provide a powerful finisher, while utility creatures like Reclamation Sage and Scavenging Ooze help deal with problematic permanents and graveyard strategies. The deck's mana base is optimized for producing green mana and maximizing the potential of Gaea's Cradle."

The deck also utilizes synergy between Elves such as Wirewood Symbiote and Nettle Sentinel to generate additional mana and card advantage. It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large army of creatures and close out the game with a massive Craterhoof Behemoth attack."
