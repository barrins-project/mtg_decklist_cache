The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan and prevent them from gaining life or stabilizing. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to the deck's key colors of red and white."

            "notes": "The main idea of this Abzan Aggro deck is to disrupt the opponent's game plan using spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, while also controlling the board with removal spells such as Path to Exile and Fatal Push. At the same time, the deck aims to apply pressure with efficient threats like Tarmogoyf, Siege Rhino, and Grim Flayer. Lingering Souls provides additional threats and card advantage, while cards like Scavenging Ooze and Liliana, the Last Hope provide additional value and graveyard interaction. Overall, the deck aims to have a proactive game plan while disrupting the opponent's strategy."
