The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures while using cards like Thoughtcast to draw into more threats. Cards like Galvanic Blast and Fling provide reach to close out the game, while Metallic Rebuke and Temur Battle Rage offer disruption and additional damage. The combination of fast mana sources and cheap threats allows this deck to quickly apply pressure and force opponents to react."
