It aims to lock down the opponent's graveyard with Rest in Peace and prevent opponent's lands from tapping for mana with Back to Basics. The win condition is to either mill the opponent with Helm of Obedience or create an army of angels with Luminarch Ascension. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and manipulation, while Engineered Explosives and Supreme Verdict help maintain board control. The deck plays a patient and reactive game, waiting for the right moment to strike."

            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to utilize the graveyard as a resource to quickly fill it with cards through dredge mechanics. By milling cards and discarding cards, the deck can quickly generate creatures, trigger abilities of cards like Bridge from Below, and set up game-winning combos. The deck is able to quickly overwhelm opponents with a large number of creatures and synergistic interactions from the graveyard. This strategy relies on speed and efficiency to outmaneuver the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to respond."
