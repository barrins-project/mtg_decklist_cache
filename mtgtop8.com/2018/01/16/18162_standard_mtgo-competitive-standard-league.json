            "notes": "This deck focuses on controlling the board while utilizing God-Pharaoh's Gift to reanimate powerful creatures from the graveyard. By using cards like Minister of Inquiries and Trophy Mage to fill the graveyard and find key pieces, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures like Angel of Invention and Hostage Taker. Glint-Nest Crane and Glint-Sleeve Siphoner help with card advantage, while Fatal Push and Aethersphere Harvester provide removal and protection. The key strategy is to outvalue the opponent with efficient creatures and carefully planned reanimations."
