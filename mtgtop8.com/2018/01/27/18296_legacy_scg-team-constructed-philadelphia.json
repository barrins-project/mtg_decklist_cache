It aims to control the tempo of the game by using cards like Terminus, Swords to Plowshares, and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to handle threats from the opponent. The deck also utilizes Search for Azcanta for card selection and Unexpectedly Absent for additional removal. With a mix of control elements like Force of Will and Counterbalance, this deck aims to outmaneuver opponents and secure victory through card advantage and precise decision-making."
