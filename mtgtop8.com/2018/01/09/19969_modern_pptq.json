These low-cost creatures benefit from tribal synergies to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Spell Queller and Mausoleum Wanderer to control the opponent's spells while building up its own board presence. The mana base ensures consistent access to the necessary colors while maximizing the potential of cards like Collected Company. This deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain its advantage throughout the game."

It utilizes cards like Vines of Vastwood and Mutagenic Growth to protect and enhance its creatures, while also including pump spells like Might of Old Krosa and Groundswell to push through lethal damage. By combining efficient creatures with powerful pump spells and protection, this deck aims to win the game in just a few turns by accumulating enough poison counters on the opponent."
