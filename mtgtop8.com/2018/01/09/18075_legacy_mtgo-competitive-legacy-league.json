The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with removal spells such as Swords to Plowshares and Terminus, while also setting up a win condition with Entreat the Angels. The deck also utilizes cards like Search for Azcanta and Predict to filter through the deck and find key cards when needed."
