By utilizing a combination of cheap creatures like Sacred Cat and Seeker of the Way, along with powerful auras like Ethereal Armor and Hyena Umbra, the deck aims to create a fast and aggressive board presence. The inclusion of protection spells like Cho-Manno's Blessing and Benevolent Bodyguard allows for protection against removal spells, while cards like Defiant Strike and Mutagenic Growth provide additional ways to buff up the creatures and push through damage."

The deck also includes various control spells like Counterspells, removal, and card draw to disrupt the opponent's plans and maintain board control. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with superior resources and eventually win through powerful finishers or by grinding out a victory through attrition."
