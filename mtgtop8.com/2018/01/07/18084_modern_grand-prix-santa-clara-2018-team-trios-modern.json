By utilizing cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Thoughtseize to disrupt their game plan, the deck aims to lock the opponent out of the game and prevent them from drawing relevant cards. The deck also includes a variety of artifact and land cards to support its strategy and ensure consistency in achieving its goal of controlling the game."
