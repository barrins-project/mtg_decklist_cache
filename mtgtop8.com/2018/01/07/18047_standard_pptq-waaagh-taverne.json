The tokens generated allow for efficient aggro plays, overwhelming the opponent with multiple creatures.

The inclusion of removal spells like Fairgrounds Warden and Angel of Sanctions help maintain board control. Overall, the deck aims to swarm the battlefield with tokens, creating a powerful army to pressure the opponent and secure victory."

Search for Azcanta provides additional card selection and filtering, while Vraska's Contempt deals with problematic creatures or planeswalkers. The deck aims to control the pace of the game and win through attrition and card advantage."
