The inclusion of control elements like Essence Scatter and Torrential Gearhulk allows for flexibility in handling threats, while cards like The Scarab God and Hostage Taker provide additional value by reusing opponent's creatures. Finally, Vraska's Contempt offers excellent removal for problematic threats."
