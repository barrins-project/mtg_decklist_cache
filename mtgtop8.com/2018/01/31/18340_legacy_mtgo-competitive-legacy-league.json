The key strategy revolves around recurring lands with Life from the Loam and Punishing Fire to control the board and grind out advantages. Knight of the Reliquary and Green Sun's Zenith help tutor for important cards while also providing a strong board presence. The deck also has a land combo with Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage as a win condition. Overall, the deck aims to control the game through resource denial and versatile threats."
