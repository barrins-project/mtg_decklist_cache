With efficient removal spells like Galvanic Blast and a potential finisher in Temur Battle Rage or Fling, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and burst damage. The synergies between artifacts and sacrifice effects with Disciple of the Vault and Krark-Clan Shaman are key to achieving victory in this fast-paced Pauper format."
