The deck also aims to apply pressure with efficient threats such as Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Scavenging Ooze and Collective Brutality to gain incremental advantages and disrupt graveyard strategies. Overall, the deck seeks to control the board while applying pressure to quickly close out the game."
