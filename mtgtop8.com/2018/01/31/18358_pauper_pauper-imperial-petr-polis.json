            "notes": "The main idea of this Boros Aggro deck is to maintain a fast and aggressive pace by using low-cost creatures like Thraben Inspector and Kor Skyfisher, along with efficient spells like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt. The deck also includes artifact creatures and cantrips like Prophetic Prism and Ichor Wellspring to generate card advantage and ensure a steady flow of threats. Additionally, cards like Battle Screech and Rally the Peasants provide additional reach and can quickly close out games. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a consistent stream of damage and pressure."
