This deck utilizes cards like Sylvan Scrying, Expedition Map, Crop Rotation, and Vampire Hexmage to search for and assemble the combo pieces efficiently. It also includes disruption in the form of Thoughtseize, Duress, and Pithing Needle to protect the combo from disruption from the opponent. The deck aims to win the game quickly by creating a powerful Marit Lage token."

The deck also utilizes card draw and manipulation with Ponder, Brainstorm, and Gitaxian Probe to ensure consistency. Additionally, the inclusion of disruptive land destruction with Wasteland further controls the pace of the game."

It also utilizes powerful sideboard cards like Rest in Peace and Helm of Obedience to shut down graveyard-based strategies. The deck aims to stabilize the board with cards like Supreme Verdict and Engineered Explosives, while utilizing card draw and selection with Brainstorm and Ponder. The mana base is structured to have access to all necessary colors while also minimizing vulnerability to non-basic land hate."
