By using these tools to control the game and slow down the opponent's game plan, the deck looks to establish dominance in the late game and secure victory."

Chalice of the Void helps disrupt opponents, while Walking Ballista offers versatile removal. All Is Dust can clear the board, and Karn Liberated provides additional removal and disruption. The deck is designed to apply early pressure and overwhelm opponents with powerful threats before they can establish their game plan. Overall, the strategy is to quickly deploy big Eldrazi threats and disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining board control."
