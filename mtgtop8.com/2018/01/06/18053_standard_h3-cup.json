The deck aims to quickly build up energy counters to power up cards like Bristling Hydra and Confiscation Coup, while also having powerful late-game threats like Glorybringer and Chandra, Torch of Defiance to close out the game. Overall, the deck focuses on being proactive and applying pressure to the opponent."
