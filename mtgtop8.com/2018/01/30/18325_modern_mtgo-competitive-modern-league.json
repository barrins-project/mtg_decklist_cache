The deck also utilizes control elements like Oblivion Stone and Dismember to manage the board and Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to ensure consistent access to the Tron lands. Overall, the strategy revolves around controlling the game until it can drop one of its powerful threats to seal the victory."
