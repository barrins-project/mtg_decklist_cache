Using cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, you can deploy threats quickly and overwhelm your opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of Galvanic Blast provides direct removal for key threats, while Etched Champion and Vault Skirge provide resilience and protection against opposing removal spells. The deck aims to close out the game swiftly and aggressively."
