The deck also includes a suite of cantrips and counterspells to help dig for combo pieces and protect the combo. The inclusion of Faerie Miscreant and Spellstutter Sprite helps provide additional creature presence and disruption, while Ninja of the Deep Hours offers card advantage and additional pressure. The mana base is streamlined for consistency with mostly Snow-Covered Plains and Islands."
