Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer reduce the cost of spells, while Gifts Ungiven helps search for combo pieces. Past in Flames allows for spell recursion, while Remand provides both disruption and card draw. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of spells and win the game in a single explosive turn."
