Pact of Negation provides protection for the combo, ensuring the opponent cannot disrupt your game-winning play. The key strategy is to carefully manage your life total and resources to execute the combo effectively."

The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast and large threats, utilizing the Eldrazi Temple and Urza lands for mana acceleration. Additionally, Sea Gate Wreckage provides card advantage in longer matches. Overall, the deck is aggressive and aims to win quickly with its powerful creatures."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing Lantern of Insight and Codex Shredder to control the opponent's draws and prevent them from playing their key cards. It also includes various cards like Ensnaring Bridge, Thoughtseize, and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's strategy and protect against threats. The deck aims to lock down the opponent's options and grind out a win through attrition and resource denial. Additionally, cards like Whir of Invention and Mox Opal provide additional utility and acceleration to further solidify the control aspect of the deck."
