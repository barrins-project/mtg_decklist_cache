The key strategy is to exploit the high power level of these creatures through the use of Omniscience, allowing for multiple big plays in a single turn. The deck includes a suite of cantrips and counterspells to enable consistent and protected combo execution, with additional backup plans in the form of Force of Will to disrupt opposing strategies."
