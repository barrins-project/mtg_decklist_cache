The deck aims to flood the board with cheap Elf creatures like Elvish Vanguard and Lys Alana Huntmaster, while using Quirion Ranger and Timberwatch Elf to create powerful synergies and pump up the team. Lead the Stampede helps refill the hand and maintain pressure, while Viridian Longbow offers a way to deal with opposing threats. This deck relies on speed and synergy to outpace and overpower the opponent."
