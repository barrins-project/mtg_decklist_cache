The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent by constantly attacking with creatures and finishing them off with burn spells if necessary. The inclusion of cards like Soul-Scar Mage and Ahn-Crop Crasher reinforces the deck's aggressive strategy, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize and turn the game in their favor."
