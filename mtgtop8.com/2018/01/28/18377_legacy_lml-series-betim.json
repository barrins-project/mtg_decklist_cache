The deck has a lot of ways to tutor for the necessary pieces, protect the combo from disruption with cards like Duress and Thoughtseize, and generate mana quickly with cards like Lotus Petal and Elvish Spirit Guide. The deck is focused on executing the combo as fast as possible and overwhelming the opponent with a powerful threat that can end the game in just a few turns."

By using burn spells like Chain Lightning and Lightning Bolt, the deck can finish off the opponent quickly. The mana base is optimized for consistency and speed, allowing the deck to play aggressively and close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
