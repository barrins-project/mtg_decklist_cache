It also utilizes powerful creatures like True-Name Nemesis and Leovold, Emissary of Trest to apply pressure and close out the game quickly. Additionally, it has card advantage engines like Baleful Strix and Snapcaster Mage to help maintain a steady stream of resources. The mana base is optimized for consistency and includes utility lands like Wasteland to disrupt opposing mana bases."
