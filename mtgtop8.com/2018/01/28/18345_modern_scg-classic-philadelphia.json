The deck also utilizes mana acceleration with cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, allowing for explosive early-game plays. The inclusion of cards like Etched Champion and Vault Skirge offer protection and lifelink, respectively, while cards like Galvanic Blast provide reach and removal. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of aggressive artifact creatures."

With a combination of aggressive spells like Opt, Fatal Push, and Kolaghan's Command, along with disruption cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, the deck aims to control the game while building up a large Death's Shadow. Supporting cards like Snapcaster Mage and Gurmag Angler provide additional threats to keep the pressure on the opponent."
