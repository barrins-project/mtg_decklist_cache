Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Deathrite Shaman and Loam can provide additional utility and flexibility in different matchups."

            "notes": "The deck aims to quickly assemble the Dark Depths combo by using cards like Crop Rotation, Sylvan Scrying, and Expedition Map to find Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage. It also includes ways to protect the combo piece, such as Sylvan Safekeeper and Pithing Needle, as well as disruptive cards like Duress and Thoughtseize to control the opponent's hand. The deck can generate mana quickly with cards like Lotus Petal and Elvish Spirit Guide, enabling a fast win condition by creating a 20/20 Marit Lage token with Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage."
