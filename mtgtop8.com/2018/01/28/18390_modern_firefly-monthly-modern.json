The deck aims to maintain card advantage through cards like Serum Visions and Cryptic Command, while also having reach with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lightning Helix. The mana base allows for flexibility in casting spells of all three colors efficiently, and Celestial Colonnade serves as a late-game win condition. Overall, the deck focuses on tempo and aggression to overwhelm the opponent."
