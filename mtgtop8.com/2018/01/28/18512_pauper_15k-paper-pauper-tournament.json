By using cards like Counterspell and Forbidden Alchemy to control the board, along with removal spells like Doom Blade and Devour Flesh to deal with threats, the deck aims to out-value the opponent with powerful finishers like Gurmag Angler and Mulldrifter. The deck also utilizes bounce lands like Dimir Aqueduct for mana efficiency and card advantage, while also incorporating cantrips like Preordain for card selection and consistency. The goal is to dominate the game and grind out wins through smart plays and resource management."

The inclusion of counterspells and cantrips provide additional control and consistency to the deck's game plan, allowing it to disrupt the opponent's strategy while advancing its own win condition."
