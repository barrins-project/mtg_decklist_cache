The deck can lock down the opponent's threats with Oblivion Stone and All Is Dust, while also having access to powerful finishers like Ugin, the Spirit Dragon and Emrakul, the Promised End. The deck's consistency comes from cards like Sylvan Scrying and Ancient Stirrings to find key pieces like Tron lands and threats."

By using cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to control the opponent's hand and Fatal Push and Terminate to remove threats, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and finish them off with big creatures like Gurmag Angler and Death's Shadow. With a low land count and a high density of spells, the deck is designed to be aggressive and disruptive in the early turns of the game."

The deck also includes ways to control the board and generate card advantage, while utilizing powerful creatures like Primeval Titan and Huntmaster of the Fells to apply pressure. The key to winning with this deck is to efficiently ramp up to the combo and overwhelm the opponent with a barrage of burn damage."
