The deck aims to out-value opponents by efficiently managing resources and manipulating the top of the deck with cards like Counterbalance and Predict. This is supported by powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and win conditions like Entreat the Angels. The mana base is designed to support its three-color identity while maximizing consistency in casting spells."

The deck also includes disruption cards like Cabal Therapy and Duress to disrupt the opponent's game plan while digging for key pieces with cards like Brainstorm and Ponder. Burning Wish is used to search for additional combo pieces or answers to specific threats. The goal is to efficiently generate storm count and overwhelm the opponent before they can react."
