Once God-Pharaoh's Gift is in play, the deck can start bringing back powerful creatures from the graveyard to overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes control elements like Hostage Taker and Ravenous Chupacabra to deal with threats on the opponent's side of the field. The key strategy is to establish board control and maintain pressure with powerful reanimated creatures."
