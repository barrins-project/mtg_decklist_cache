            "notes": "The main strategy of this deck is to flood the board with tokens and creatures to overwhelm the opponent quickly. Cards like Legion's Landing and Anointed Procession are used to generate multiple tokens, while Fumigate and River's Rebuke provide board control. Vizier of the Anointed and Champion of Wits help with card advantage and digging through the deck. The deck also includes removal spells like Ixalan's Binding and Skywhaler's Shot to deal with threats. Overall, the deck focuses on aggression and creating a wide board presence to pressure the opponent."
