By utilizing creatures with high power and low cost, such as Steel Leaf Champion and Scrapheap Scrounger, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Additionally, cards like Thrashing Brontodon and Heart of Kiran provide extra utility and resilience against removal spells. The deck's aggressive strategy is further supported by cards like Ghalta, Primal Hunger and Rhonas the Indomitable, which can quickly close out the game if left unchecked."
