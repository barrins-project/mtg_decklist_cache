By efficiently protecting and enhancing our creatures, we can keep up the pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Using card draw and selection spells helps us find our key cards and keep a consistent pace throughout the game. Ultimately, the goal is to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent to secure a swift victory."
