It also utilizes card draw and recursion through cards like Mulldrifter and Mnemonic Wall to maintain a steady flow of resources. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by generating strong incremental advantages through card advantage and efficient mana usage, while stalling the game with defensive spells until it can secure a win condition, such as a massive Rolling Thunder or repeated Ghostly Flicker loops."
