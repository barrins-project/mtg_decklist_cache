With cards like Assault Strobe, Temur Battle Rage, and Titan's Strength, the goal is to surprise the opponent with unexpected bursts of damage and overwhelm them before they have a chance to stabilize. The deck also includes a mix of burn spells like Lightning Bolt and pump spells like Mutagenic Growth to support the aggressive game plan."
