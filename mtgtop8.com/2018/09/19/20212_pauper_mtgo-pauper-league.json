It utilizes control elements like counterspells and removal to control the board and stall the game until it can establish its powerful board presence. The deck also has recursion and card advantage tools to outvalue the opponent in the late game. Overall, the key concept is to use Urza's lands effectively to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with powerful spells and creatures."
