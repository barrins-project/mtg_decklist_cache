The deck includes cards that allow for efficient mana generation and card draw, as well as disruptive elements like Duress and Cabal Therapy to protect the combo. Burning Wish provides flexibility in accessing additional combo pieces from the sideboard. The key strategy is to sequence spells carefully to create a lethal storm count and overwhelm the opponent."

It also aims to create card advantage through cards like Brainstorm and Stoneforge Mystic to search for key equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte. The deck can also apply pressure with creatures like Delver of Secrets and True-Name Nemesis. The mana base is focused on maximizing consistency and disruption with cards like Wasteland. The ultimate goal is to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent while maintaining control of the game."
