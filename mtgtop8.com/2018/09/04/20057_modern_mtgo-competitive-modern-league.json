            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing Jeskai Ascendancy to create a combo that allows for powerful and explosive plays. By using mana creatures like Sylvan Caryatid and Birds of Paradise, along with various mana fixing lands and cantrips, the deck aims to generate enough mana and card draw to fuel the combo. Fatestitcher is used to untap lands and creatures to generate even more mana, creating a loop that can quickly overwhelm the opponent. The deck also includes interaction like Swan Song and Path to Exile to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
