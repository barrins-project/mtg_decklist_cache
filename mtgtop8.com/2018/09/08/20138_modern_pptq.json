The key strategy is to maximize the power of Champion of the Parish by playing a high density of Humans and using cards like Thalia's Lieutenant to pump the team. Aether Vial allows for instant speed creature deployment, while disruptive creatures like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with an aggressive and evasive creature-based strategy."

            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly deal damage to the opponent with aggressive, low-cost spells and creatures. By using efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, along with creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game and finish them off before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Boros Charm and Lightning Helix adds versatility and the ability to deal direct damage or protect your own creatures."
