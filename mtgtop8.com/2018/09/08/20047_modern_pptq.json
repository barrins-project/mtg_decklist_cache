The key strategy is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Cryptic Command and Remand, while removing threats with spells like Lightning Bolt and Abrade. Additionally, the deck utilizes card advantage and card selection with Serum Visions, Opt, and Snapcaster Mage to ensure consistency in drawing answers. The win condition of the deck revolves around flipping Thing in the Ice or using Jace, the Mind Sculptor to control the game and close out the match."
