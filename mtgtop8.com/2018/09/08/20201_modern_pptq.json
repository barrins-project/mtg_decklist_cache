Protection spells like Spell Pierce and Blossoming Defense help ensure the creatures stick around long enough to deal lethal infect damage. The goal is to quickly build up a lethal infect count and overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a defense."

The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly with a combination of fast creatures like Vault Skirge and Signal Pest, while also having resilience with cards like Etched Champion and Welding Jar.
