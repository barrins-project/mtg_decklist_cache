The inclusion of cards like Restoration Angel and Flickerwisp provides additional value by allowing for flicker effects and creating combat trick opportunities. Overall, the deck aims to control the game tempo and win through efficient creature combat and disruptive elements."

By utilizing efficient creatures like Goblin Guide, Wild Nacatl, and Goblin Bushwhacker alongside pump spells such as Atarka's Command, the deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence and apply pressure to the opponent. The inclusion of mana accelerators like Burning-Tree Emissary and Hidden Herbalists allows for explosive starts, while Lightning Bolt provides removal and reach to close out games. The deck's fast-paced strategy focuses on pushing damage quickly and efficiently to secure victory."
