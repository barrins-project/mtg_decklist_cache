The deck also utilizes cantrips such as Serum Visions and Mishra's Bauble to dig for key cards and fuel delve creatures. By efficiently managing resources and leveraging its life total, this deck seeks to apply pressure and close out games swiftly."

Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish the opponent for playing spells, while Atarka's Command provides reach and additional damage. The land base is optimized for consistent mana and the ability to fetch the necessary colors for spells."
