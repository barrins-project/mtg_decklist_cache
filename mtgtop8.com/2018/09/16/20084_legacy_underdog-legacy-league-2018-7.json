With a combination of counterspells, card selection, and removal, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while setting up powerful win conditions like Entreat the Angels or Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The inclusion of Search for Azcanta provides additional card selection and filtering, while Counterbalance can help lock opponents out of key spells. Overall, the deck is designed to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a slower, more methodical control strategy."
