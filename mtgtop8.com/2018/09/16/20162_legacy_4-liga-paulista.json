The deck also includes various Goblin lords and removal options to further enhance its aggressive strategy and maintain board control."

By keeping the opponent's threats in check and drawing into powerful win conditions like Entreat the Angels and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, the deck aims to out value and out control the opponent in order to secure a win. The mana base is optimized for consistency and the deck is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different matchups."
