The deck focuses on putting pressure on the opponent early in the game by playing powerful threats like Goblin Chainwhirler and Rekindling Phoenix. The inclusion of cards like Ahn-Crop Crasher and Chandra, Torch of Defiance helps maintain pressure on the opponent, while burn spells like Lightning Strike and Abrade provide reach and removal. The deck aims to close out the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
