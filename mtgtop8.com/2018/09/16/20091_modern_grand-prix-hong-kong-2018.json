The deck also includes ways to find its key lands and threats efficiently, such as Sylvan Scrying and Ancient Stirrings. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can deploy its powerful threats to overpower the opponent."

Lightning Helix and Lightning Bolt provide additional removal and reach, while Snapcaster Mage offers flexibility and recursion. The manabase is carefully constructed to support the triple-color requirements of the cards in the deck."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on controlling the game through counterspells, removal spells, and card advantage provided by cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Search for Azcanta, and Snapcaster Mage. The mana base is designed to support the three-color casting requirements of the control spells, with a mix of fetch lands and shock lands. The win condition often comes from using Celestial Colonnade as a creature to finish off the opponent, while using board wipes like Supreme Verdict and Settle the Wreckage to keep the opponent's threats in check."
