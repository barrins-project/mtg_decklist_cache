The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember to deal with threats on the board, as well as planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to control the battlefield. Additionally, cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Smallpox help to keep the opponent's creatures at bay, while Shrieking Affliction adds a clock to pressure the opponent. The deck aims to grind out the opponent's resources and win through attrition."
