This combo is achieved by using cards like Demonic Dread and Violent Outburst to Cascade into Living End. The deck also includes creatures with cycling, like Horror of the Broken Lands and Street Wraith, to fill up the graveyard and provide additional synergy with Living End. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Beast Within and Fulminator Mage to disrupt the opponent's game plan."
