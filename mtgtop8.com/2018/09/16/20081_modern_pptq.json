The deck aims to apply early pressure with Young Pyromancer and Lingering Souls tokens, backed up by efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt, Fatal Push, and Terminate. Blood Moon is included to disrupt opponent's mana bases, and Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and card advantage. Overall, the deck focuses on aggressive plays while disrupting the opponent's strategy."
