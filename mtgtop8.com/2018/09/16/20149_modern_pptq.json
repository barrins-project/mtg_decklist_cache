Drogskol Captain boosts the power of the team and cards like Collected Company provide additional creature tutoring and card advantage. The deck seeks to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out the game quickly with a flurry of Spirit creatures."

By disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Merfolk Trickster and Harbinger of the Tides, and controlling the board with Spreading Seas, this aggro deck aims to quickly establish dominance and close out the game before the opponent can respond effectively. The Aether Vial provides flexibility and speed in deploying threats, while cards like Spell Pierce offer protection against removal and disruption."
