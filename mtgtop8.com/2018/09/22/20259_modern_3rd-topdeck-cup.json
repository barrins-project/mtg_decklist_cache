The deck focuses on pumping up these infect creatures with various spells such as Become Immense, Groundswell, and Might of Old Krosa to deal damage efficiently. Additionally, protection spells like Blossoming Defense and Vines of Vastwood help to ensure that the infect creatures can connect with the opponent. This deck aims to win the game through infect damage rather than traditional life loss."
