The deck focuses on controlling the board with cards like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus while searching for key pieces with Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying. The end goal is to overwhelm the opponent with high-impact threats and powerful planeswalkers, ultimately leading to victory through card advantage and superior board presence."
