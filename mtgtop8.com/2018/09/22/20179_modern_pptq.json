The deck aims to lock the opponent out of the game with cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Witchbane Orb, while also disrupting their game plan with discard spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek. Additionally, the deck can tutor for specific cards with Whir of Invention and utilize graveyard hate with cards like Grafdigger's Cage and Surgical Extraction to further disrupt the opponent's strategy."
