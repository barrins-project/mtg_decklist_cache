Cards like Blood Moon and Lightning Bolt add disruption and removal, while Ancient Stirrings helps find key Eldrazi pieces. The inclusion of Kessig Wolf Run provides additional reach and finisher potential to close out games."

The mana base is optimized to support this strategy and ensure consistent performance."
