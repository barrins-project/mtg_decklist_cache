            "notes": "The key strategy of this UR Aggro Modern deck is to quickly deploy spells and creatures to deal damage to the opponent while disrupting their game plan with counterspells and removal. By playing efficient creatures like Delver of Secrets and Soul-Scar Mage, as well as versatile spells like Lightning Bolt and Wizard's Lightning, the deck aims to apply pressure early and control the board, ultimately overwhelming the opponent before they can set up their own game plan. The deck's reliance on cheap spells and flying creatures allows it to win games quickly and efficiently."
