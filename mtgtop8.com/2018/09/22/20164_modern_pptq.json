Once the graveyard is filled, the deck aims to abuse the Bridge from Below by sacrificing creatures and generating Zombie tokens, while also utilizing cards like Goblin Bushwhacker and Greater Gargadon to set up a lethal attack. The deck can also use Walking Ballista and Endless One as alternate win conditions, providing flexibility in its game plan. Overall, the key idea is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful graveyard-based strategy."

By utilizing cards like Young Pyromancer and Lingering Souls to create a board presence, along with hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's game plan, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game. The addition of cards like Faithless Looting for card selection and Bedlam Reveler for card draw helps to ensure that the deck has enough resources to keep the pressure on the opponent."
