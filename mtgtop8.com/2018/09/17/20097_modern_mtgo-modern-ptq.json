It uses various artifacts and mana producers to loop through the deck, generate value, and overwhelm the opponent with infinite combos. The deck thrives on finding its combo pieces quickly using cards like Mishra's Bauble and Ancient Stirrings, while also having interaction and protection with Engineered Explosives and Sai, Master Thopterist. It aims to win the game in a single explosive turn."

The deck utilizes cards like Primeval Titan, Farseek, and Wood Elves to accelerate land drops and ensure the combo can be executed as quickly as possible. The inclusion of Lightning Bolt and other removal spells helps control the game until the combo can be executed."
