The key strategy is to play out large Eldrazi creatures such as Endbringer, Thought-Knot Seer, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger as quickly as possible to overwhelm the opponent with their powerful abilities and high stats. Cards like Karn, Scion of Urza and Sorcerous Spyglass provide additional utility and disruption, while Chalice of the Void helps control the opponent's spells. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board dominance with its massive creatures."

The deck also aims to generate card advantage through cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and close out the game with powerful threats like Gurmag Angler and Baleful Strix. Additionally, the deck utilizes a mix of dual lands and fetch lands to ensure consistent mana production."
