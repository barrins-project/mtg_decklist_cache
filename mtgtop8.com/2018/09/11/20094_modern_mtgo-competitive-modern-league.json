The deck utilizes the Dredge mechanic to exploit graveyard interactions and create explosive turns that overwhelm the opponent. By combining synergies like Bridge from Below and Greater Gargadon, as well as utilizing cards like Walking Ballista and Goblin Bushwhacker for additional damage, this deck aims to create a lethal combo that can win the game quickly."

The deck also has a toolbox approach, with cards like Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas and Whir of Invention allowing the player to search for specific answers or win conditions. The mana base is designed to support the deck's artifact-heavy strategy and ensure consistent access to the necessary colors of mana."

By efficiently using cards like Lava Spike, Searing Blaze, and Lightning Bolt, along with the potential for double damage from Boros Charm and Skullcrack, this deck aims to close out the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The mana base is optimized for consistent access to the necessary colors for quick and powerful plays."
