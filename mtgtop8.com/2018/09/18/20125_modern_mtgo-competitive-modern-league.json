It aims to apply constant pressure through early creature threats like Tarmogoyf and Bloodbraid Elf while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with discard spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the deck seeks to maintain a fast and aggressive tempo while controlling the board with a mix of creature and spell options."
