By utilizing cards like Mystical Teachings to tutor for specific answers and Pristine Talisman for incremental lifegain and mana ramp, this Dimir Control deck seeks to maintain control of the game until it can close out with a finisher like Evincar's Justice."

By using cards like Counterspell, Tragic Slip, and Chainer's Edict, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while simultaneously drawing cards with Mulldrifter and Forbidden Alchemy. The win condition of the deck is to eventually overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats like Gurmag Angler and Augur of Bolas. The deck thrives on resource management and disruption to outmaneuver the opponent and secure victory."
