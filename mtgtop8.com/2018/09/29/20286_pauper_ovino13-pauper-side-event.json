The key strategy is to stall the game using cheap interaction like Moment's Peace and Stonehorn Dignitary, while establishing card advantage with Mulldrifter and Compulsive Research. The deck also gains incremental life with God-Pharaoh's Faithful and can recur key spells with Archaeomancer/Mnemonic Wall. The mana base is built around bounce lands to ensure consistency and maximize value from Sunscape Familiar."
