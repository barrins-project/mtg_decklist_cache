With this mana, the deck can play powerful colorless threats such as Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, Karn Liberated, Wurmcoil Engine, and Walking Ballista. Additionally, the deck includes ways to search for the UrzaTron lands (Expedition Map, Sylvan Scrying), as well as disruption and graveyard hate (Ghost Quarter, Relic of Progenitus). The deck aims to control the game by playing big threats and disrupting the opponent's game plan."
