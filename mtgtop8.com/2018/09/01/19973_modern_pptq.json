The deck aims to ramp up quickly with Mox Opal and Mind Stone, while also using Ancient Stirrings to find key combo pieces. The deck is versatile with Inventors' Fair for tutoring and Darksteel Citadel for additional resilience."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly building a board presence with aggressive Human creatures to overwhelm the opponent. By utilizing cards like Champion of the Parish and Thalia's Lieutenant, the deck aims to beef up its creatures and take advantage of synergies within the Human tribe. Aether Vial allows for creatures to be played at instant speed, while disruptive creatures like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck's mana base is optimized for casting Human creatures efficiently, ensuring a fast and formidable aggro strategy."
