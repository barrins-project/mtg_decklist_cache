It includes a combination of land destruction, graveyard recursion, and utility lands to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect its own win condition. With cards like Life from the Loam, Wasteland, and Dark Depths, the deck can both deny its opponent resources and quickly assemble a powerful combo to close out the game. The goal is to outlast the opponent and grind them down with incremental advantages from its land-based strategy."
