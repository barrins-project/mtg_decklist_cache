The deck includes a variety of efficient counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce, along with versatile removal spells like Swords to Plowshares. Card selection and manipulation with cards like Brainstorm and Ponder help to find answers and maintain card advantage. The deck also includes win conditions like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Council's Judgment to close out the game once the opponent is sufficiently controlled."

By using lands like Eye of Ugin and Eldrazi Temple to cheat out big threats early, combined with disruptive spells like Chalice of the Void and Dismember, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining a strong offensive presence. Cards like Reality Smasher and Endbringer provide powerful threats that are difficult for opponents to deal with, while Wasteland helps to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the deck focuses on early aggression and disruption to take control of the game."

The key strategy revolves around using counter spells like Daze, Force of Will, and Spell Pierce to disrupt the opponent's plans. Additionally, the deck utilizes powerful removal spells like Swords to Plowshares to deal with problematic creatures. The inclusion of Stoneforge Mystic and equipment like Batterskull and Umezawa's Jitte adds flexibility and resilience to the deck. Delver of Secrets and True-Name Nemesis provide additional threats that can quickly close out the game."
