The key concept involves deploying powerful threats like Hollow One, Bloodghast, and Flameblade Adept early on to apply pressure to the opponent. By filling the graveyard quickly with cards like Street Wraith, Gurmag Angler, and Faithless Looting, the deck can rapidly deploy threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of cards like Burning Inquiry and Collective Brutality adds additional versatility and disruption to keep the opponent on the back foot while pushing for a quick victory."
