            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, efficient creatures and pump spells to quickly deal damage and pressure them into making defensive moves. The deck aims to play aggressively and maintain a high level of pressure throughout the match, utilizing powerful green creatures like Steel Leaf Champion and Avatar of the Resolute, supported by pump spells like Aspect of Hydra and Rancor. The inclusion of cards like Scavenging Ooze and Dismember allows for some disruption and flexibility in dealing with opposing threats, while maintaining a streamlined aggressive game plan."
