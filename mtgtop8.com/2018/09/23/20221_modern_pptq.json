The deck aims to protect its creatures using spells like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense while also ensuring they get through unblocked using cards like Distortion Strike.Overall, the goal is to win the game in a very aggressive manner before the opponent can mount a defense."

The deck focuses on controlling the game through removal spells like Oblivion Stone and counterspells, while using cards like Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying to find key pieces. The deck aims to outvalue opponents with its high impact threats and mana advantage, ultimately overwhelming them with its powerful late-game plays."

            "notes": "The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by taxing their resources with cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Leonin Arbiter while also utilizing creatures like Tidehollow Sculler and Thought-Knot Seer to control their hand. The deck also includes Eldrazi creatures like Eldrazi Displacer and Wasteland Strangler for additional disruption and board control. Aether Vial is used to cheat creatures into play and keep up pressure on the opponent. The overall strategy is to apply early pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan to secure victory."
