            "notes": "The focus of this deck is to quickly fill up the graveyard with powerful creatures like Iona, Griselbrand, and Massacre Wurm using cards like Entomb and Thoughtseize. The deck then uses reanimation spells like Reanimate and Animate Dead to bring these creatures back onto the battlefield, often bypassing their casting costs. This allows the deck to quickly overwhelm the opponent with high-impact creatures while disrupting their hand with cards like Hymn to Tourach and Duress, making it difficult for them to mount a defense."
