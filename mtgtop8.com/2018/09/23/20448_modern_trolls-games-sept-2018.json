The deck runs a variety of cantrips and control spells to dig for the combo pieces, protect the combo once assembled, and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Lingering Souls provides additional blockers and a win condition, while Path to Exile and Lightning Bolt offer removal and interaction. The goal is to quickly set up the combo and overwhelm the opponent with card advantage and tempo."
