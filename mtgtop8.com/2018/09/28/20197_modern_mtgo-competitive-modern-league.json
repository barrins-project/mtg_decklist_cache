The key strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent while preventing them from gaining life or stabilizing the board. With a mix of burn spells, efficient creatures, and disruptive spells, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can establish their game plan. It prioritizes speed and efficiency, aiming to close out the game as quickly as possible."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive spirits that have synergistic abilities. The deck focuses on utilizing creatures with abilities that support each other, such as Drogskol Captain boosting other spirits and Spell Queller disrupting the opponent's spells. The deck also includes ways to protect and support its creatures, such as Selfless Spirit and Remorseful Cleric. The goal is to quickly build a strong board presence and apply pressure on the opponent while disrupting their game plan with counterspells and removal."
