Snapcaster Mage and Thought Scour provide additional card advantage and flexibility, while cards like Gurmag Angler and Tasigur, the Golden Fang offer alternative threats. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to control the board and close out games with Temur Battle Rage."

This allows the player to efficiently cast and copy spells with Pyromancer Ascension, eventually leading to a lethal Grapeshot or Empty the Warrens to finish off the opponent. Gifts Ungiven is used to search for specific combo pieces and Past in Flames provides the ability to recur spells from the graveyard for additional storm count. Overall, the deck aims to assemble its combo pieces quickly and overwhelm the opponent with a high storm count."
