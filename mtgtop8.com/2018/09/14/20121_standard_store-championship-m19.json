Teferi, Hero of Dominaria serves as a key card for card advantage and disrupting the opponent's strategy. Field of Ruin is included to deal with troublesome lands, while Settle the Wreckage and Fumigate provide board wipes for creature-heavy decks. Overall, the strategy is to stay alive long enough to establish dominance and win through incremental advantage."
