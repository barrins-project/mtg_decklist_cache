By ramping with Noble Hierarch and using Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play, the deck can quickly overwhelm the opponent with flying creatures like Supreme Phantom and Spell Queller. Collected Company allows for digging deeper into the deck for more spirits, while cards like Selfless Spirit and Drogskol Captain provide protection and buffs to the team. The goal is to outpace the opponent with a fast and efficient aggro strategy centered around spirit creatures."

Bedlam Reveler allows for card advantage and Hazoret the Fervent provides a strong finisher. The deck also includes removal spells like Terminate and Kolaghan's Command to control the board. With a manabase that supports both black and red mana sources, along with the potential disruption of Blood Moon, this deck aims to apply constant pressure and outvalue opponents."
