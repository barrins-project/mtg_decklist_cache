            "notes": "This Modern 1 vs 1 UW Control deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy through removal spells, counterspells, and card advantage. The key strategy is to control the game by using cards like Path to Exile, Cryptic Command, and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria to answer threats while generating value through card draw and planeswalker abilities. The deck aims to stabilize the board with sweepers like Terminus and Supreme Verdict, while using Celestial Colonnade and planeswalkers to close out the game. The goal is to outlast the opponent and win through incremental advantage."
