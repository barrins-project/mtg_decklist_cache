The deck also includes ways to search for key pieces like Summoner's Pact and Ancient Stirrings, as well as utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Bojuka Bog. By assembling the right combination of cards, you can create explosive turns and overwhelm your opponent with powerful creatures and combo plays."
