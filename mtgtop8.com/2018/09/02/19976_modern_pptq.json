The key strategy is to use cards like Cranial Plating and Galvanic Blast to increase the power of your creatures and deal significant damage to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like Steel Overseer and Arcbound Ravager allows for further synergies and ways to boost your creatures' abilities. Overall, the deck aims to maintain a fast pace and pressure the opponent early on to secure a victory."

The deck utilizes efficient artifact mana sources like Mind Stone and Terrarion, as well as utility lands like Inventors' Fair and Buried Ruin to ensure consistency and resilience to disruption. Ultimately, the goal is to assemble the combo pieces and generate infinite mana to win the game."

The goal is to quickly apply pressure with efficient creatures like Tarmogoyf and Bloodbraid Elf, supported by cards that generate incremental advantage like Dark Confidant and Tireless Tracker. The deck also utilizes strong planeswalker threats in the form of Liliana of the Veil and versatile spells like Kolaghan's Command to outvalue opponents and close out games efficiently."
