Using mana dorks and land-based ramp, it quickly develops a strong board presence with threats like Knight of the Reliquary and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben. It also includes tools like Mother of Runes and Sword of Fire and Ice to protect and enhance its creatures, ensuring a consistent and aggressive game plan. The deck aims to outpace and overwhelm opponents with a proactive strategy that capitalizes on creature synergies and resource denial."
