Once Valakut is in play, you can then use Scapeshift to sacrifice lands and deal massive amounts of damage to your opponent by triggering Valakut multiple times. The deck focuses on setting up this combo efficiently while also having removal options like Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods to control the board."

The goal is to control the board through removal spells like Lightning Bolt and dominate the late game with powerful threats like Inferno Titan and Stormbreath Dragon. The deck also has card advantage engines like Courser of Kruphix and Tireless Tracker to ensure a steady stream of resources."
