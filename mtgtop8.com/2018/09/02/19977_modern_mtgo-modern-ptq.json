By quickly assembling the right cards, including Angel's Grace and Ad Nauseam, the deck can essentially draw its entire library and win the game with either Laboratory Maniac or Lightning Storm. The deck is designed to quickly and efficiently combo off before the opponent has a chance to disrupt the plan, making it a high-risk, high-reward archetype in Modern 1 vs 1 gameplay."

The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy, deal with threats efficiently, and ultimately win through attrition and a strong late game presence. It utilizes a mix of powerful control cards, such as Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, along with versatile spells like Cryptic Command and Path to Exile to dominate the game and come out on top."
