The deck includes disruptive creatures like Meddling Mage to hinder the opponent's game plan, while also featuring powerful humans with evasion like Mantis Rider. Additional support is provided through Thalia's Lieutenant, who boosts the entire team, and Aether Vial, which allows for flash creatures. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of efficient and disruptive human creatures."
