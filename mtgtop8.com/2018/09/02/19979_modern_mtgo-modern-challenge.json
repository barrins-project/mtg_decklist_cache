It aims to stall the opponent's threats while generating card advantage through cards like Cryptic Command and Think Twice. With strong win conditions like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Celestial Colonnade, the deck can close out the game once it has gained control. The mana base is designed to support the deck's powerful spells and ensure the right colors are available when needed."
