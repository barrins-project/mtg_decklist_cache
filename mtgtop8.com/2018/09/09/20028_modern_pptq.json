By combining pump spells like Might of Old Krosa and Groundswell with protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense, you can surprise your opponent with a lethal attack out of nowhere. The key strategy is to efficiently use your resources to overwhelm your opponent with poison counters before they have a chance to respond."
