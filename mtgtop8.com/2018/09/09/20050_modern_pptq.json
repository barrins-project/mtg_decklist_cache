By sacrificing creatures with Viscera Seer or Greater Gargadon, the deck can swarm the board with tokens and overwhelm the opponent with cards like Walking Ballista and Goblin Bushwhacker. The key strategy involves dredging up key cards and combo pieces while exploiting the graveyard to generate a powerful battlefield presence and close out the game quickly."

The deck focuses on controlling the battlefield with cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, and counterspells like Cryptic Command and Logic Knot. Removal spells like Path to Exile and board wipes like Supreme Verdict and Terminus help deal with threats. The deck also includes versatile creatures like Snapcaster Mage and Vendilion Clique for additional disruption and pressure. The mana base is designed for consistency and to support the deck's control strategy."
