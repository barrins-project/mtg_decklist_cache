These creatures are then supported by powerful counterspells like Essence Scatter and Wizard's Retort to protect them from removal spells. Curious Obsession and Chart a Course provide card advantage to maintain pressure on the opponent, while Nimble Obstructionist and Baral, Chief of Compliance offer additional utility. The goal is to apply consistent pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining a strong defense."

The goal is to apply constant pressure on the opponent, forcing them to react to your threats or risk falling behind. By utilizing efficient creatures like Goblin Chainwhirler and powerful planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize. With a mix of burn spells and resilient threats, this deck is designed to maintain tempo and seize victory in the early turns of the game."
