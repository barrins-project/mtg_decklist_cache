The deck aims to force the opponent to discard cards, sacrifice creatures, and ultimately be left unable to mount a threat. The win condition is through incremental damage using cards like The Rack and Shrieking Affliction, while also using cards like Ensnaring Bridge to prevent the opponent from attacking. Liliana of the Veil and Jace, Vryn's Prodigy provide additional disruption and card advantage. The deck has a strong control aspect with a focus on resource denial."

The deck also utilizes modular mechanics with cards like Animation Module and Throne of Geth to further manipulate counters and take advantage of the synergies created by the Hardened Scales enchantment."

The goal is to then win the game either by using Lightning Storm or by playing Laboratory Maniac with zero cards in your library. The deck also includes various cantrips and mana acceleration to help find the combo pieces quickly and efficiently. The key concept is to assemble the combo pieces and execute the win condition as quickly as possible."
