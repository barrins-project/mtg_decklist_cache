Use Mishra's Bauble and Serum Visions to manipulate your draws and maintain card advantage. Close out the game quickly with Temur Battle Rage and efficient removal spells like Dismember and Fatal Push."

Control elements such as Cryptic Command and Jace, the Mind Sculptor are included to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Anger of the Gods to deal with threats."
