The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a flurry of cheap creatures and combo off before they can respond effectively. Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith are key components in maintaining card advantage and consistency in executing the combo, while Gaea's Cradle serves as a powerful mana engine to fuel the deck's explosive plays."
