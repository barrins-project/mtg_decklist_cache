The strategy is to stall the game with defensive creatures like God-Pharaoh's Faithful and Sunscape Familiar until gaining enough advantage to overwhelm the opponent with a large board presence. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent by recycling powerful enters-the-battlefield effects and maintaining a strong defensive position."
