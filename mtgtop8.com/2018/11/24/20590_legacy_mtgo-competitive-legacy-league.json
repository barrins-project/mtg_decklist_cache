By utilizing cards like Faithless Looting and Cabal Therapy to manipulate the graveyard and disrupt the opponent's strategy, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of recurring zombie tokens and recursive creatures like Ichorid. Ultimately, the key strategy is to combo off by exploiting the graveyard synergies to outpace and overpower the opponent in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."
