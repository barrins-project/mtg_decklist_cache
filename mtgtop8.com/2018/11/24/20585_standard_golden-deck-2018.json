Tempest Djinn serves as a powerful finisher in the late game, while cards like Merfolk Trickster and Siren Stormtamer disrupt the opponent's strategy. Overall, the deck prioritizes aggression and adaptability to secure victories in a 1 vs 1 format."

By playing efficient creatures like Soul-Scar Mage, Rekindling Phoenix, and Hazoret the Fervent, along with powerful removal spells like Shock, Lightning Strike, and Abrade, this deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of Goblin Chainwhirler and Earthshaker Khenra provides additional board presence and threat potential, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. The goal is to maintain pressure on the opponent while closing out the game before they have a chance to recover."
