The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize consistency. Overall, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."

The deck also includes powerful creatures like Snapcaster Mage and Delver of Secrets to apply pressure consistently. The inclusion of counterspells like Remand and Spell Snare helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect your own threats. With a mix of burn, tempo plays, and evasive creatures, this deck aims to quickly close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
