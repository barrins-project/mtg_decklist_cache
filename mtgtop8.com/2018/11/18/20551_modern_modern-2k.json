The deck also includes protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing to ensure the creatures can deal damage. The mana base includes fetch lands to ensure consistent mana fixing and Inkmoth Nexus as an alternate win condition. Overall, the deck aims to win quickly through the infect mechanic before the opponent can respond."
