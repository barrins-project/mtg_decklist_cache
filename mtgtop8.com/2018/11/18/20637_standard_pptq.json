By playing aggressive creatures like Adanto Vanguard and Thorn Lieutenant, along with token generators like Emmara and March of the Multitudes, the deck aims to go wide and quickly build a threatening board presence. Cards like Trostani Discordant and Venerated Loxodon provide additional value and buff the team, while removal spells like Conclave Tribunal help clear the way for attacks. The deck focuses on early aggression and maintaining pressure until victory."
