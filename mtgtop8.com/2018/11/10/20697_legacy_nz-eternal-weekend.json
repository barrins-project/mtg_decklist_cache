The deck focuses on creating advantage through cards like Innocent Blood, Smallpox, and Hymn to Tourach, which force your opponent to sacrifice creatures and discard cards. Additionally, the deck is built to limit your opponent's options by using Wasteland, Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth, and other land destruction effects. The deck also contains powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and various disruptive enchantments to further control the game state."

The deck has a low mana curve, allowing it to consistently cast threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan early on. The mana base is optimized to support the deck's aggressive game plan, with efficient dual lands like Volcanic Island and Tropical Island to ensure consistent color fixing."
