The deck aims to establish early board presence with Mausoleum Wanderer and other low-cost Spirits, while controlling the game with countermagic like Spell Queller. Drogskol Captain and Supreme Phantom boost the power of your Spirits, making them difficult to deal with. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and removal spells like Path to Exile. Its mana base is designed to support the Spirit-heavy theme, with utility lands like Moorland Haunt and Mutavault."
