By utilizing the aggressive strategy of attacking early and often with unblockable or hard-to-block creatures, while also maintaining control with counterspells, the deck aims to outpace and overcome the opponent before they have a chance to set up their own game plan. This deck is designed to be fast-paced and efficient, aiming to finish the game quickly through a combination of aggression and disruption."

By using a combination of control elements and versatile spells like Expansion / Explosion, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and outvalue them in the long run. The deck's mana base is carefully crafted to ensure consistent access to all three colors and support its control strategy effectively."

Teferi, Hero of Dominaria provides card advantage, removal, and mana denial, allowing the deck to grind out the opponent over the course of the game. The deck aims to stabilize the board and then win through incremental advantage, eventually closing out the game with Banefire or Expansion / Explosion."
