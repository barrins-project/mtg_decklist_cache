The deck aims to slow down the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage through cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Chemister's Insight. The win condition of the deck is to establish board control and eventually close out the game with powerful finishers like Niv-Mizzet, Parun and Crackling Drake. The deck focuses on efficient removal and resource management to outlast the opponent."
