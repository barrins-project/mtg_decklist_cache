It then looks to control the board with cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Anger of the Gods while using powerful planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Hazoret the Fervent to apply pressure and close out the game. The inclusion of fast mana sources like Simian Spirit Guide and Desperate Ritual allows for explosive starts and quick access to powerful threats."

This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a steady stream of creatures while also burning them out with Conflagrate. The key is to efficiently fill up the graveyard and chain together these graveyard interactions for a powerful and explosive combo finish."
