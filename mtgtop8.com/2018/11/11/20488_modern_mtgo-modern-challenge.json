This deck aims to control the pace of the game by maintaining a fast and relentless tempo, utilizing cards like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Guide, and Lightning Bolt to apply pressure and finish off opponents. Additionally, cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze help to punish opponents for playing spells and creatures, making it difficult for them to mount a comeback."
