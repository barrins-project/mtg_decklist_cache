It features aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Guide, and Eidolon of the Great Revel to deal damage quickly. It also includes a variety of burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Searing Blaze, and Price of Progress to control the board and finish off opponents. The deck aims to apply consistent pressure and finish the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Additionally, cards like Sulfuric Vortex and Pyrostatic Pillar help prevent opponents from gaining life or casting spells efficiently."
