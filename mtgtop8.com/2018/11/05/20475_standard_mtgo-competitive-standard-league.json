Tocatli Honor Guard shuts down enter-the-battlefield effects, while Rekindling Phoenix and Resplendent Angel provide strong threats that are difficult to deal with. Lyra Dawnbringer and Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice give additional power to your creatures, making them even more threatening. Adanto Vanguard provides a resilient attacker, and History of Benalia creates additional creatures to overwhelm your opponent. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to apply early pressure and maintain board control to secure a quick victory."
