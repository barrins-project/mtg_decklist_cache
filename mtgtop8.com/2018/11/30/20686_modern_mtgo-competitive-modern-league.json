Gifts Ungiven allows the player to search for key combo pieces, while cards like Past in Flames and Grapeshot provide win conditions. The deck also includes Goblin Electromancer and Baral, Chief of Compliance to reduce spell costs. The mana base consists of lands that can produce both blue and red mana."
