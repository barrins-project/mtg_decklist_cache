The goal is to set up a powerful turn where you can cast multiple copies of Grapeshot to deal lethal damage to your opponent. Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer help reduce the cost of your spells, while gifts Ungiven allows you to search your deck for key combo pieces. The overall strategy is to cycle through your deck quickly to assemble the pieces needed for a game-winning storm turn."

The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with cards like Sakura-Tribe Elder and Search for Tomorrow, while also utilizing cards like Cryptic Command to protect itself. Once enough lands are on the battlefield, the player can use Scapeshift to sacrifice their lands and fetch Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle to deal lethal damage to the opponent. The key strategy is to stall the game until the combo can be assembled for a game-winning play."
