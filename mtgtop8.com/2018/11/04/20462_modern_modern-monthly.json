By recurring these creatures from the graveyard and using cards like Life from the Loam to bring back lands, the deck can create explosive plays and overwhelming board presence. This allows the player to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a flood of creatures and burn spells, ultimately leading to a quick victory through a powerful graveyard recursion combo."
