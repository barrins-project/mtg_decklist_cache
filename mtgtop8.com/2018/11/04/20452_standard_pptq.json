This allows the player to continuously take extra turns, drawing additional cards and setting up a dominating board presence to eventually overwhelm the opponent."

By constantly applying pressure and dealing direct damage to the opponent's creatures and life total, this deck aims to finish the game as quickly as possible. The inclusion of cards like Experimental Frenzy and Rekindling Phoenix provides additional staying power and ways to close out the game if the initial rush of aggression does not succeed. With a focus on speed and direct damage, this deck is designed to punish slower, less aggressive opponents."
