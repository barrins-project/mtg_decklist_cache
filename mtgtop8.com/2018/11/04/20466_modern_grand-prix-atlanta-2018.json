The land base is designed to support the control game plan with utility lands like Field of Ruin and Creeping Tar Pit, while also providing consistent mana sources.

The win condition usually comes from using Celestial Colonnade as a threat while controlling the board and outvaluing the opponent."

The deck also utilizes powerful removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Terminate to control the board, and uses cards like Faithless Looting to filter through the deck and utilize graveyard synergies, such as bringing back Arclight Phoenix. Overall, this deck is designed to apply early pressure and maintain control throughout the game."
