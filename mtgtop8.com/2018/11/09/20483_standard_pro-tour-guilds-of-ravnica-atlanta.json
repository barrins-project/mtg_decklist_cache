By combining strong early-game creatures like Adanto Vanguard and Skymarcher Aspirant with powerful pumps like Benalish Marshal and History of Benalia, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence and deal damage quickly. Cards like Heroic Reinforcements provide a burst of damage, while Conclave Tribunal helps to control the opponent's threats. With efficient mana base and a focus on aggression, this deck aims to win the game before the opponent can fully set up their game plan."

The deck also includes support cards like Conclave Tribunal and Pride of Conquerors to control the board and give the creatures additional buffs.
