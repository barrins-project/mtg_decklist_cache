By using cards like Wildgrowth Walker to gain life and Jadelight Ranger to sculpt the top of the deck, the deck aims to maintain board presence and card advantage. Carnage Tyrant provides a powerful finisher that is difficult to deal with, while Vivien Reid and Vraska, Golgari Queen offer card advantage and removal options. The deck also includes some recursion with Golgari Findbroker and tempo plays with Find / Finality."
