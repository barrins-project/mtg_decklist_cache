The deck also features powerful planeswalkers like Vivien Reid and Vraska, Golgari Queen to provide additional value and ways to close out the game. The graveyard recursion of Golgari Findbroker and Memorial to Folly ensure that the deck can maintain a steady stream of threats throughout the game."
