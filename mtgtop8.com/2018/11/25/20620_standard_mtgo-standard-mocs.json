The deck also utilizes powerful  finishers like Doom Whisperer, Carnage Tyrant, and Vivien Reid to push for a quick victory.

Cards like Find / Finality and Memorial to Folly provide recursion and card advantage, and powerful creatures like Carnage Tyrant and Doom Whisperer help to close out the game. Vivien Reid and Karn, Scion of Urza provide additional card advantage and versatile abilities to support the game plan. Overall, this deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain tempo to secure victory."
