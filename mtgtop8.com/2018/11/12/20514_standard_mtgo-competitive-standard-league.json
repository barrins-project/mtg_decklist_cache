The deck also includes cards like March of the Multitudes and Trostani Discordant to generate tokens and gain life. The Immortal Sun is included to provide card draw and mana acceleration. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures and outvalue them in the mid to late game."
