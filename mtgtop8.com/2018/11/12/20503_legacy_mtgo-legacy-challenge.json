Knight of the Reliquary and Scavenging Ooze provide utility and resilience, while utilizing lands like Wasteland and Ghost Quarter to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the deck aims to grind out advantage and outvalue the opponent through careful resource management and disruption."

The deck uses a mix of aggressive creatures and disruptive spells to apply pressure and maintain tempo advantage over opponents in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches. The mana denial from Wasteland also helps disrupt opponents' plans and slow down their development while the deck aims to close out games swiftly with its aggressive threats."

The deck utilizes cards like Dark Ritual, Cabal Ritual, and Lion's Eye Diamond to generate mana quickly, while also including card draw and discard spells to sculpt the perfect hand. The goal is to efficiently chain together spells and generate a large storm count, allowing for a devastating finish that overwhelms the opponent."
