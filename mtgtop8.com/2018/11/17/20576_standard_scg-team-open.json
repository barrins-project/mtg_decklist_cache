The deck focuses on playing efficient creatures like Adanto Vanguard and Rekindling Phoenix, while also utilizing cards like Resplendent Angel and Lyra Dawnbringer to gain a huge advantage in combat. Tocatli Honor Guard helps against creature-based decks, while removal spells like Lava Coil and Ixalan's Binding provide necessary interaction. History of Benalia further boosts the aggression of the deck, aiming to close out games quickly with a strong board presence."
