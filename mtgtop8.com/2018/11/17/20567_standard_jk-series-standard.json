By using cards like Legion's Landing, Adanto Vanguard, and Benalish Marshal, the deck aims to go wide and apply pressure early in the game. Support cards such as History of Benalia and Ajani, Adversary of Tyrants help to buff and protect the creatures, while cards like Conclave Tribunal provide removal options. The deck also has options for card advantage and combat trick plays with Flower / Flourish and Assure / Assemble. The mana base is designed to support the deck's aggressive game plan."
