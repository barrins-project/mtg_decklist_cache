By using efficient mana accelerators like Llanowar Elves and Greenbelt Rampager, the deck aims to quickly deploy threats like Steel Leaf Champion and Rhonas the Indomitable. Other key cards like Ghalta, Primal Hunger and Scrapheap Scrounger provide additional threats and recursion options. The inclusion of vehicles like Heart of Kiran and Skysovereign, Consul Flagship adds versatility and evasion to the deck. Overall, the strategy revolves around aggressive play and high creature density to pressure the opponent."

The deck also includes strong finishers like Angel of Sanctions and Lyra Dawnbringer to close out the game. Ajani, Adversary of Tyrants can provide additional support by buffing your creatures.
