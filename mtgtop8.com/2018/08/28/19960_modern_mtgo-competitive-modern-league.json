The key strategy is to play low-cost goblin creatures and use them to deal damage to the opponent directly or through sacrifice effects. The deck also includes burn spells to remove blockers or finish off the opponent. It relies on fast mana acceleration provided by Burning-Tree Emissary and uses haste-granting abilities to create explosive turns. The deck aims to win the game in the early turns by overwhelming the opponent's defenses and dealing enough damage to secure victory."
