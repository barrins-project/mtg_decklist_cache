It utilizes cards like Merfolk Branchwalker and Jadelight Ranger to dig for key pieces like God-Pharaoh's Gift and Verdurous Gearhulk, which can quickly turn the tide of the game. The inclusion of Gate to the Afterlife helps to accelerate the deck's win condition by getting God-Pharaoh's Gift onto the battlefield faster. The deck aims for a powerful late-game presence with strong creatures and the ability to outvalue the opponent."
