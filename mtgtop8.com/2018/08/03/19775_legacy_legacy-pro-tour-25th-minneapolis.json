This allows the player to cheat out powerful threats ahead of schedule and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to respond. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Cabal Therapy and Thoughtseize to disrupt the opponent's game plan."

The deck also includes mana ramp in the form of Noble Hierarch and cantrips like Ponder and Brainstorm to help dig for combo pieces. Disruption spells like Daze, Force of Will, and Spell Pierce help protect the combo, while Vines of Vastwood provides protection against removal. Overall, the deck focuses on fast and efficient combos to win the game."
