It includes cards that disrupt the opponent's strategy, such as Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter, as well as cards that protect and support the human creatures, like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Thalia's Lieutenant. The Aether Vial allows for creatures to be played at instant speed, making it harder for the opponent to react. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and powerful aggro strategy focused on Human creatures."

This enables the player to cast powerful colorless spells such as Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to control the board and win the game. The deck also includes other threats like Wurmcoil Engine and Walking Ballista, as well as utility cards like Expedition Map and Oblivion Stone to disrupt the opponent's strategy. It is a resilient and versatile control deck that aims to overwhelm the opponent with its powerful late-game threats."
