            "notes": "The deck focuses on generating a large amount of mana by sacrificing artifacts with Krark-Clan Ironworks, then recurs them from the graveyard with Scrap Trawler to create a loop that allows for infinite mana and card draw. This combo can lead to a decisive advantage in the game, overwhelming opponents with resources and eventually winning through a big finisher like Pyrite Spellbomb. The deck also includes cards like Engineered Explosives and Mox Opal to control the board and accelerate its game plan."
