The deck also includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Wasteland to control the game. Cavern of Souls ensures that the Merfolk creatures can't be countered, while Aether Vial offers additional speed and flexibility. The deck's key strength lies in its ability to quickly establish a board presence and apply pressure early in the game, making it difficult for the opponent to respond effectively."
