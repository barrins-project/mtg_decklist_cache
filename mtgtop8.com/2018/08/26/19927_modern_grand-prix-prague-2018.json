The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while developing its own mana base and drawing cards efficiently. With access to a variety of removal spells like Path to Exile and Supreme Verdict, along with versatile counterspells such as Cryptic Command and Logic Knot, the deck can handle a wide range of threats and maintain control of the game until it can win with a threat like Celestial Colonnade or Secure the Wastes."

The deck aims to maintain board control and disrupt the opponent's game plan using cards like Path to Exile, Detention Sphere, and Terminus. It also focuses on card draw and selection with cards like Opt, Serum Visions, and Search for Azcanta. The win conditions in the deck include Celestial Colonnade and planeswalkers such as Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Jace, the Mind Sculptor."
