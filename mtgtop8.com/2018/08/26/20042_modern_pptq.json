By playing aggressive creatures like Drogskol Captain, Geist of Saint Traft, and Spell Queller, the deck aims to establish a fast clock and control the board with cards like Rattlechains and Selfless Spirit. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, while cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Path to Exile help to disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, Supreme Phantom boosts the power of the Spirit creatures, increasing the overall aggro potential of the deck."
