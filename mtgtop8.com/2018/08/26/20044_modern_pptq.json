This mana is then used to play powerful colorless spells like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to control the game and outvalue the opponent. The deck also has access to utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Sanctum of Ugin to deal with threats and search for more threats, making it a versatile and resourceful control deck."
