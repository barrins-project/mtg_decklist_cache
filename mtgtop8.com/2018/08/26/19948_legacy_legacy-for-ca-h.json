The deck also focuses on card selection and manipulation with cards like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Portent to ensure consistent draws and answers. The win condition is typically through incremental advantage with planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor or by creating a proactive threat with cards like Vendilion Clique or Entreat the Angels. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistency and flexibility."
