It utilizes cards like Cryptic Command, Path to Exile, and Terminus to maintain board control, while also utilizing Planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria for card advantage and win conditions. The deck also includes Search for Azcanta for card selection and a flexible win condition in Celestial Colonnade. Overall, the main strategy is to outvalue the opponent and control the game until securing a victory."
