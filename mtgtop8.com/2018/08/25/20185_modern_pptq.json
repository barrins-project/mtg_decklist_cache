Card advantage is generated through cards like Serum Visions and Snapcaster Mage, while powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor provide additional value.

The inclusion of Skullcrack helps to prevent opponents from gaining life or disrupting the deck's aggressive game plan, while cards like Grim Lavamancer and Eidolon of the Great Revel provide additional sources of damage and disruption."
