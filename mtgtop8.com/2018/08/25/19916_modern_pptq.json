The deck also utilizes creatures with disruptive abilities such as Spell Queller and Knight of the Reliquary to control the board while pressuring the opponent. Retreat to Coralhelm provides additional value by untapping creatures and providing card selection. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the deck's color requirements and synergy with cards like Knight of the Reliquary."
