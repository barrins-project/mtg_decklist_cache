By utilizing cards like Goblin Guide, Monastery Swiftspear, and Eidolon of the Great Revel, along with powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Lava Spike, the goal is to reduce the opponent's life total to zero as quickly as possible. The mana base is streamlined to support casting these spells efficiently, ensuring that the deck maintains a fast and aggressive tempo throughout the game."
