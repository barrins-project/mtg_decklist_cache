By utilizing efficient removal spells like Path to Exile and Fatal Push, along with hand disruption cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while deploying threats like Tarmogoyf, Grim Flayer, and Kalitas to end the game in its favor. Additionally, the deck has the ability to grind out games with cards like Liliana of the Veil and Lingering Souls."
