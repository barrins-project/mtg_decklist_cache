            "notes": "The deck focuses on playing Leyline cards for free at the beginning of the game, taking advantage of their powerful effects to control the board state and disrupt the opponent's strategy. By using cards like Crop Rotation and Enlightened Tutor to find key pieces like Opalescence and Helm of Obedience, the deck can quickly assemble a strong combo win condition. The presence of Leyline of Sanctity and other Leyline cards protect the player from targeted effects while pushing forward with their own game plan to achieve victory."
