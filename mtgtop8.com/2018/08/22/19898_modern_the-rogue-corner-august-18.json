It also utilizes cards like Insolent Neonate and Faithless Looting to fill up the graveyard and trigger powerful effects like Bridge from Below. The deck includes combo pieces like Greater Gargadon and Goblin Bushwhacker to further enhance its aggressive strategy. Additionally, cards like Walking Ballista and Hangarback Walker provide flexibility and additional threats. By efficiently utilizing the graveyard and combining aggressive creatures with powerful synergies, this deck aims to quickly close out games."
