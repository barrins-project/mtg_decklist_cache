The deck aims to control the board and stabilize the game with cards like Terminus and Supreme Verdict, while also setting up card advantage engines like Search for Azcanta and Ancestral Vision. The win condition is typically through card advantage and incremental advantage gained over time."

Utilizing cards like Pyretic Ritual, Desperate Ritual, and Baral, Chief of Compliance to generate mana, while cards like Gifts Ungiven and Past in Flames allow for recursion and card advantage. The deck aims to set up explosive turns where it can chain together multiple spells for a lethal Grapeshot or generate a large storm count to overwhelm the opponent."
