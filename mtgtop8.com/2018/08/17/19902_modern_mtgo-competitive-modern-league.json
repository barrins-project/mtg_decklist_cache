By using efficient control spells like Mana Leak and Path to Exile, paired with card draw from Opt and Search for Azcanta, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent. With versatile threats like Celestial Colonnade and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, the deck can quickly close out the game once it has gained control. This archetype excels at slow, methodical gameplay and strategic decision-making."
