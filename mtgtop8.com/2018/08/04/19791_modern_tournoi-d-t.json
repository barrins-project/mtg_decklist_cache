The goal is to lock the opponent out of the game by using Ensnaring Bridge to prevent attacks while manipulating the top of their library with cards like Pyxis of Pandemonium. With the ability to tutor for specific answers with Whir of Invention and Ancient Stirrings, the deck aims to grind out the opponent and control the game until victory is achieved."
