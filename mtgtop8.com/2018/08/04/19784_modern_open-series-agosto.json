The deck aims to stall the game with cards like Thing in the Ice and Snapcaster Mage, then close it out with powerful finishers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Torrential Gearhulk. Blood Moon can disrupt opponent's plans, while Lightning Bolt and Abrade provide additional removal options. Cryptic Command serves as a versatile card that can counter spells, tap creatures, draw cards, or bounce permanents."
