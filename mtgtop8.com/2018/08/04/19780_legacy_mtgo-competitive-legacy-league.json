Additionally, the deck includes win conditions such as Dark Depths and Titania, Protector of Argoth to close out the game quickly once it has established control. This deck relies on synergy between land recursion, removal, and powerful threats to secure victory."

This deck aims to bring back these creatures from the graveyard to overwhelm the opponent and secure a victory through their strong abilities and abilities to control the board. The inclusion of cards like Thoughtseize, Collective Brutality, and Unmask help disrupt the opponent's strategy and protect the combo pieces, while also providing card advantage and potentially dealing with threats on the battlefield."
