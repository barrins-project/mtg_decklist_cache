The inclusion of utility cards like Path to Exile and Selfless Spirit helps to further disrupt opponents' strategies. Overall, this deck excels at applying pressure early and maintaining control throughout the game."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on ramping up mana quickly with Tron lands and Eldrazi Temple to cast powerful Eldrazi creatures ahead of schedule. It disrupts opponents by using Chalice of the Void to lock out low-cost spells and Thought-Knot Seer to strip key cards from their hand. The deck also includes removal spells like Dismember and All Is Dust to deal with threats. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with big, efficient creatures like Reality Smasher and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger while controlling the game with disruption and removal."
