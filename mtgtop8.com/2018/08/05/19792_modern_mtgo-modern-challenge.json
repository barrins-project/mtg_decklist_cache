            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game through the use of disruptive spells like Blood Moon, Ensnaring Bridge, and Chalice of the Void. By locking down the opponent's resources, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence with powerful creatures like Sarkhan, Fireblood, Goblin Rabblemaster, and Avaricious Dragon. Additionally, the deck utilizes burn spells and ramp effects to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out the game quickly. This strategy allows the deck to dictate the pace of the game and outlast opponents in a 1 vs 1 matchup."
