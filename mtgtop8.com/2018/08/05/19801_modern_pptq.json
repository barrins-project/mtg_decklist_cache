The deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent with efficient threats like Young Pyromancer and Bedlam Reveler, backed up by versatile removal like Lightning Bolt and Kolaghan's Command. The mana base is streamlined and efficient, allowing for consistent casting of spells across all three colors. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of disruption, aggression, and card advantage."
