The inclusion of Contamination and Bitterblossom allows for additional resource denial, while cards like Crucible of Worlds and Raven's Crime provide value through recurring land destruction. Overall, the deck looks to grind out opponents by slowly dismantling their resources and controlling the game until victory."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy using Sliver creatures. The deck focuses on creating a powerful board presence quickly by using cards like Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play and benefit from the synergy between various Sliver creatures. With a mix of evasion abilities, protection, and pump effects, this deck aims to apply pressure early in the game and maintain that pressure throughout to secure victory. Additionally, having cards like Force of Will helps to protect the game plan from disruption."
