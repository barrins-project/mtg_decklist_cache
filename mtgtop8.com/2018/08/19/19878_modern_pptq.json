The deck also includes cards like Lightning Bolt and Sweltering Suns for removal and Sakura-Tribe Elder and Explore for ramp and card draw. Overall, the goal is to ramp up to enough lands to activate Valakut and burn the opponent down in one powerful turn."

The deck also includes protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Apostle's Blessing to protect the creatures from removal and ensure a successful infect victory."
