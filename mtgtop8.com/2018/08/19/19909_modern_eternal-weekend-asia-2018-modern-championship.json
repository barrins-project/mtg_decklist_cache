By sacrificing creatures and triggering Bridge from Below, the player can create a large army of creatures and potentially win the game quickly with cards like Goblin Bushwhacker. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive combo strategy centered around graveyard interactions and creature recursion."

It utilizes a variety of color-fixing artifacts to ensure consistent mana production. The deck includes powerful threats like Wurmcoil Engine, Walking Ballista, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to control the board and finish the game. It also features powerful planeswalkers like Karn Liberated and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to provide additional control and win conditions. The deck's main objective is to ramp up quickly and dominate the game with high-impact threats and spells."
