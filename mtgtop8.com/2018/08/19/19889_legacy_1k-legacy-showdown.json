The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Dismember to deal with threats. The mana base of dual lands and fetch lands allows for smooth mana fixing and consistency in casting spells. Overall, the strategy is to pressure the opponent early and close out the game before they can stabilize."
