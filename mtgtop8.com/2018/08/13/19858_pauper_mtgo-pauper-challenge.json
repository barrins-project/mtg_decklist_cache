The deck also includes card draw and protection spells to keep the pressure on and protect your creatures. The mana base includes lands that provide both colors needed for spells and also help with consistency. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy."

By utilizing cheap, efficient creatures like Faerie Miscreant and Delver of Secrets alongside powerful control spells like Counterspell and Spellstutter Sprite, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while consistently applying pressure. With cards like Vapor Snag and Gush providing additional utility and card advantage, this mono blue aggro deck looks to overwhelm opponents with a balance of aggression and disruption."
