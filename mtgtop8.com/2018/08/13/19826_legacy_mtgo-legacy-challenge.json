The deck uses a combination of tutors, rituals, and cantrips to quickly assemble the necessary resources to win the game in a single turn. Thoughtseize and Duress are included to disrupt opponent's strategies while Infernal Tutor and Past in Flames provide additional ways to find and cast key combo pieces. The deck features a streamlined mana base with efficient acceleration in the form of Lotus Petal and Lion's Eye Diamond."

By utilizing cards like Monastery Swiftspear, Delver of Secrets, and Chain Lightning, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of countermagic like Daze and Force of Will provides protection for key threats while also disrupting the opponent's game plan. Additionally, the deck can finish off opponents with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Price of Progress, ultimately aiming to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
