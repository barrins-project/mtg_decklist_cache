The inclusion of interaction and disruption spells like Daze and Stubborn Denial allows the deck to protect its threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also using reanimation spells like Reanimate to efficiently bring back key creatures from the graveyard."

The deck also includes disruption elements such as Thoughtseize, Duress, and Pithing Needle to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Elvish Spirit Guide and Lotus Petal provide additional mana acceleration to help execute the combo faster. Overall, the deck aims to create a powerful, game-winning 20/20 Marit Lage token as quickly as possible to overwhelm the opponent."
