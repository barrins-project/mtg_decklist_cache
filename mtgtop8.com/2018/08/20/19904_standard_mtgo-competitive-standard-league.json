Card advantage is gained through Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Search for Azcanta, allowing the player to outvalue the opponent in the long game. The deck also includes a finisher in Torrential Gearhulk to close out the game once control is firmly established."

With a strong focus on early aggression and board control, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total while maintaining a consistent pace of threats. Utilizing synergies between creatures like Dread Wanderer, Gifted Aetherborn, and Graveyard Marshal, along with removal spells like Fatal Push and Walk the Plank, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Aethersphere Harvester and Scrapheap Scrounger adds versatility and resilience to the deck's game plan."
