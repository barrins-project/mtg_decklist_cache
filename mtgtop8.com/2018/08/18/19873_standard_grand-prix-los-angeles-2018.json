Karn, Scion of Urza and Karn's Temporal Sundering offer additional utility and win conditions, making it a versatile and powerful combo deck that controls the game until it can execute its game-winning combo."

            "notes": "The essence of this UW Control deck lies in its ability to disrupt opponent's strategies and maintain control of the game through counter spells, removal, and board wipes. Teferi, Hero of Dominaria provides card advantage and versatility, while Approach of the Second Sun offers a win condition. Search for Azcanta helps with card selection and filtering, while the rest of the deck focuses on keeping the opponent's threats at bay. With a combination of tempo plays and late-game finishers, this deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a battle of attrition."
