The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by countering or removing their threats while simultaneously building card advantage through cards like Snapcaster Mage, Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and Search for Azcanta. The deck also utilizes powerful board wipes like Supreme Verdict and Terminus to clear the opponent's creatures. The win condition is often through taking control of the game's tempo and overwhelming the opponent with a combination of planeswalkers and large threats like Entreat the Angels."
