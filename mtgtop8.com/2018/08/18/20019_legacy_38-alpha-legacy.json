The deck includes various cantrips and counterspells to help dig for the combo pieces and protect them once they are on the battlefield. Additionally, cards like Cunning Wish and Intuition provide extra utility and flexibility in finding key pieces or answers to specific threats. The strategy revolves around setting up and executing the Show and Tell combo as efficiently as possible."

            "notes": "The focus of this deck is to control the game by disrupting opponent's strategies with counterspells and removal spells while setting up a lock with Energy Field and Rest in Peace. The deck also aims to dig through the library efficiently with cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder, with Search for Azcanta providing additional card selection. The inclusion of Humility and Detention Sphere helps to deal with problematic creatures and permanents, while Helm of Obedience serves as a win condition when paired with Rest in Peace. The mana base is optimized with fetch lands and dual lands to ensure consistency in casting spells."
