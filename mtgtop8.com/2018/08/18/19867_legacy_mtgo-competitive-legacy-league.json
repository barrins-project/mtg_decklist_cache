The deck also includes protection for the combo with cards like Sylvan Safekeeper and Sejiri Steppe. With the right pieces in hand, the deck can quickly create a 20/20 Marit Lage token and overwhelm the opponent before they can respond effectively. The key is to balance finding combo pieces and disrupting the opponent's game plan effectively."
