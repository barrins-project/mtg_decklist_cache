The goal is to apply early pressure with strong creatures like Tarmogoyf and Bloodbraid Elf while disrupting the opponent's game plan with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize. Liliana of the Veil provides additional disruption and removal, while Dark Confidant helps to draw more cards for consistent threats. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly before they can stabilize or answer the threats."
