Aether Vial is used to cheat creatures into play at instant speed, while cards like Reflector Mage and Meddling Mage disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base is optimized for casting Humans efficiently, with Unclaimed Territory and Cavern of Souls providing color fixing. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive creature-based strategy."
