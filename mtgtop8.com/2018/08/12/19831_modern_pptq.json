The deck also utilizes cards like Faithless Looting and Mishra's Bauble to enable graveyard synergies and draw through the deck quickly. With a low life total, Death's Shadow becomes a massive threat that can quickly close out games with cards like Temur Battle Rage. The deck aims to be fast and efficient in its strategy, putting pressure on the opponent from the start."

The deck focuses on setting up the win condition and disrupting the opponent's strategy until the combo can be executed. With a mix of card draw, ramp spells, and versatile removal, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and secure a victory through careful planning and strategic plays."

The deck aims to loop through its artifacts to generate more value and find ways to win the game, potentially by casting multiple spells in one turn or overwhelming the opponent with a large number of threats. The deck also includes cards like Sai, Master Thopterist and Engineered Explosives for added utility and protection."
