The deck also includes Arcbound Ravager for modular counters and Karn, Scion of Urza for additional card advantage. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast and efficient damage output, utilizing the synergy between artifacts and powerful creatures. The manabase includes various lands that support the artifact-heavy deck."
