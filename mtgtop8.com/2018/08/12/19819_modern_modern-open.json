The deck utilizes discard spells like Faithless Looting, Burning Inquiry, and Goblin Lore to draw cards and put cards into the graveyard. This allows the deck to abuse the delve mechanic with cards like Gurmag Angler and Tasigur, the Golden Fang. Lightning Bolt and Collective Brutality provide removal and disruption, while the mana base is optimized for consistent early-game aggression. The strategy revolves around explosive starts and overwhelming the opponent with efficient threats."

By utilizing cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and Search for Azcanta, the deck aims to generate incremental advantage and outvalue the opponent. Cards like Path to Exile and Terminus help to deal with threats on the board, while cards like Cryptic Command and Negate provide disruption for the opponent's game plan. The deck ultimately aims to grind out the opponent and secure victory through superior resources and board control."
