The win condition is usually through planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria or Celestial Colonnade beats. The mana base is optimized for flexibility and consistency, enabling the player to adapt to various matchups and situations."

Liliana of the Veil and Liliana, the Last Hope offer additional control and recursion options.
