The inclusion of cards like Karn, Scion of Urza and The Antiquities War provide additional card advantage and utility to keep the pressure on."

Key cards like Baral and Gifts Ungiven help dig through the deck and find the necessary pieces for the storm combo. The deck aims to efficiently cycle through spells and mana to set up a powerful combo turn and overwhelm the opponent with a barrage of spells and burn damage."
