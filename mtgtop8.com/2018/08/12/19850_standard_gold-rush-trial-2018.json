With a strong mana base and a mix of high-impact threats, the deck is designed to overwhelm opponents quickly while also being able to handle threats and disrupt opposing strategies. The inclusion of powerful midrange threats like Jadelight Ranger and Vraska, Relic Seeker allows the deck to transition into a more control-oriented strategy if needed."
