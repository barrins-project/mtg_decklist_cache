The deck aims to stabilize the board with removal spells like Path to Exile and Supreme Verdict, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Spell Snare and Cryptic Command. The deck also has a strong late-game plan with powerful finishers like Celestial Colonnade and Secure the Wastes. Additionally, it has a solid mana base to support its three-color requirements."
