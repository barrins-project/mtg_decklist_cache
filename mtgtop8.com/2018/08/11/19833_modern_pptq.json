By using Lantern of Insight and Codex Shredder, the player can manipulate the top of their opponent's library, denying them access to key cards. The deck also includes cards like Pyrite Spellbomb and Abrupt Decay for removal and Witchbane Orb for protection. The mana base is designed to support the deck's multicolor requirements while also including utility lands like Academy Ruins and Inventors' Fair."
