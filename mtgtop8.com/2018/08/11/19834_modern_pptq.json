The deck aims to cast Gifts Ungiven to search for combo pieces such as Past in Flames and Grapeshot, allowing for multiple copies of Grapeshot to be cast in one turn to deal lethal damage to the opponent. The deck focuses on chaining spells together efficiently to create a powerful and explosive combo finish."
