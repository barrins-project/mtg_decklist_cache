The deck aims to maintain a fast pace and pressure the opponent early on, while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Skullcrack and Lightning Helix. The strategy is to overload the opponent with direct damage and force them to react defensively, leaving them vulnerable to further attacks. The combination of burn spells and aggressive creatures makes this deck a formidable threat in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."
