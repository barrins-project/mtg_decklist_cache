It aims to stabilize the board with board wipes like Wrath of God and Supreme Verdict, while keeping the opponent's threats in check with cards like Path to Exile and Lightning Bolt. Teferi, Hero of Dominaria provides card draw and allows for additional control options. Search for Azcanta helps filter through the deck for key cards. The win condition comes from generating advantage with Torrential Gearhulk and Celestial Colonnade, while securing the board with Secure the Wastes."
