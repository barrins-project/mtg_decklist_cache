The deck also has a win condition in the form of Celestial Colonnade and Secure the Wastes to close out the game once it has stabilized. The mana base is optimized to support the deck's color requirements and maximize consistency in casting spells."

This mana is used to cast powerful threats like Karn Liberated, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, and Wurmcoil Engine, while also utilizing removal spells like Oblivion Stone and Dismember to control the opponent's board. The deck also includes cards like Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying to consistently find the UrzaTron pieces, ensuring that the deck can quickly establish dominance in the late game."
