The deck aims to control the board with cards like Settle the Wreckage, Path to Exile, and Terminus, while also generating advantage with Snapcaster Mage and Search for Azcanta. The win condition is typically through Celestial Colonnade beats or by casting Entreat the Angels for a large flying army. The mana base is designed to consistently cast spells and activate Field of Ruin for disruption."
