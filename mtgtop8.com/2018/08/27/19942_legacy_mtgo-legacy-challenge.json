This is achieved through powerful mana acceleration cards like Lotus Petal and Lion's Eye Diamond, along with efficient draw and selection spells like Brainstorm, Preordain, and Ponder. With ample disruption in the form of Thoughtseize, Duress, and Infernal Tutor, the deck can protect its combo while disrupting the opponent's game plan. The key is to carefully sequence spells and manage resources to build up to a game-winning storm turn."

The deck aims to control the game through card advantage from Snapcaster Mage and Baleful Strix, while closing out the game with efficient threats like Gurmag Angler. The mana base is optimized for casting a variety of spells and the deck includes countermagic in the form of Force of Will to protect its key spells."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to aggressively control the board and apply pressure to the opponent quickly. By using efficient removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Lightning Bolt, along with disruption from cards like Spell Pierce and Daze, the deck aims to keep the opponent on the back foot while deploying threats like Delver of Secrets, Young Pyromancer, and True-Name Nemesis. The deck's mana base also allows for consistent access to all the necessary colors, ensuring that the aggressive game plan can be executed smoothly."
