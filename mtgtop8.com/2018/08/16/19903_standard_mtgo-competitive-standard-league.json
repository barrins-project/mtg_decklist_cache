The inclusion of cards like Commit / Memory and Thrashing Brontodon provides some flexibility and disruption against opposing strategies, while Heart of Kiran offers additional aggression and evasion."

The key concept is to play efficient early game creatures like Llanowar Elves and Steel Leaf Champion to ramp up mana and apply pressure. Cards like Ghalta, Primal Hunger and Rhonas the Indomitable serve as finishers to close out the game swiftly. The inclusion of cards like Blossoming Defense and Thrashing Brontodon offer protection and disruption against opposing strategies. Overall, the deck aims to establish board dominance and end the game before the opponent can stabilize."
