The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and board control options like Fiery Confluence. By applying pressure with aggressive creatures like Goblin Rabblemaster and Pia and Kiran Nalaar, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and secure a victory through overwhelming board presence."
