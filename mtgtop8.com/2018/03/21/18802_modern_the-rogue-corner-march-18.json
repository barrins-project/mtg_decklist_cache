The deck aims to utilize ramp cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Gemstone Caverns to accelerate into powerful threats like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer. Additionally, the deck includes synergy between cards like Eternal Scourge and Serum Powder to create a resilient and efficient aggro strategy that can quickly close out games."
