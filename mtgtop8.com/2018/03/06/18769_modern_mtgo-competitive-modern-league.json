            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly build up a strong and untargetable creature by attaching powerful auras, while also protecting it with hexproof and protection enchantments. This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a large, evasive creature that can deal consistent damage throughout the game. The key strategy is to use cards like Ethereal Armor, Daybreak Coronet, and Rancor to enhance the creature's stats and abilities, while Leyline of Sanctity provides protection from targeted spells. Additionally, the land base helps to ensure consistent mana access for casting the auras."
