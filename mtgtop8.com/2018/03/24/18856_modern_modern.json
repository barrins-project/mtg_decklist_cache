With a mix of efficient creatures like Goblin Guide and Wild Nacatl, along with explosive plays from Burning-Tree Emissary and Hidden Herbalists, this deck aims to come out swinging early and maintain pressure throughout the game. Lightning Bolt provides additional reach and removal, while Manamorphose helps with fixing mana and boosting the deck's overall speed. By combining speed and aggression, this deck aims to outpace and outmuscle the opponent."
