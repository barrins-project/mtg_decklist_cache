Additionally, cards like Blood Moon can disrupt your opponent's mana base, while cards like Lightning Bolt and Electrolyze provide additional removal options. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and outvalue your opponent through efficient spells and card advantage."

Lingering Souls can provide additional threats and card advantage, while disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek help to control the opponent's hand. The inclusion of Blood Moon can disrupt the opponent's mana base, giving the deck an advantage. Overall, the key strategy is to maintain a fast and aggressive pace while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
