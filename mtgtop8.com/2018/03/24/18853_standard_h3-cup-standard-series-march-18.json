By using cards like Vraska's Contempt, Doomfall, and Magma Spray to remove opposing threats, along with card advantage engines like Glint-Sleeve Siphoner and Glimmer of Genius, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent in the long game. The deck also has powerful finishers like The Scarab God and Torrential Gearhulk to close out the game once it has stabilized. Additionally, the mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's triple color requirements."
