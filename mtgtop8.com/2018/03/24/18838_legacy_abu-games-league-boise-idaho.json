By using cards like Thoughtseize, Hymn to Tourach, and Liliana of the Veil, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's hand and board state while applying pressure with creatures like Dark Confidant and Goblin Rabblemaster. The deck also utilizes efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Abrupt Decay to deal with threats, and Punishing Fire for additional burn damage. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and maximize resource denial with cards like Wasteland."
