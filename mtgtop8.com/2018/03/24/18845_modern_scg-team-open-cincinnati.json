The goal is to set up a combo turn where you can cast multiple spells in one turn, eventually leading to a lethal Grapeshot or Past in Flames to finish off your opponent. Cards like Gifts Ungiven and Noxious Revival help you search for key pieces of the combo, while cards like Remand and Sleight of Hand help you dig deeper into your deck."

By using a combination of hand disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push, and efficient threats like Tarmogoyf and Dark Confidant, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and outvalue the opponent. The inclusion of powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and versatile cards like Kolaghan's Command allows for flexibility in different matchups, making the deck a versatile and formidable opponent in the Modern format."
