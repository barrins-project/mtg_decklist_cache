Additionally, the deck includes burn spells like Ramunap Ruins and Hazoret the Fervent to close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."

The deck also includes control elements such as Condescend, Remand, and Repeal to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, it includes utility cards like Academy Ruins and Field of Ruin to recycle resources and disrupt the opponent's lands.

The deck also includes some control elements with counterspells like Remand and removal like Harnessed Lightning. Other cards like Whirler Virtuoso and Rogue Refiner provide additional energy and card advantage."

            "notes": "The main focus of this UR Aggro deck is to maintain control through disruptive counterspells and removal while aggressively playing creatures like Delver of Secrets, Young Pyromancer, and Snapcaster Mage to apply pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes card draw and manipulation spells like Serum Visions and Opt to ensure consistency. By combining these elements, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's resources and win through creature damage or by using powerful finishers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor."
