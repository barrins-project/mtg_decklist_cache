This mana is used to cast big threats like Wurmcoil Engine, Walking Ballista, and Karn Liberated, while also using control elements like Oblivion Stone and Fatal Push to deal with opposing threats. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while establishing its own powerful board presence, ultimately overwhelming the opponent with its efficient and versatile threats."
