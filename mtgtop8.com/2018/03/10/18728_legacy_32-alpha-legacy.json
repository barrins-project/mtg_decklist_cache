The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to control the board. The mana base is designed to support the aggressive gameplay with a mix of dual lands and fetch lands, along with utility lands like Wasteland and Grove of the Burnwillows. Ultimately, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of aggression and disruption."

The deck includes various ways to find and protect these combo pieces, such as Crop Rotation, Sylvan Scrying, and Pithing Needle. Additionally, disruption spells like Thoughtseize and Duress help to control the opponent's hand, while cards like Vampire Hexmage and Not of This World provide protection for the combo. The deck aims to win the game through this powerful combo as quickly and efficiently as possible."
