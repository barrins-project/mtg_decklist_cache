The deck also includes cards like Wellwisher and Essence Warden to sustain the Elf tribal strategy while generating additional value with cards like Distant Melody and Lead the Stampede. Viridian Longbow provides a way to deal with enemy threats, while the mana base is optimized to ensure a consistent stream of Elves onto the battlefield."
