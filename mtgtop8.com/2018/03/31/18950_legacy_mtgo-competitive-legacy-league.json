            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to deal consistent damage to the opponent through a combination of direct burn spells and aggressive creatures. By utilizing cards like Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, and Fireblast, as well as creatures like Goblin Guide and Eidolon of the Great Revel, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and finish them off with finishing spells like Price of Progress and Sulfuric Vortex. The inclusion of cards like Pyrostatic Pillar and Searing Blood also helps to control the opponent's board while maintaining a fast pace of damage output."
