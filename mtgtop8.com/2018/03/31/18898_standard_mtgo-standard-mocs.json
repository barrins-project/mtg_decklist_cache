By using cards like Commune with Dinosaurs to search for key creatures, and cards like Abrade to control the board, this deck aims to establish dominance early on. With powerful dinosaurs like Regisaur Alpha and Ghalta, Primal Hunger, this deck can quickly build a threatening board presence. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Struggle / Survive and Rekindling Phoenix provide additional versatility and resilience. Overall, this deck focuses on fast, aggressive gameplay with a focus on dinosaur synergy."

The goal is to apply pressure early with efficient creatures like Glint-Sleeve Siphoner and Champion of Wits, while using removal spells like Fatal Push and Vraska's Contempt to deal with threats. The deck also utilizes powerful late-game threats such as The Scarab God and Torrential Gearhulk to close out games. The mana base is designed to support both the aggressive and controlling aspects of the deck."
