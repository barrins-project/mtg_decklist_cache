By utilizing cards like Devoted Druid, Vizier of Remedies, and Walking Ballista, the deck can generate infinite mana and deal lethal damage. This strategy is supported by cards like Collected Company and Chord of Calling to tutor for specific creatures, as well as disruptive elements like Reflector Mage and Spell Queller to control the game. The deck's mana base is designed to support its multicolor requirements and provide flexibility in casting spells."
