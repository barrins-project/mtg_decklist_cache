By utilizing cards like Delver of Secrets, Nimble Mongoose, and Hooting Mandrills, the deck aims to apply pressure early on. Counterspells such as Daze, Force of Will, and Spell Pierce help to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Dismember deal with threats. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to the deck's spells, ensuring a smooth and effective gameplay experience."
