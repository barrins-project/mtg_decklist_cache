Faeries like Mistbind Clique and Scion of Oona provide powerful synergies with other creatures and help to establish a strong board presence. The deck is designed to outvalue the opponent with card advantage from cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor, while also having some removal options like Fatal Push and Go for the Throat."
