By utilizing cards like Glint-Sleeve Siphoner and Whirler Virtuoso alongside powerful planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Liliana, Death's Majesty, the deck aims to control the board while dealing consistent damage to the opponent. The inclusion of cards like The Scarab God and Gonti, Lord of Luxury provides additional value and card advantage, making it difficult for the opponent to keep up with the aggressive strategy."
