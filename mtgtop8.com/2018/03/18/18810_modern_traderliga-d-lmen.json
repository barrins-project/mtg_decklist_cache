The key strategy is to maintain control of the game by disrupting the opponent's plays with counterspells like Logic Knot and Cryptic Command, while also removing threats with cards like Path to Exile and Detention Sphere. The deck aims to win through incremental advantages and card advantage, eventually winning with powerful threats like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Entreat the Angels. The mana base is optimized for consistency and can support the deck's heavy blue and white requirements."
