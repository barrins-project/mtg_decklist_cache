The inclusion of disruptive cards like Wasteland and Deathrite Shaman further disrupt the opponent's mana base, while cards like Force of Will and Spell Pierce allow the deck to protect its threats and maintain pressure on the opponent."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up its own win conditions, like True-Name Nemesis and equipment such as Umezawa's Jitte and Batterskull. By efficiently managing resources and being proactive in setting up advantageous board states, this deck can outmaneuver and outlast its opponents in a Legacy 1 vs 1 format."
