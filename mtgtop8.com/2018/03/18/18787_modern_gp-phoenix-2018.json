By playing cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Meddling Mage to disrupt opponents' strategies, while boosting the power of your own creatures with cards like Thalia's Lieutenant and Champion of the Parish, it aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive attacks. A key aspect of the deck is also the use of Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play at instant speed, allowing for surprise plays and maintaining pressure on the opponent."

It establishes early game board presence with defensive creatures like Wall of Omens and disrupts opponents' mana bases with cards like Spreading Seas and Field of Ruin. The win condition is through efficient removal and countering threats until the late game, where it can take control with planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Gideon Jura."
