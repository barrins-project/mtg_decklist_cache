The deck also utilizes ramp spells like Utopia Sprawl and Arbor Elf to accelerate its mana production, allowing it to quickly deploy threats like Inferno Titan and Bloodbraid Elf. The inclusion of Pia and Kiran Nalaar provides additional ways to pressure the opponent while generating value. Overall, the deck seeks to dominate the battlefield and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
