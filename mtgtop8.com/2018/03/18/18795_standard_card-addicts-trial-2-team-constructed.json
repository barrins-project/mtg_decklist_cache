This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive threats while also having some removal and protection spells like Fatal Push, Vraska's Contempt, and Blossoming Defense to deal with opposing threats and ensure the longevity of its creatures. By combining creatures with strong enters-the-battlefield effects and powerful buffs, this deck can quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
