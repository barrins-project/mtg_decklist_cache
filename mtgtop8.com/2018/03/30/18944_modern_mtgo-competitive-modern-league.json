The deck contains a variety of cycling creatures and spells, as well as cascade spells like Violent Outburst and Demonic Dread to cascade into Living End. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures while disrupting their land base with cards like Fulminator Mage and Avalanche Riders. The deck also has ways to deal with graveyard hate through cards like Faerie Macabre."
