By utilizing these token generators, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a large number of creatures. Cards like Renegade Map and Fatal Push provide flexibility and removal options, while Settle the Wreckage can help clear the opponent's board if needed. The deck also includes some lifegain options like Sunscourge Champion and Regal Caracal to help stabilize in longer games. Overall, the strategy is to establish a strong board presence and beat down the opponent quickly."
