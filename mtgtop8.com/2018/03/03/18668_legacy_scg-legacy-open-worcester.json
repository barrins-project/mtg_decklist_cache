The deck also aims to generate additional value through Young Pyromancer and spell-slinging cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder.

The deck also includes tools for removal and card advantage, such as Punishing Fire and Gamble.

It also includes disruptive elements like Chalice of the Void and Ensnaring Bridge to control the board, while using planeswalkers like Tezzeret and Dack Fayden for card advantage and additional artifact synergy. With a mix of acceleration from Mox Diamond and powerful removal options like Toxic Deluge, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly with a combination of aggression and resource denial."
