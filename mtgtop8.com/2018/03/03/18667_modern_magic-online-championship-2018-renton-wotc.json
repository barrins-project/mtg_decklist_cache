By protecting the creature from targeted removal with cards like Leyline of Sanctity and Slippery Bogle, and boosting its power with auras like Ethereal Armor and Daybreak Coronet, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a hexproof, buffed up threat that is difficult to deal with. Additionally, the deck includes some removal and card draw to help maintain tempo and board presence."

The use of delve creatures like Gurmag Angler and Tasigur, the Golden Fang allow for efficient use of the graveyard, while cards like Street Wraith and Flameblade Adept provide additional value in enabling quick attacks and damage output. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and powerful creatures."
