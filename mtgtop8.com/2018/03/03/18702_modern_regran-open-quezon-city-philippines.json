By casting multiple spells in one turn, the deck can quickly build up storm count and finish off the opponent with a lethal Grapeshot. The deck also utilizes card draw with Serum Visions, Opt, and Take Inventory to keep the combo going. Ultimately, the goal is to assemble the right combination of cards to create a powerful storm turn and win the game in one explosive sequence."

It also includes disruptive elements like Eidolon of the Great Revel to hinder the opponent's game plan. The land base is designed to provide consistent access to the necessary colors for casting spells effectively. The key strategy is to maintain pressure on the opponent and prevent them from stabilizing, ultimately winning through relentless aggression and burn spells."
