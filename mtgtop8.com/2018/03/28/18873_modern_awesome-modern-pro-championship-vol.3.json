The deck aims to build a strong board presence quickly with cards like Champion of the Parish and Thalia's Lieutenant, while also leveraging the synergy between creatures with abilities like Reflector Mage and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben. Aether Vial helps to cheat creatures into play and the mana base is optimized for casting Humans efficiently. This deck aims to control the tempo of the game and win through quick, efficient aggression."

The goal is to create a never-ending stream of creatures onto the battlefield, overwhelming your opponent with a constant barrage of threats.

            "notes": "The deck focuses on assembling UrzaTron (Urza's Tower, Power Plant, and Mine) to produce a large amount of mana in order to play powerful colorless threats like Karn Liberated, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. It utilizes removal spells like Oblivion Stone and Dismember to control the board and stay alive until its powerful late-game threats can take over the game. The deck also includes ramp spells like Ancient Stirrings and Sylvan Scrying to quickly find the UrzaTron pieces and Expedition Map to search for specific lands as needed."
