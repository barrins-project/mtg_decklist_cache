By combining land ramp with bounce lands and utility lands like Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion and Slayers' Stronghold, the deck can generate massive amounts of mana and overwhelm opponents with large creatures. The inclusion of Summoner's Pact and Tolaria West enables the deck to tutor for key cards, while cards like Explore and Ancient Stirrings help to find the necessary pieces to execute the combo efficiently."
