The burn spells like Magma Spray and Unlicensed Disintegration can help clear the way for your creatures, while cards like Hazoret the Fervent provide a powerful late-game threat. Overall, the goal is to keep the pressure on and finish the game quickly."

It relies on powerful control spells like Disallow and Vraska's Contempt to deal with threats, while utilizing card draw from Glimmer of Genius and Search for Azcanta to maintain resources. The Scarab God and Torrential Gearhulk provide additional value by recurring powerful spells from the graveyard. The deck aims to outlast opponents by controlling the game until it can win through incremental advantage."
