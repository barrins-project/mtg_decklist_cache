The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punishes opponents for playing spells, providing additional pressure on the opponent. Overall, this deck aims to be fast and relentless in dealing damage to secure a quick victory."

The key strategy is to lower your life total quickly to pump up the power of Death's Shadow while also disrupting your opponent's hand with discard spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek. The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to control the board, as well as Tarmogoyf for additional pressure. Liliana of the Veil and Liliana, the Last Hope provide additional utility and card advantage to keep the pressure on your opponent."

By protecting the creature with a Leyline of Sanctity and buffing it with Ethereal Armor, Rancor, and other auras, the deck aims to deal significant damage while minimizing the opponent's ability to disrupt the strategy. With a low curve and a mix of offensive and defensive options, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
