By controlling the board with cards like Spreading Seas and Harbinger of the Tides, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident, boosting the power and toughness of all Merfolk on the battlefield. Synergies between Merfolk creatures and spells like Merrow Reejerey and Kumena's Speaker help maintain pressure and tempo throughout the game."
