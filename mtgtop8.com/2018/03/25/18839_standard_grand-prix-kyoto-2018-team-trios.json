By using cards like Aethersphere Harvester, Unlicensed Disintegration, and Abrade, the deck aims to control the board and keep the opponent on the back foot. Cards like Hazoret the Fervent and Rekindling Phoenix provide powerful late-game threats that can quickly close out a game if left unchecked. With a mix of cheap creatures and removal spells, this deck aims to be fast and efficient in taking down the opponent's life total."
