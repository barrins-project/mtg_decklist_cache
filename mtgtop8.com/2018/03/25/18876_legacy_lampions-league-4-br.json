            "notes": "The main concept of this UR Aggro deck is to quickly and aggressively overwhelm the opponent with low-cost, high-impact creatures and burn spells. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan with counterspells like Daze and Force of Will, while also dealing direct damage with cards like Price of Progress, Lightning Bolt, and Fireblast. The deck also utilizes cantrips like Brainstorm and Ponder to draw through the deck quickly and find the necessary threats and answers. Overall, the key strategy is to apply pressure early and efficiently close out the game."
