The key strategy is to utilize cards like Deeproot Elite and Merfolk Mistbinder to pump up the team, while also generating card advantage with Silvergill Adept and Merfolk Branchwalker. Kumena, Tyrant of Orazca serves as both a powerful creature and a card advantage engine, allowing for further pressure. The inclusion of Hadana's Climb provides a potential win condition by transforming a creature into a powerful threat. In summary, this deck aims to establish a strong board presence early and maintain pressure throughout the game."

With cards such as Jadelight Ranger, Verdurous Gearhulk, and Winding Constrictor, you can build up your creatures while also maintaining hand advantage with Glint-Sleeve Siphoner. Additionally, cards like Hadana's Climb and Bristling Hydra provide additional ways to pump up your creatures and close out games efficiently. By combining aggressive creatures with removal and protection spells, this Golgari Aggro deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board control throughout the game."

The deck aims to protect itself with permission spells like Essence Scatter and Disallow, while also maintaining card advantage through Search for Azcanta and Glimmer of Genius. The win condition of the deck is to cast Approach of the Second Sun twice, either through regular casting or cycling it back into the deck with Torrential Gearhulk."
