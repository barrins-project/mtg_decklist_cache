The deck aims to bring back powerful creatures like Champion of Wits and Angel of Invention from the graveyard with the Gift's ability. Cards like Search for Azcanta and Ixalan's Binding help control the board while providing card advantage. The deck also includes some lifegain and removal options to survive until the late game where it can overwhelm the opponent with its resurrected creatures."
