The deck also includes protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense to keep your creatures safe and ensure that your lethal hits go through. The deck aims to win the game through the infect mechanic by dealing 10 poison counters to the opponent."

The deck aims to cycle through its library efficiently with cantrips like Opt and Serum Visions, while also combining cards like Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer to reduce the cost of spells. The end goal is to cast a large Grapeshot spell to deal lethal damage to the opponent, achieving victory through a powerful combo sequence."
