This mana is then used to cast powerful threats such as Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Wurmcoil Engine to control the game and outvalue the opponent. The deck also includes tools like Ghost Quarter, Expedition Map, and Sylvan Scrying to find the Urza lands efficiently and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Additionally, cards like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus provide control and graveyard hate."
