Utilizing powerful control spells like Cryptic Command and Snapcaster Mage, along with threats like Thing in the Ice and Young Pyromancer, this deck aims to disrupt your opponent's game plan and ultimately overpower them with a well-timed finisher. With a focus on tempo and card advantage, this deck excels at outplaying opponents through careful decision-making and resource management."
