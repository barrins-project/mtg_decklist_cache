The deck also has recursion with Crucible of Worlds and Academy Ruins to reuse key pieces. The main goal is to grind opponents down to a halt and win through attrition by denying them resources and slowly chipping away at their life total."

Cards like Faithless Looting and Cathartic Reunion help to fuel the graveyard while Life from the Loam ensures a steady stream of land drops. Conflagrate is used as a finisher, dealing damage based on the number of cards in hand and in the graveyard. Overall, the key strategy is to quickly fill the graveyard with key combo pieces and overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of powerful creatures."
