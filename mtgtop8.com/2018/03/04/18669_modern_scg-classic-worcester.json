The deck also includes a balance of removal spells like Lightning Bolt, Fatal Push, and Terminate to deal with threats. Additionally, Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek help to strip away key cards from the opponent's hand. The mana base is designed to provide flexibility and consistency in casting spells while also being able to disrupt the opponent's mana base with Field of Ruin."
