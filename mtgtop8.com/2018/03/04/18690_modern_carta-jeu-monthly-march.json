The deck also includes plenty of tools for control and removal, such as Oblivion Stone and Dismember, as well as card draw and deck manipulation with cards like Expedition Map and Ancient Stirrings.

The deck focuses on protecting its own life total and reducing the opponent's resources through cards like Path to Exile and Cryptic Command. The Planeswalkers and creatures in the deck provide additional threats and card advantage, while also offering control options. Overall, the deck aims to slow down the opponent's game plan and take over the game with powerful late-game plays."
