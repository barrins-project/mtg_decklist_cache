It aims to generate value through cards like Koth of the Hammer and Pia and Kiran Nalaar, while clearing the board with Pyroclasm and Lightning Bolt. The deck also has tools to disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Relic of Progenitus and Sorcerous Spyglass. Ultimately, the goal is to establish dominance and close out the game efficiently."
