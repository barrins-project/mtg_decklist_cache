These creatures, such as Griselbrand and Iona, Shield of Emeria, have a big impact on the game and can help secure victory. The deck also includes disruption cards like Thoughtseize and Force of Will to protect its combo pieces and disrupt the opponent's game plan. By combining powerful creatures with efficient spells, the deck aims to execute its game plan and win the game before the opponent can establish their own strategy."
