By aggressively discarding cards, the deck can drop large threats like Gurmag Angler and Flamewake Phoenix into play for little to no cost. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast, powerful creatures that are difficult to deal with efficiently. It also has a burn package with Lightning Bolt and Collective Brutality to finish off opponents or deal with threats."

By efficiently removing threats with cards like Lightning Bolt and Abrupt Decay, disrupting the opponent's hand with Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, and generating card advantage with Dark Confidant and Liliana of the Veil, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly. Tarmogoyf and Bloodbraid Elf serve as the main beaters, while versatile cards like Kolaghan's Command provide additional flexibility in dealing with various threats."
