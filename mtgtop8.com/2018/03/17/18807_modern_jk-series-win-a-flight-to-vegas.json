With efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay, combined with disruptive spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while deploying threats quickly. Utilizing the Delirium mechanic with Tarmogoyf and Traverse the Ulvenwald, the deck is able to consistently apply pressure and overwhelm the opponent. The inclusion of Liliana of the Veil and Stubborn Denial provides additional disruption and protection for your key threats."
