By using cards like Adorned Pouncer, Legion's Landing, and Servo Exhibition, the player can quickly build a board presence. The key strategy is to buff these creatures with Appeal / Authority and use cards like Sram's Expertise to flood the board with more tokens. Skysovereign, Consul Flagship and Aethersphere Harvester provide additional value and power to help push through for a quick victory. Overall, the deck aims to win through aggressive token generation and buffing."
