The deck includes efficient creatures with abilities that benefit from these counters, such as Winding Constrictor and Bristling Hydra, as well as removal spells like Vraska's Contempt to deal with threats. Hadana's Climb serves as both a mana accelerator and a win condition by transforming into Winged Temple of Orazca, allowing for explosive plays. Overall, the deck aims to be proactive and aggressive, while maintaining resilience through card advantage and protection with cards like Blossoming Defense."
