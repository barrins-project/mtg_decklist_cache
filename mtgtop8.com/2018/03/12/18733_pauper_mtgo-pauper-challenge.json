The deck utilizes efficient creatures like Skarrgan Pit-Skulk and Silhana Ledgewalker, along with pump spells like Rancor and Elephant Guide to maximize damage output. By utilizing cards like Nest Invader and Burning-Tree Emissary for additional mana acceleration, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and maintain that pressure throughout the game. The inclusion of cards like Vines of Vastwood and Hunger of the Howlpack also provide additional ways to enhance the aggression of the deck."
