The deck also includes win conditions like Helm of Obedience and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to close out the game once it has established control. It is a versatile and adaptable deck that can handle a variety of threats."

The deck also includes a lot of card draw and countermagic to protect the combo and maintain consistency. The key is to efficiently get big threats onto the battlefield while disrupting the opponent?s game plan."
