The deck aims to control the board with cards like Fatal Push and Vraska's Contempt while also generating value through cards like Treasure Map and Tezzeret the Schemer. The win condition is to either drain the opponent's life total with Marionette Master or create a massive Walking Ballista. The deck has a strong mana base with a mix of swamps, islands, and dual lands to ensure consistency in casting spells."

By playing a steady stream of cheap and efficient creatures like Goblin Chainwhirler and Earthshaker Khenra, while also utilizing direct damage spells like Lightning Strike and Shock, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. The inclusion of cards like Hazoret the Fervent and Chandra, Torch of Defiance provide additional sources of damage and card advantage to keep the pressure on the opponent."
