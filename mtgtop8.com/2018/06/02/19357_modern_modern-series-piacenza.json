The deck also includes cards like Scapeshift and Summoner's Pact to help search for key pieces of the combo, while utilizing cards like Lightning Bolt and Sweltering Suns for removal and board control. The inclusion of Prismatic Omen further enhances the effectiveness of Valakut's ability, providing a powerful win condition in the late game."
