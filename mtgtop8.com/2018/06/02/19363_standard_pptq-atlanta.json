It aims to quickly develop a board presence by playing efficient threats like Knight of Malice, Karn, Scion of Urza, and Lyra Dawnbringer. Supporting cards like History of Benalia and Cast Out provide additional value and removal options. Vehicles like Heart of Kiran and powerful removal spells like Fatal Push help clear the path for attacks. The deck also includes recursion strategies with Scrapheap Scrounger and tools for early game aggression with Toolcraft Exemplar. Additionally, the mana base ensures consistent color availability for spells."
