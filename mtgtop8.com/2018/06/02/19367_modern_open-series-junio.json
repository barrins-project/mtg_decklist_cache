The deck also includes cards like Engineered Explosives and Pyrite Spellbomb for removal and reach. The key strategy is to carefully manage resources and set up the combo while controlling the board."

By using Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play at instant speed, alongside lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident to boost their power and toughness, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and resilient offense. Cards like Spreading Seas can also disrupt the opponent's mana base, further increasing the deck's chances for victory through tempo advantage and aggression."
