By dredging cards like Stinkweed Imp and Golgari Thug, the deck can trigger abilities like Prized Amalgam's return from the graveyard effect and create overwhelming board presence. Conflagrate provides a way to close out the game by dealing direct damage to the opponent. The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a powerful graveyard based strategy."

The deck also aims to generate value through card draw and recursion with cards like Snapcaster Mage and Ancestral Vision. Young Pyromancer and Thing in the Ice provide threats that can quickly close out the game if left unchecked. Overall, the deck focuses on maintaining control of the game and outlasting the opponent in the long run."
