The key strategy is to ramp up mana with cards like Llanowar Elves and Greenbelt Rampager to deploy threats like Steel Leaf Champion and Ghalta, Primal Hunger early in the game. The inclusion of Heart of Kiran and Scrapheap Scrounger provides additional pressure and resilience against removal spells. Overall, the goal is to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react while maintaining a strong board presence."
