Gifts Ungiven is used to tutor for key combo pieces and Past in Flames enables the player to reuse spells from the graveyard for maximum storm count."

This combo deck utilizes cards like Scrap Trawler, Myr Retriever, and Buried Ruin to recur sacrificed artifacts and continue generating value. The deck also includes a variety of mana ramp spells and card draw sources to help find the combo pieces quickly. By efficiently cycling through the deck and generating a large amount of mana, the deck aims to overpower the opponent and win the game in a single turn."
