By leveraging cards like Faithless Looting, Cathartic Reunion, and Life from the Loam, the deck aims to create a powerful board presence with Prized Amalgam and other creatures. Conflagrate serves as a finisher, dealing direct damage to the opponent while also allowing the player to discard cards from their graveyard for added value."
