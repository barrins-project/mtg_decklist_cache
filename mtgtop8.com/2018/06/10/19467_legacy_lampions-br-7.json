The deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on and finish them off with direct damage spells like Fireblast and Barbarian Ring. The inclusion of Eidolon of the Great Revel helps slow down the opponent's game plan while still pushing for damage. The deck's goal is to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."

By locking opponents out of playing spells with Blood Moon, Magus of the Moon, and City of Traitors, the deck aims to overwhelm them with powerful threats and finish the game quickly. The strategy revolves around a proactive game plan that punishes opponents for relying on non-basic lands and spells with varying converted mana costs."
