This combo allows you to cheat powerful creatures like Horror of the Broken Lands and Archfiend of Ifnir into play from your graveyard, overwhelming your opponent with a large army of creatures. Additional cards like Beast Within and Fulminator Mage provide disruption and removal to control the board and secure your victory."
