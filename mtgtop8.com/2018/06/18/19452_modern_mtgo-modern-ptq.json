The goal is to create a powerful graveyard-based engine that can overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of threats, making it difficult for them to keep up with the sheer value and card advantage generated by the combo."

The deck also aims to draw cards and generate advantage with cards like Opt, Snapcaster Mage, Jace, the Mind Sculptor, and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. The inclusion of counterspells like Negate and Mana Leak further enhances the control aspect of the deck, while cards like Search for Azcanta provide card selection and filtering. The win condition comes from finishing off the opponent with powerful threats like Entreat the Angels or Celestial Colonnade."
