Cards like Kopala, Warden of Waves and Kumena, Tyrant of Orazca provide additional protection and card advantage, while disruption cards like Merfolk Trickster and Spell Pierce help control the tempo of the game. Overall, the strategy revolves around overwhelming the opponent with a fast and aggressive Merfolk tribal deck."
