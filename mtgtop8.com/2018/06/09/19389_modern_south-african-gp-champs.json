This allows the player to cast powerful threats such as Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Wurmcoil Engine. The deck also includes various search spells like Expedition Map and Ancient Stirrings to find the necessary pieces, as well as control elements like Mana Leak and Oblivion Stone to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with massive threats and mana advantage."
