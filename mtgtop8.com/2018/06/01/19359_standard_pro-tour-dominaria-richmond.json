With a mix of spot removal, board wipes, and counters, the deck can answer a wide variety of threats while maintaining a strong board presence. The deck's strength lies in its ability to adapt to different situations and outvalue opponents over the long game."

Liliana, Death's Majesty provides recursion and value, while cards like Knight of Malice and Dread Shade offer additional aggression.

It also includes cards like Jadelight Ranger and Champion of Wits to fuel graveyard interactions and card draw. Llanowar Elves and other mana ramp creatures help with early game acceleration, while Walking Ballista provides removal and flexibility. The deck aims to be aggressive with a mix of strong creatures and recursion abilities, putting pressure on opponents while maintaining card advantage and board presence."
