By consistently dredging cards into the graveyard, the player can easily generate value and set up powerful plays with cards like Conflagrate and Prized Amalgam. The combination of discard outlets like Cathartic Reunion and Faithless Looting, along with dredge creatures like Stinkweed Imp and Golgari Thug, allows for a fast and explosive gameplay style."

By aggressively attacking with Flamewake Phoenix, Bloodghast, and Gurmag Angler, you aim to put pressure on your opponent early in the game. The deck also includes removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Collective Brutality to handle threats from the opponent. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm your opponent with fast and powerful creatures while disrupting their game plan with discard spells."

The deck aims to control the game by countering or removing threats while building up to powerful late-game plays like Celestial Colonnade and Secure the Wastes. With a mix of efficient removal, card draw, and permission spells, the deck seeks to outlast and outmaneuver opponents until it can secure victory through overwhelming advantage or a carefully executed win condition."
