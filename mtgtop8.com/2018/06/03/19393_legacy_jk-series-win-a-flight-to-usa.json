It utilizes various cheap cantrips and counterspells to protect the combo and ensure its success. The key strategy involves cheating massive creatures into play ahead of schedule and overwhelming the opponent with their powerful abilities. The deck aims to win games through explosive plays and quickly closing out the game before the opponent has a chance to respond."

It then looks to stabilize the board with Terminus and removal spells like Swords to Plowshares. The deck also includes a small win condition with Entreat the Angels and can control the opponent's board with Council's Judgment and Counterbalance. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's control elements."
