The deck also utilizes cards like Inkmoth Nexus for infect damage and Galvanic Blast for extra reach. Karn, Scion of Urza provides card advantage and disruption while Etched Champion and Master of Etherium provide resilience and additional power. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy that can quickly close out games."
