With cards like Arcbound Ravager and Steel Overseer to pump up the team, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a quick and aggressive strategy. The deck also includes some control elements like Etched Champion and Welding Jar to protect key pieces and keep the pressure on the opponent. Overall, this deck is all about speed, aggression, and efficient use of artifacts."
