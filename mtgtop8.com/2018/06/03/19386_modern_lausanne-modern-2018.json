By using cards like Champion of the Parish, Thalia's Lieutenant, and Aether Vial, the deck can quickly build a powerful board presence that is hard for the opponent to deal with. Additionally, cards like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter disrupt the opponent's game plan, allowing the deck to maintain its aggressive strategy while keeping the opponent on the back foot. The deck's mana base is also built to support its human-focused strategy, with lands like Cavern of Souls and Unclaimed Territory helping to ensure that the deck can consistently cast its spells."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on using small, evasive creatures like Blighted Agent and Glistener Elf to quickly deal poison counters to the opponent and win the game. Cards like Rancor and Wild Defiance help pump up these creatures, while spells like Become Immense and Mutagenic Growth provide additional ways to increase their power. Protection spells like Apostle's Blessing and Vines of Vastwood help keep the creatures safe from removal, while accelerants like Noble Hierarch help ramp up the strategy. Overall, the key concept of the deck is to quickly assemble a combo of infect creatures and pump spells to win the game efficiently."
