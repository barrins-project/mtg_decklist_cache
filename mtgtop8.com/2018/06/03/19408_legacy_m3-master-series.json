The deck leverages a combination of low-cost creatures like Delver of Secrets and Deathrite Shaman alongside high-impact threats like True-Name Nemesis and Gurmag Angler to pressure opponents and close out games quickly. By utilizing a mix of disruptive spells and threats, this deck aims to control the pace of the game and come out ahead in the early stages of the match."
