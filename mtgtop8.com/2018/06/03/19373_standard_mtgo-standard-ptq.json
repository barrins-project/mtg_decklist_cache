Cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, Settle the Wreckage, and Disallow help to control the board and opponent's actions. Search for Azcanta provides card selection and advantage, while Fumigate and Seal Away help deal with threats. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent and win through incremental advantages, outlasting the opponent until victory is achieved through Teferi's ultimate ability or overwhelming card advantage."
