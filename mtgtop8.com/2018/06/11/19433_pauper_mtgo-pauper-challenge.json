By quickly ramping up mana with cards like Llanowar Elves and Priest of Titania, and then using Timberwatch Elf to boost the power of the Elves, this deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of cards like Wellwisher also provides a source of lifegain to help sustain the aggressive strategy. Lead the Stampede and Distant Melody ensure a steady stream of Elves to keep up the pressure."
