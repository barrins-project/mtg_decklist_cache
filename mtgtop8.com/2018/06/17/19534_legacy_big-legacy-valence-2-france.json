It utilizes Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play and disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Phyrexian Revoker and Thalia, Heretic Cathar. The mana denial strategy with cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port helps to slow down opponents and gain a tempo advantage. Karakas and Flickerwisp provide additional utility and disruption options."

The inclusion of Terminus and Supreme Verdict helps to control the board, while Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional card advantage and win conditions. The deck aims to grind out the opponent by outvaluing them and ultimately winning through cards like Entreat the Angels."

            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to establish early board presence with cheap, efficient creatures like Young Pyromancer and Delver of Secrets, while disrupting your opponent's game plan with counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce. Additionally, the deck aims to control the board by using removal spells such as Lightning Bolt and Dismember, and mana denial through cards like Wasteland. The deck also has card advantage and manipulation with Ponder, Brainstorm, and Gitaxian Probe, allowing for consistent draws and ensuring maximum efficiency in playing threats and answers."
