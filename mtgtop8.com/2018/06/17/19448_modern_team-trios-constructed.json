The deck also includes cantrips like Serum Visions and Sleight of Hand to dig for combo pieces and maintain a consistent draw engine."

            "notes": "This deck aims to control the game by assembling the UrzaTron lands to generate a large amount of mana quickly. It utilizes powerful threats like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger to dominate the board. Alongside these threats, it includes removal spells like Oblivion Stone and utility cards like Relic of Progenitus to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck focuses on ramping up mana, finding the necessary pieces with Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying, and ultimately overwhelming the opponent with its big creatures and spells."
