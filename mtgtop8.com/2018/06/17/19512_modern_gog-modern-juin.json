By playing cards like Heritage Druid, Elvish Archdruid, and Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx, the deck can quickly produce a substantial amount of mana to pay for expensive spells like Shaman of the Pack and Craterhoof Behemoth. Cards like Chord of Calling and Collected Company help to find the necessary combo pieces quickly, while cards like Ezuri, Renegade Leader provide a powerful pump effect to close out the game."
