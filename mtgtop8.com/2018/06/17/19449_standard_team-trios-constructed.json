The deck also includes burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock to target both creatures and the opponent directly. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. This archetype aims to win through damage rather than relying on complex strategies or card advantage."
