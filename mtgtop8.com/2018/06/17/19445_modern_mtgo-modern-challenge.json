By combining creatures like Monastery Swiftspear, Goblin Guide, and Grim Lavamancer with powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt, Boros Charm, and Lava Spike, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero. The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Searing Blaze helps to control the board and punish opponents for casting spells, ultimately allowing the deck to win the game before the opponent can stabilize."

Cards like Voice of Resurgence and Eternal Witness provide value and recursion, while mana ramp creatures like Noble Hierarch and Lotus Cobra help accelerate the deck's game plan. Additionally, the deck includes utility creatures like Acidic Slime for disruption. The key strategy is to assemble the combo pieces while controlling the board with removal spells like Path to Exile."

The deck also utilizes control elements like Karn Liberated, Oblivion Stone, and Ghost Quarter to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect itself. Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying help to quickly assemble the Tron lands, while Ancient Stirrings digs for key cards. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."
