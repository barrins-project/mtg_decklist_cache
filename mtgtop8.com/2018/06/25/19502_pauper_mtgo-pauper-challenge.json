            "notes": "The deck revolves around playing cheap artifacts to reduce the cost of powerful creatures like Myr Enforcer and Frogmite, while also enabling fast finishes with cards like Fling and Temur Battle Rage. The deck utilizes spells like Thoughtcast and Gitaxian Probe to dig for key pieces and burn spells like Galvanic Blast to control the board and finish off opponents. The land base is primarily made up of artifact lands to support the affinity mechanic, allowing for explosive starts and aggressive plays."
