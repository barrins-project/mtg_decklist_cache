The key strategy is to use Standstill to keep the opponent from playing cards while building up Myth Realized as a win condition. Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Snapcaster Mage provide additional card advantage and flexibility. The deck also includes Terminus as a board wipe and options for creature removal. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency and access to different colors of mana."
