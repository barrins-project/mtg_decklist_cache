The deck aims to ramp up its mana quickly with cards like Veteran Explorer and Evolutionary Leap to cast its threats ahead of schedule. Lingering Souls provides a recurring source of creature tokens, while Pernicious Deed acts as a versatile board wipe. The deck utilizes a toolbox approach with Green Sun's Zenith to find the right answer for any situation."
