The deck aims to protect its planeswalkers, Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, and win condition, Secure the Wastes, by mana denial and controlling the board state. Using utility lands and versatile spells like Cryptic Command, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind them out in a long game, eventually overwhelming them with superior card advantage and powerful threats."
