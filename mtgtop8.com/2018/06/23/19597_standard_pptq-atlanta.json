Cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and The Scarab God provide card advantage and powerful late-game threats, while removal spells like Vraska's Contempt and Cast Down keep the opponent's creatures in check. Additionally, counterspells like Syncopate and Disallow allow the player to control the flow of the game and protect their own key cards. The deck also includes card draw and filtering with Search for Azcanta and Glimmer of Genius to ensure consistency in drawing key cards and managing resources effectively."
