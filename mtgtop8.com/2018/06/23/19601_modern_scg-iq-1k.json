The deck also includes disruption in the form of Spell Pierce and Spellskite to protect against opposing spells and creatures. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency and fast mana development."

By utilizing cards like Cryptic Command, Mana Leak, and Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, the deck aims to control the board and outvalue the opponent. Cards like Settle the Wreckage and Supreme Verdict provide board wipes in case of overwhelming threats, while Sphinx's Revelation and Search for Azcanta help with card draw and selection. The deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a dominating position with its control elements."
