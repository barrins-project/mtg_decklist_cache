            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to win quickly by dealing direct damage to the opponent using burn spells and efficient creatures. The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Searing Blaze and Lightning Bolt while applying pressure with creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear. The goal is to maintain a fast pace and overwhelm the opponent before they can set up their own game plan. The mana base is designed to support casting spells early and consistently, allowing for a high level of aggression throughout the game."
