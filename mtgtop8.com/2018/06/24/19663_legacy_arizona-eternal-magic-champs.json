The win condition is typically casting a high storm count Tendrils of Agony or Ad Nauseam for a big finish. The deck plays a variety of dual lands to ensure it can cast its spells efficiently and consistently. The key is to carefully manage resources and timing to go off and win the game before the opponent can stop you."

Ad Nauseam is a powerful card draw engine that can refill the hand with more combo pieces. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a storm of spells before they can establish their own game plan."
