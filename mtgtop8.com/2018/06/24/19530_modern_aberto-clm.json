Collected Company allows for explosive creature plays, while cards like Spell Queller and Reflector Mage disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also includes cards like Meddling Mage and Voice of Resurgence to control the board and protect your own creatures. The mana base is optimized for consistency and allows for versatility in casting spells of different colors."

The rest of the deck is filled out with burn spells and lands that can help filter and produce the required mana to execute the combo effectively."
