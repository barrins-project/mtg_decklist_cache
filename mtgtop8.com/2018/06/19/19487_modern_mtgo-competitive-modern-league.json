It also includes various mana-producing artifacts to accelerate the deck's aggressive strategy. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a mix of small creatures and powerful equipment, while also having the ability to protect its key threats with cards like Etched Champion and Welding Jar. Additionally, Karn, Scion of Urza provides card advantage and additional threats to maintain pressure on opponents."
