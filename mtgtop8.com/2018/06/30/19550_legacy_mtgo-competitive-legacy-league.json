Removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push deal with threats on the board, while mix of Snapcaster Mage, Baleful Strix, and Leovold, Emissary of Trest provide value and card advantage.

Once enough mana is produced, the player can utilize cards like Time Spiral to draw into more resources and win the game. It also includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Flusterstorm to protect the combo. Cunning Wish adds versatility by allowing the player to search for key sideboard cards as needed. The deck aims to create a powerful storm turn that overwhelms the opponent and secures a win."
