Using Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play and cards like Phantasmal Image and Reflector Mage for additional value, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures like Mantis Rider and Champion of the Parish. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the Human tribal theme and ensure consistent plays throughout the game."

The deck relies on tutoring for combo pieces with Gifts Ungiven and then flashing them back with Past in Flames to generate a storm count high enough to win the game in a single turn. The deck aims to efficiently filter through the deck with cantrips like Sleight of Hand and Serum Visions while protecting the combo with counter spells like Remand."
