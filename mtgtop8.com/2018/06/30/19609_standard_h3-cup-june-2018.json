The deck utilizes powerful control spells such as Disallow, Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, and Settle the Wreckage to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while also gaining card advantage through Glimmer of Genius and Search for Azcanta. The win condition is typically achieved through casting Approach of the Second Sun twice, with additional options for card advantage and utility spells like Commit / Memory and Fumigate to further solidify the deck's control."
