By utilizing fast mana and efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, along with powerful creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can establish a strong defense or mount a comeback. The inclusion of Skullcrack and Eidolon of the Great Revel further disrupts the opponent's game plan and ensures that the deck can maintain its aggressive momentum."
