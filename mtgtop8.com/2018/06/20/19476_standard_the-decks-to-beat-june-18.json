By running a mix of counterspells like Disallow, Essence Scatter, and Syncopate, along with removal like Fatal Push and Vraska's Contempt, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Card advantage is also key, with cards like Glimmer of Genius and Search for Azcanta helping to draw into answers and threats. Teferi, Hero of Dominaria provides additional value with card advantage, removal, and the ability to untap lands for more control options."
