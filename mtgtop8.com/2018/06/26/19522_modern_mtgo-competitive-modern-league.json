By casting Ad Nauseam with the necessary mana ramp provided by cards like Lotus Bloom and Pentad Prism, you can draw your entire deck and play your win condition in the same turn to secure victory."

            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly ramp up mana using cards like Sakura-Tribe Elder and Farseek in order to efficiently cast powerful spells like Scapeshift and Primeval Titan. By combining the landfall triggers from Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle with the ability to fetch multiple Mountains with Scapeshift, the deck can deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent in a single turn. The inclusion of cards like Lightning Bolt and Slagstorm provides additional removal and burn spells to help control the board and finish off opponents."
