The key strategy involves using cards like Krark-Clan Ironworks, Scrap Trawler, and Myr Retriever to loop through sacrificing and returning artifacts, while also generating mana through cards like Terrarion and Mox Opal. The deck aims to assemble the combo pieces quickly and efficiently in order to overwhelm the opponent and win the game."
