The deck also utilizes planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Gideon of the Trials to control the board and generate card advantage. History of Benalia provides additional creature threats and Oath of Teferi synergizes with planeswalkers. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to all three colors of mana needed for the deck's spells."

Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and The Scarab God provide powerful late-game advantage. Removal spells like Fatal Push and Cast Out help maintain control of the battlefield. Hostage Taker can disrupt opponent's plans while Aryel, Knight of Windgrace offers additional creature and removal utility. Overall, the deck aims to pressure opponents quickly and efficiently while controlling the game state."
