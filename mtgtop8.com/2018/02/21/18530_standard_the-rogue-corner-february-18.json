            "notes": "The main idea of this Golgari Control deck is to disrupt your opponent's game plan by using a combination of hand disruption spells like Duress and Doomfall, along with removal spells like Fatal Push and Vraska's Contempt. The deck also has several ways to generate card advantage, such as Arch of Orazca and Azor's Gateway. Additionally, the deck has a strong late-game plan with cards like Hour of Promise and Mastermind's Acquisition to find key threats or answers. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can establish a winning board state."
