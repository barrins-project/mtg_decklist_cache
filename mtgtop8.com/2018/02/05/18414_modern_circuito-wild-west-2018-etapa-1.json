It includes control elements like Oblivion Stone and Karn Liberated to deal with threats, as well as big finishers like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The deck also includes ways to search for specific lands or cards with Sylvan Scrying and Ancient Stirrings. Overall, the key concept revolves around efficiently ramping up to play powerful threats and control the game."
