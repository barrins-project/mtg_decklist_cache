It includes various removal spells and protection spells to control the game while generating value with cards like Thraben Inspector and Grim Harvest. The deck also includes creatures with lifegain abilities to stall the game and protect against aggressive strategies. The goal is to outvalue the opponent with efficient removal, card advantage, and resilient threats, ultimately overwhelming them with the powerful recurring damage from Pestilence."
