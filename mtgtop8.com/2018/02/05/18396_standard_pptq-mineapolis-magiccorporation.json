The combination of Winding Constrictor and +1/+1 counters synergies ensures a strong offense while still maintaining some control elements with removal spells like Vraska's Contempt. With a mix of creatures, removal, and mana acceleration, this deck is designed to apply early pressure and maintain tempo throughout the game."

It aims to survive the early game with removal spells like Fatal Push and Vraska's Contempt, then stabilize the board with board wipes like Settle the Wreckage and Fumigate. The win condition is either by casting Approach of the Second Sun twice or by overwhelming the opponent with card advantage from Glimmer of Genius and Search for Azcanta. Torrential Gearhulk provides additional value by flashing back spells from the graveyard. The deck's mana base allows for consistency and flexibility in casting spells."
