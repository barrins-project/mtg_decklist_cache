The goal is to control the board early with removal spells like Magma Spray and Fatal Push, then play powerful threats like Rekindling Phoenix and Glorybringer to quickly deal damage to the opponent. The deck utilizes cards like Champion of Wits and The Scarab God for card advantage and resilience. Overall, the deck aims to pressure the opponent and outvalue them with its threats and removal spells."
