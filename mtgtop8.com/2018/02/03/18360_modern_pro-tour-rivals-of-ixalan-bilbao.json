The deck also has a few win conditions such as Pyrite Spellbomb and milling the opponent's deck using Codex Shredder and Pyxis of Pandemonium. The mana base is designed to support the deck's color requirements and includes utility lands like Inventors' Fair and Academy Ruins."

It utilizes cards like Sylvan Scrying and Expedition Map to search for the Tron lands efficiently, along with Ancient Stirrings to find key pieces. The deck also includes removal spells like Dismember and board wipes like Oblivion Stone to control the board. Overall, the strategy revolves around ramping quickly and overpowering opponents with huge threats."

The deck includes card draw and selection to help find combo pieces, along with disruption like Remand to protect the combo.

By creating token creatures with Young Pyromancer and Lingering Souls, while also removing threats with Lightning Bolt and Kolaghan's Command, the deck aims to maintain pressure and control the board. The inclusion of discard spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize helps disrupt the opponent's game plan while also fueling cards like Bedlam Reveler. Overall, this deck aims to be proactive and aggressive while maintaining a level of disruption."
