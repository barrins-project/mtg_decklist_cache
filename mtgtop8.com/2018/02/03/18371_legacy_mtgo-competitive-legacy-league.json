            "notes": "This deck is focused on generating a large amount of mana quickly through rituals and accelerants, then using card draw and selection to find the combo pieces needed to win the game. The key concept revolves around casting spells like Lion's Eye Diamond and Infernal Tutor to generate storm count, eventually leading to a lethal Tendrils of Agony. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Duress and Cabal Therapy to protect the combo. The goal is to quickly and efficiently assemble the necessary cards to storm off and win the game."
