            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to control the game through countering opponent's spells, manipulating the top cards of the library with cards like Counterbalance and Search for Azcanta, and removing threats with cards like Swords to Plowshares and Terminus. Using powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Snapcaster Mage, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and win through incremental advantage. The deck also includes cards like Unexpectedly Absent and Council's Judgment for additional flexibility in dealing with various threats."
