The deck's consistency and speed are further enhanced by cantrips like Ponder and Preordain, as well as card advantage from Gush."

The synergy between the artifacts and affinity creatures allows for efficient mana usage and aggressive plays, often overwhelming the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of burn spells like Galvanic Blast and combat tricks like Temur Battle Rage further enhance the deck's ability to quickly close out games."
