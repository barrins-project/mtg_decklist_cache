By using cards like Jace's Erasure, Accumulated Knowledge, and Quiet Disrepair, the deck aims to mill out the opponent's deck by drawing cards and countering threats with Fog effects like Moment's Peace and Tangle. The deck also includes card draw spells like Compulsive Research and Preordain to find the pieces needed for the combo. The lands are mostly focused on ensuring a consistent mana base for the deck."
