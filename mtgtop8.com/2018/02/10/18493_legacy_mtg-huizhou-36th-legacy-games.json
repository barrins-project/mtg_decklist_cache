The inclusion of disruptive cards like Containment Priest and Thalia, Heretic Cathar helps control the board while aggressive threats like Eldrazi Mimic apply pressure. Chalice of the Void and Thalia, Guardian of Thraben further disrupt opponents' game plans, making it difficult for them to effectively deal with the Eldrazi onslaught."

With the ability to bring out massive threats early in the game, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure a quick victory through a powerful combo.
