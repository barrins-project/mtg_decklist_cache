Thaumatic Compass and Search for Azcanta help with card selection and providing additional resources, while Ixalan's Binding and Cast Out provide removal options. The win condition comes from casting Approach of the Second Sun twice to secure victory. The mana base is designed to support the green ramp strategy while still providing access to all necessary colors for control spells."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on utilizing Refurbish to bring God-Pharaoh's Gift into play, allowing for powerful creatures like Angel of Invention and Champion of Wits to be constantly cycling in and out of the battlefield. By controlling the game with cards like Settle the Wreckage and Search for Azcanta, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with an army of resurrected creatures and card advantage. The strategy revolves around maintaining board control and out-valuing the opponent through constant creature recursion and card draw."
