The deck also includes cards like Glint-Sleeve Siphoner and Merfolk Branchwalker for card advantage and consistency. The deck utilizes removal spells like Ravenous Chupacabra and Vraska's Contempt to deal with threats, while also running a few defensive cards like Blossoming Defense and Aethersphere Harvester for protection. Overall, the deck aims to quickly build a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and powerful synergies."
