This aggressive strategy is supported by a suite of efficient removal spells and disruption to control the game and protect your threats. By efficiently managing your resources and leveraging the power of Death's Shadow, this deck aims to pressure opponents into making mistakes and overwhelming them with powerful creatures and spells."

By using a mix of direct damage spells and creature threats, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent can set up their own game plan. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack helps to disrupt the opponent's strategies and protect against lifegain effects."

This allows the player to play and activate powerful colorless threats like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and various Eldrazi creatures. The deck also includes removal spells like Dismember and Oblivion Stone to control the board while disrupting the opponent's strategy with cards like Relic of Progenitus. The goal is to outvalue the opponent by overwhelming them with big threats and efficient removal."
