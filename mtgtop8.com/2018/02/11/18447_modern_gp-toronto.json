The efficient use of auras and hexproof creatures allows for a aggressive and resilient strategy that can quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to respond."

By discarding creatures like Worldspine Wurm and Griselbrand, players can reanimate them for a powerful combo finish. The deck also utilizes cards like Faithless Looting and Night's Whisper to dig for combo pieces and generate card advantage. With the ability to bring out huge threats early in the game, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win before they can establish their own game plan."

The goal is to use Scapeshift to sacrifice lands and deal a large amount of damage to the opponent with Valakut triggers. This combo is supported by cards like Search for Tomorrow, Farseek, and Sakura-Tribe Elder to ensure that the player can quickly assemble the pieces needed to win the game. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Anger of the Gods and Lightning Bolt for removal and control."
