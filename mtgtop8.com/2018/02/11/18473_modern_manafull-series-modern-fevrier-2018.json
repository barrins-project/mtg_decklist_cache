The deck uses Eldrazi lands like Urza's Tower, Power Plant, and Mine to ramp into its bigger threats quickly. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain control throughout the game."

            "notes": "This deck focuses on building a strong board presence with aggressive Merfolk creatures and using cards like Aether Vial and Spreading Seas to disrupt the opponent's game plan. By quickly establishing a board full of Merfolk lords like Master of the Pearl Trident and Lord of Atlantis, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient beatdown strategy. The inclusion of Dispel and Harbinger of the Tides adds additional control elements to protect the Merfolk tribe and maintain pressure on the opponent."
