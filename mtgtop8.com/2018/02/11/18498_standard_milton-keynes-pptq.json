The deck aims to create a fast and aggressive start with cards like Skymarcher Aspirant and Legion's Landing, using the synergy between creatures like Metallic Mimic and Mavren Fein to generate a high volume of tokens. With cards like Angel of Invention adding even more pressure, the deck aims to close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
