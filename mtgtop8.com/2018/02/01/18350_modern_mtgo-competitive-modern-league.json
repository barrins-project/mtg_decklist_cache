Once a critical mass of elves is on the battlefield, cards like Elvish Archdruid and Ezuri, Renegade Leader can buff the team and overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of creatures. Collected Company and Chord of Calling provide additional flexibility and toolbox options for finding key combo pieces. Shaman of the Pack serves as a finisher, dealing damage based on the number of elves you control."
