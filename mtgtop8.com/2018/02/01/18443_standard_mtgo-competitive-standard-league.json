It achieves this through a combination of counter spells, removal spells, and card draw. The deck also utilizes powerful finishers like Torrential Gearhulk and The Scarab God to close out the game. With the help of cards like Search for Azcanta, the deck can effectively filter through its library to find the right answers and maintain card advantage. Overall, this deck aims to outlast the opponent and win through attrition."
