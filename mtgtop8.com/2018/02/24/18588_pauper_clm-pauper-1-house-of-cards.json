The deck is focused on fast aggression, using cards like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt to clear a path for creatures like Thraben Inspector and Kor Skyfisher to quickly deliver damage. Additionally, cards like Prophetic Prism and Alchemist's Vial provide card advantage and mana fixing, while cards like Palace Sentinels help to maintain control of the battlefield. The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent while efficiently managing resources to secure victory."
