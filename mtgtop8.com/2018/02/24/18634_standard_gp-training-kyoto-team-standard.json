Control elements like Baffling End and Ixalan's Binding help keep threats in check while Minister of Inquiries mills the opponent's deck. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent with powerful graveyard recursion and card advantage, ultimately winning through creature beats with tokens and reanimated creatures."
