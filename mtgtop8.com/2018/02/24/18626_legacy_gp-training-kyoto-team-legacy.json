The deck is designed to quickly close out games by controlling the board with removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push. The mana base is optimized for the Grixis color combination, allowing for flexibility in casting spells of different colors. Overall, the deck aims to win through a combination of early aggression and disruption."
