            "notes": "This deck is focused on playing aggressive creatures early on to deal damage to the opponent quickly and efficiently. It utilizes a mix of creatures like Scrapheap Scrounger, Toolcraft Exemplar, and Hazoret the Fervent, along with vehicles like Heart of Kiran and Aethersphere Harvester to maintain pressure on the opponent. Removal spells like Fatal Push and Unlicensed Disintegration help control the board and clear the way for your creatures to attack. The key strategy is to flood the board with threats and overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to recover."
