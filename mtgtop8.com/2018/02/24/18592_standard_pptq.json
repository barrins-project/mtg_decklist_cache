The goal is to stall the opponent's threats while setting up win conditions such as Approach of the Second Sun or Torment of Hailfire. Authority of the Consuls slows down aggressive decks, while Mastermind's Acquisition allows for flexibility by accessing sideboard cards. The deck also includes a mix of lands to ensure consistent mana sources. Overall, the strategy revolves around outlasting opponents and winning through powerful late-game spells."
