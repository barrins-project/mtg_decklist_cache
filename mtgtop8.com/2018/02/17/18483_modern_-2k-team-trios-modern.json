This allows the player to cast big threats like Karn Liberated, Ugin, the Spirit Dragon, and other powerful creatures such as Wurmcoil Engine and Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger. The deck also includes a variety of ways to search for and find the Tron lands, ensuring consistent access to mana and threats. Additionally, the deck includes removal and graveyard hate to disrupt opponents' strategies."
