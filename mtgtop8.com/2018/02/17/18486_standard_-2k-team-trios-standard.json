It utilizes cards like Bomat Courier and Scrapheap Scrounger for recurring threats and has a low land count to ensure a high curve. Removal spells like Unlicensed Disintegration, Lightning Strike, and Abrade help clear the way for your creatures to deal damage quickly. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and end the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
