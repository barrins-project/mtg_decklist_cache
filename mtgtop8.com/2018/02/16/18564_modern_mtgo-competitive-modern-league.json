The deck also includes protection spells like Vines of Vastwood and Blossoming Defense to ensure your infect creatures can get through to deal lethal damage. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, evasive infect creatures before they can mount a defense."

            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to utilize aggressive creatures like Death's Shadow and Gurmag Angler to put pressure on the opponent quickly, while also disrupting their game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Stubborn Denial. The deck also has access to removal spells such as Path to Exile and Dismember to deal with threats on the opponent's side of the board. The inclusion of Lingering Souls and Geist of Saint Traft provides additional threats and resilience to the deck's game plan. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the deck's multiple color requirements."
