The deck uses Liliana of the Veil as a powerful planeswalker and Smallpox as a way to further disrupt the opponent's resources. It aims to grind out a win through attrition and resource denial."

The inclusion of Aether Vial helps to cheat creatures into play at instant speed, while disruptive cards like Meddling Mage and Reflector Mage can disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck's mana base is built to support its multi-colored creatures, ensuring consistent and fast aggression."

It utilizes ramp spells like Explore and Search for Tomorrow to accelerate mana production, while Primeval Titan can quickly tutor for Valakut and trigger its ability. Prismatic Omen ensures that all lands count as Mountains, increasing the effectiveness of Scapeshift. The deck also includes removal and card draw spells like Lightning Bolt and Courser of Kruphix to control the game and dig for combo pieces."
