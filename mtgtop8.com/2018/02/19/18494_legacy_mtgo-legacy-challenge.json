With a combination of aggressive creatures like Reality Smasher and Endless One, supported by disruptive spells like Chalice of the Void and Warping Wail, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. The inclusion of utility lands like Karakas and Mishra's Factory helps to provide additional options and flexibility in different matchups. Overall, the deck is designed to be fast and disruptive, aiming to close out games quickly."
