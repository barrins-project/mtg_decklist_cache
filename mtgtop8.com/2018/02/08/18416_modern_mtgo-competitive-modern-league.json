By using cards like Farseek, Search for Tomorrow, and Hour of Promise to ramp, along with cards like Sakura-Tribe Elder and Wood Elves to accelerate land drops, the goal is to assemble the combo quickly and overwhelm the opponent with burst damage from Valakut triggers. Defensive cards like Lightning Bolt and Sweltering Suns provide removal and control options to protect the combo."
