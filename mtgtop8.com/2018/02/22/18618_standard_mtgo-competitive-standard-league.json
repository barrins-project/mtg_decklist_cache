The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering key spells, removing threatening creatures, and generating card advantage with cards like Search for Azcanta and Glimmer of Genius. The win condition of the deck is often through the powerful late-game threats like Torrential Gearhulk and The Scarab God, which can provide immense value and quickly close out the game."
