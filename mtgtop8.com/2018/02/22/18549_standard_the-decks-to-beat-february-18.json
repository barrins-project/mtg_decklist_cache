The deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total before they can stabilize, leveraging its low mana curve and powerful finishers like Rekindling Phoenix to maintain pressure. The inclusion of cards like Bomat Courier and Fanatical Firebrand also allows for additional reach and flexibility in combat situations."

It also includes powerful late-game threats such as Tetzimoc, Primal Death and Vraska, Relic Seeker to close out the game. The deck utilizes lands that provide additional utility, such as Arch of Orazca and Ifnir Deadlands, to gain incremental advantage over time. In addition, cards like Gift of Paradise and Arguel's Blood Fast help stabilize the deck's life total and provide card advantage. The overall goal is to control the game and outvalue the opponent until a win condition can be established."
