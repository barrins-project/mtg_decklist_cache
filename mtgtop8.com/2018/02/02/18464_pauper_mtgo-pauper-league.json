Supporting these creatures are efficient removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Journey to Nowhere. The deck's card advantage engine is fueled by Ichor Wellspring and Prophetic Prism, which can help maintain consistency in drawing threats. The deck also includes a slight token theme with Kuldotha Rebirth and Battle Screech to go wide and overwhelm opponents. The mana base includes a mix of colored lands to ensure consistent access to white and red spells."
