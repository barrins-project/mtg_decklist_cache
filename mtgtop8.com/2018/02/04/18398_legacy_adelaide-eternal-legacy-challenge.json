The mana base is optimized for consistency and speed, with a focus on playing threats early and protecting them with countermagic. Lilyana of the Veil is included for additional disruption and card advantage."

It also disrupts opponents' strategies with Blood Moon and Chalice of the Void, while having additional threats like Inferno Titan and Combustible Gearhulk for added versatility. The main goal is to overwhelm opponents with fast, high-impact plays."
