The deck also utilizes card draw and manipulation to find the right answers at the right time, as well as protection spells like Apostle's Blessing and Dispel to keep your threats safe. The inclusion of evasion spells like Slip Through Space and Temur Battle Rage helps to push through for lethal damage."
