            "notes": "This Rakdos Aggro deck focuses on aggressively attacking the opponent with efficient and resilient creatures like Rekindling Phoenix, Scrapheap Scrounger, and Hazoret the Fervent. It also runs a variety of burn spells like Lightning Strike, Magma Spray, and Unlicensed Disintegration to clear the way and deal direct damage to the opponent. Fanatical Firebrand, Earthshaker Khenra, and Ahn-Crop Crasher provide additional pressure and disruption, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. The deck aims to close out games quickly and decisively through a combination of creature aggression and burn spells."
