By casting Show and Tell, the player can put a big creature like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn or Griselbrand onto the battlefield, bypassing traditional casting costs. This combo-focused deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with massive threats early in the game, while also running necessary control elements like Force of Will and counterspells to protect the combo pieces."
