By utilizing efficient artifacts and mana acceleration, the deck aims to deploy threats like Arcbound Ravager, Steel Overseer, and Walking Ballista to apply pressure early in the game. The inclusion of disruptive cards like Chalice of the Void and Thorn of Amethyst helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Hangarback Walker and Vault Skirge provide resilience and additional threats. The deck aims to close out the game quickly before the opponent can stabilize."
