The deck also includes utility lands like Shefet Dunes and Scavenger Grounds to provide additional options in various situations.

The removal spells like Fatal Push and Walk the Plank help clear the way for your creatures to attack while also disrupting the opponent's game plan. Cards like Ruin Raider and Glint-Sleeve Siphoner help you draw more cards to keep the pressure on. The deck is designed to be aggressive and efficient, using your creatures and spells to control the battlefield and deal damage quickly."

Overall, the strategy is to outpace opponents and maintain pressure throughout the game."
