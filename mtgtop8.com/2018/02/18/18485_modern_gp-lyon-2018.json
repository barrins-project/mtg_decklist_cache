It utilizes counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to outvalue the opponent and protect its win conditions. The deck's win conditions come in the form of resilient threat like Celestial Colonnade and Gideon of the Trials, with some card advantage engines like Search for Azcanta and Sphinx's Revelation to maintain card advantage. By maintaining control of the game and denying the opponent's resources, the deck aims to outlast and outvalue the opponent to secure a victory."
