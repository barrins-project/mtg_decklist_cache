By applying constant pressure and dealing direct damage, this deck aims to end the game swiftly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Cards like Hazoret the Fervent and Earthshaker Khenra provide strong threats that can close out games, while burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock offer direct damage to either clear the way or finish off the opponent. The deck's overall strategy is to be fast, aggressive, and relentless."
