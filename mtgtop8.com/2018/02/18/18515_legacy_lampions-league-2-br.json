The deck utilizes cards like Infernal Tutor, Cabal Ritual, and Lion's Eye Diamond to generate mana, while also using card draw spells like Gitaxian Probe and Brainstorm to dig through the deck. The deck also includes disruption cards like Duress and Cabal Therapy to protect the combo. The goal is to win the game through a high storm count and overwhelming the opponent with a flurry of spells."
