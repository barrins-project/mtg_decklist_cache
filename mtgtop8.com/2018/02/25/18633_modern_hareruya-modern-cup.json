The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, answer threats, and then establish a dominant board presence to close out the game. By combining control elements with midrange threats, the deck can adapt to different situations and outvalue opponents in the late game. The mana base is carefully crafted to support the diverse range of spells and abilities in the deck."

The deck aims to maintain board presence and outvalue the opponent with card advantage from cards like Liliana of the Veil and Courser of Kruphix. The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana, the Last Hope to provide additional value and grind out wins against opponents. With a solid mana base and a mix of threats and answers, this aggressive Jund deck is designed to apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's game plan."
