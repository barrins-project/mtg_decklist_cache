The goal is to keep applying pressure and burn through the opponent's life total as fast as possible, while also utilizing creatures that can deal damage passively. In addition, the deck includes ways to draw extra cards to maintain a steady stream of burn spells and maximize damage output. The strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a barrage of direct damage spells and aggressive creatures."
