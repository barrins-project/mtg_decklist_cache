            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to utilize the Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle land card to deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent by ramping up to get multiple mountains on the field and then using cards like Scapeshift and Primeval Titan to trigger Valakut's ability. The deck focuses on quickly assembling the combo pieces and efficiently ramping up to reach the critical mass of mountains needed to win the game in a single turn. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy that requires careful resource management and timing to pull off successfully."
