By combining powerful creatures like Mirran Crusader and Wilt-Leaf Liege with disruptive cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Leonin Arbiter, the deck aims to apply pressure early and prevent the opponent from executing their game plan smoothly. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Path to Exile and Aether Vial provide additional removal and flexibility in deploying threats. Overall, the deck seeks to establish a strong board presence and maintain control of the game through aggression and disruption."
