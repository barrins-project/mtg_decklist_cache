River Heralds' Boon and Blossoming Defense help protect your key creatures, while Unsummon provides tempo advantage. Kumena, Tyrant of Orazca serves as a powerful late-game threat, while Watertrap Weaver provides additional disruption. The mana base of the deck is designed to ensure consistent access to all colors needed for optimal performance."
