With a mix of removal, hand disruption, and strong creatures, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently in a Modern 1 vs 1 format."

By cycling creatures like Street Wraith and Striped Riverwinder, players can fill their graveyard quickly and then cast Living End to bring all their creatures back onto the battlefield from the graveyard, potentially overwhelming their opponent. The inclusion of As Foretold allows for free casting of spells, helping to speed up the combo and take control of the game."
