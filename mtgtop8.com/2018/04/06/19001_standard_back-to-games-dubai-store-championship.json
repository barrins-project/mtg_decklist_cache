These tokens are then buffed and given additional abilities through Appeal / Authority and Sram's Expertise to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive attacks. Additional support comes from Aethersphere Harvester and Skysovereign, Consul Flagship to keep the pressure on the opponent. Hashep Oasis and Shefet Dunes provide ways to pump up the team, while Merfolk Branchwalker helps with card selection. Legion's Landing is included for additional token generation and mana ramping potential."
