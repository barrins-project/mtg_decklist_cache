The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor to provide additional card advantage and control. Overall, the deck seeks to control the game and win through incremental advantage."

By cycling these creatures, the player can fill up their graveyard and eventually cast Living End to return all of their creatures from the graveyard to the battlefield, potentially overwhelming their opponent with a board full of powerful creatures. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Fulminator Mage and Beast Within to deal with problematic permanents on the opponent's side of the battlefield."
