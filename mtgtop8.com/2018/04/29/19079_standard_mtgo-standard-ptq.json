The addition of cards like Blossoming Defense provides protection for key creatures, while the inclusion of vehicles such as Heart of Kiran and Skysovereign, Consul Flagship offer additional reach and evasion."

Using efficient removal spells like Vraska's Contempt and Fatal Push, the deck aims to maintain board control while building up a strong board presence. The inclusion of Verdurous Gearhulk and Rishkar, Peema Renegade further enhances the deck's ability to go wide and overwhelm the opponent."
