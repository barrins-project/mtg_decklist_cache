            "notes": "The deck focuses on leveraging the synergy between creatures with powerful enters-the-battlefield effects and mana dorks to accelerate the board state and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays. The key strategy involves using cards like Collected Company to quickly deploy threats like Spell Queller and Reflector Mage to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building up a board presence with creatures like Knight of the Reliquary and Voice of Resurgence. The deck also includes some utility lands like Ghost Quarter and Gavony Township to further enhance its versatility and resilience in combat."
