The deck aims to establish early dominance and control the game through a combination of disruption and aggression."

By using cards like Blood Moon, Magus of the Moon, and Chalice of the Void, the deck aims to capitalize on the opponent's inability to cast spells effectively. Additionally, cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Goblin Rabblemaster provide additional pressure and protection. The deck's aggressive strategy is complemented by powerful planeswalkers like Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Karn, Scion of Urza to maintain board presence and card advantage."

In addition, cards like Thoughtseize, Duress, and Pithing Needle are included to disrupt your opponent's game plan and protect your combo."

The deck aims to stabilize the game with cards like Supreme Verdict and Rest in Peace, while setting up win conditions with Luminarch Ascension and Helm of Obedience. By leveraging efficient answers and powerful threats, this deck seeks to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a slower paced, control-oriented game."
