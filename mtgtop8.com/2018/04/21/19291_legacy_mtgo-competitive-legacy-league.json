The use of Cephalid Coliseum and Faithless Looting helps with graveyard filling, while Cabal Therapy disrupts opponent's strategies. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with large creatures and tokens from the graveyard while managing resources like Mana Confluence and Lion's Eye Diamond effectively. It is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that requires careful planning and execution."

            "notes": "This deck revolves around the use of enchantments to generate mana and draw cards, allowing the player to cast powerful threats such as Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Doomwake Giant. The key strategy is to accelerate the game with cards like Utopia Sprawl and Wild Growth, while controlling the board with Elephant Grass and other removal enchantments. The combination of Enchantress's Presence and Argothian Enchantress allows for consistent card draw, ensuring the player can access their win conditions quickly and overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures."
