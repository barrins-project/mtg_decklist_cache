By using cards like Brainstorm, Ponder, and Preordain to dig for combo pieces, the deck aims to cheat these huge threats into play early in the game. The inclusion of counterspells like Spell Pierce and Force of Will helps protect the combo from disruption, while cards like Sneak Attack provide additional ways to put pressure on the opponent. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast, game-ending threats."
