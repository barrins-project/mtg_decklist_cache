The deck also utilizes versatile removal like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay to handle opponent's threats. The presence of planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Liliana, the Last Hope provides additional value and control elements. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while applying pressure to win the game quickly."
