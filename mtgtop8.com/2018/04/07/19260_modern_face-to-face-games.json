By protecting the creature with a Leyline of Sanctity and other auras like Spirit Mantle and Daybreak Coronet, it can quickly overwhelm the opponent with a large, evasive attacker. The deck also includes ways to search for the needed auras and lands to ensure consistency in the strategy. Overall, the key concept is to create an unstoppable, hexproof creature that can win the game quickly."
