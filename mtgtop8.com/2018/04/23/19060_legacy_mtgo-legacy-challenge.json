The deck includes cards like Crop Rotation, Sylvan Scrying, and Expedition Map to consistently find the combo pieces while utilizing mana acceleration with cards like Elvish Spirit Guide and Lotus Petal. The overall strategy is to quickly generate a 20/20 Marit Lage token by sacrificing Dark Depths, overwhelming the opponent."
