In addition, the inclusion of Hope of Ghirapur helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan while protecting key creatures. With a low land count, the deck aims to consistently apply pressure and win the game before the opponent can stabilize."

The key strategy is to utilize Vizier of Tumbling Sands and Faith of the Devoted, along with other cycling cards, to create a loop that allows the player to cycle through the deck multiple times in a turn, generating mana and triggering Faith of the Devoted's ability to drain the opponent's life. The deck aims to win through this combo and control the game with countermagic and removal spells."
