By ramping up mana with cards like Search for Tomorrow, Farseek, and Sakura-Tribe Elder, the deck aims to play and sacrifice enough lands to trigger Valakut's ability and deal significant damage to the opponent. Cards like Primeval Titan and Bloodbraid Elf provide additional ramp and value, while Lightning Bolt and Slagstorm act as removal and board control. Overall, the deck emphasizes a fast and explosive combo win condition."

The key focus is to quickly deploy creatures like Champion of the Parish, Thalia's Lieutenant, and Mantis Rider, supported by disruption from cards like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Meddling Mage. Aether Vial is used to cheat creatures into play and maintain board presence, while Cavern of Souls ensures that Human spells can't be countered. The deck aims to be proactive, applying pressure and disrupting the opponent's game plan."

With cards like Voice of Resurgence and Wall of Omens providing protection and card advantage, the deck aims to combo off with Felidar Guardian and Saheeli Rai for an infinite creature loop. The inclusion of Sun Titan adds another angle of attack, while disruptive cards like Reflector Mage and Magus of the Moon can help control the opponent's board state. The deck also has acceleration with Noble Hierarch and Birds of Paradise to quickly get the combo pieces out."
