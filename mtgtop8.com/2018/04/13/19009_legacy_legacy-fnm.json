The mana base is carefully constructed to support the control strategy, allowing for consistency and flexibility in responses to various threats."

By combining powerful hatebears like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Spirit of the Labyrinth with disruptive lands like Rishadan Port and Wasteland, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while applying pressure with efficient beaters like Serra Avenger and Flickerwisp. The Aether Vial allows for quick deployment of creatures, while cards like Recruiter of the Guard and Dire Fleet Daredevil provide additional utility and flexibility in different matchups. The deck's strategy revolves around taxing the opponent's plays while aggressively attacking to close out games quickly."

The deck includes various ways to search for the combo pieces, protect them from disruption, and disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Thoughtseize and Duress. The deck aims to win the game as fast as possible, using efficient and streamlined combo pieces to overwhelm the opponent."
