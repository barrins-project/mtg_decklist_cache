The deck also includes ways to disrupt opponents' strategies, such as using Ghost Quarter to destroy lands and Chalice of the Void to shut down spells of specific mana costs. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm opponents with fast, powerful threats while disrupting their game plan."

Shaman of the Pack provides additional reach and can finish off opponents when their life total is low. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a swarm of powerful Elves."
