The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a swarm of creatures and utilize cards like Galvanic Blast for removal and reach. The inclusion of cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum help accelerate mana production, while cards like Steel Overseer and Master of Etherium provide additional support and buffs to the artifact creatures. The deck is highly synergistic and aims to win the game through aggressive and efficient plays."
