It aims to assemble Urzatron lands to generate a large amount of mana to cast powerful spells like Rolling Thunder. The deck also utilizes card recursion with Mnemonic Wall and Ghostly Flicker to reuse key spells. Mulldrifter provides card advantage while Prophetic Prism helps fix mana. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue opponents through efficient removal, countermagic, and card advantage while ramping into powerful late-game threats."
