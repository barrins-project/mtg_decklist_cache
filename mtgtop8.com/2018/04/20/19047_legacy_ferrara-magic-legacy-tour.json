            "notes": "The deck focuses on playing low-cost aggressive creatures and burn spells to quickly deal damage to the opponent. It aims to win the game before the opponent can establish a strong board presence or gain significant life. The deck includes a mix of efficient creature threats like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, along with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike. Price of Progress serves as a powerful finisher, punishing opponents who rely heavily on non-basic lands. The deck prioritizes speed and direct damage to secure a swift victory."
