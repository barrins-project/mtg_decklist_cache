            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to steadily control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Thoughtseize, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Smallpox. Utilizing powerful Planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Gideon, Ally of Zendikar, the deck aims to establish dominance while generating incremental advantage with Lingering Souls and Bloodghast. The deck also includes removal spells like Fatal Push and Damnation to deal with threats, as well as card advantage engines like Sorin, Solemn Visitor and Smuggler's Copter. By maintaining a disruptive game plan, the deck aims to outgrind and outvalue the opponent for victory."
