The deck also aims to ramp up mana quickly to bring out the powerful finisher, Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, using cards like Through the Breach. The inclusion of Blood Moon can also disrupt the opponent's mana base, giving the deck an advantage.

The deck uses control elements like Oblivion Stone and Relic of Progenitus to disrupt the opponent's strategy while searching for the key pieces with Expedition Map, Sylvan Scrying, and Ancient Stirrings. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with big threats and control the game."

The Eldrazi Displacer serves as both a disruptive element and a win condition, allowing for versatile plays.
