The deck utilizes cards like Force of Will, Swords to Plowshares, and Counterbalance to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also generating card advantage with cards like Brainstorm and Ancestral Vision. The deck also includes win conditions such as Jace, the Mind Sculptor, Monastery Mentor, and Snapcaster Mage to close out the game once the opponent has been sufficiently controlled."

The deck also includes disruptive cards like Duress and Cabal Therapy to protect the combo from disruption. The goal is to cast a storm of spells in one turn, generating a lethal amount of storm count for Tendrils of Agony to finish off the opponent in one massive attack."
