The inclusion of planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Kolaghan's Command help provide additional value and versatility, making it a strong Aggro deck in the Modern format."

By quickly reducing the opponent's life total, the goal is to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize or mount a defense. The deck utilizes efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, along with powerful burn spells like Boros Charm and Lightning Bolt, to apply pressure and close out the game swiftly. The mana base is streamlined to ensure a fast and smooth curve for maximum aggression."

            "notes": "The main concept of the deck is to aggressively utilize discard mechanics to quickly fill the graveyard, allowing for efficient casting of powerful creatures like Hollow One, Gurmag Angler, and Flamewake Phoenix. The deck's strategy revolves around playing threats early and relentlessly attacking the opponent, leveraging cards like Goblin Lore, Burning Inquiry, and Faithless Looting to maintain card advantage and keep pressure on the opponent. Additionally, the deck includes burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lightning Axe for additional reach and removal options to clear the way for its aggressive creatures."
