Blood Moon is included as a disruption piece against multicolor decks, while Snapcaster Mage provides additional flexibility by allowing the player to reuse key spells from the graveyard. The mana base is optimized to support the deck's color requirements."

By utilizing cards like Leonin Arbiter and Ghost Quarter to restrict the opponent's mana base, along with Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Phyrexian Revoker to slow down spells and abilities, the deck can control the tempo of the game. Meanwhile, cards like Blade Splicer and Restoration Angel provide powerful threats to close out the game quickly. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt and aggro down opponents efficiently in a Modern 1 vs 1 matchup."
