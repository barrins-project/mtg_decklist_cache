By utilizing efficient creatures like Delver of Secrets, Ninja of the Deep Hours, and Spellstutter Sprite, combined with disruption spells like Counterspell and Vapor Snag, the deck aims to apply constant pressure while also controlling the opponent's board. Drawing cards with Gitaxian Probe, Preordain, and Ponder helps to maintain card advantage and keep the aggression going. With a primarily Island-based mana base, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent and secure a victory."
