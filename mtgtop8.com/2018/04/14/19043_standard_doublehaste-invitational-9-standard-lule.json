The goal is to quickly fill the graveyard with creatures using Minister of Inquiries and Champion of Wits, then bring them back to the battlefield with Refurbish. Search for Azcanta helps to dig through the deck for key cards, while Vizier of Many Faces can copy powerful creatures for added value. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outcontrol opponents to secure victory."
