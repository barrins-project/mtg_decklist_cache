The deck includes burn spells like Lightning Strike and Shock to control the board and deal direct damage. It also utilizes cards like Bomat Courier and Hazoret the Fervent to maintain card advantage and keep the pressure on. Overall, the deck aims to establish an early advantage and quickly close out the game."
