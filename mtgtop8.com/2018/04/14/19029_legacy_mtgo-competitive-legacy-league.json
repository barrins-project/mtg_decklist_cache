With a suite of efficient removal in Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay, along with powerful countermagic in Force of Will and Daze, this deck aims to control the game and press the advantage. By utilizing a mana base with a mix of dual lands and fetch lands, it can consistently cast its spells while disrupting the opponent's mana with Wasteland."
