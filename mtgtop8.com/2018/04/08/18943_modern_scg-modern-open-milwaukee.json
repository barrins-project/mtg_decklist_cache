The deck also includes some midrange threats like Batterskull and Thragtusk to provide stability in longer games. The goal is to quickly finish off the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on using cycling creatures like Monstrous Carabid and Street Wraith to quickly fill up the graveyard, then casting Living End to bring them back into play for a powerful board wipe and potential win condition. The deck also includes cards like Fulminator Mage to disrupt opponents' mana bases and Faerie Macabre to exile key cards from opponents' graveyards. The goal is to set up a strong board presence while disrupting opponents' strategies, leading to a decisive victory through overwhelming force."

The inclusion of Blood Moon can disrupt opponent's mana bases, while Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides card advantage and control. Snapcaster Mage allows for spells to be recast from the graveyard, and Lightning Bolt provides additional removal. The deck aims to stall the game and disrupt the opponent's strategy while setting up its own win condition."
