The key strategy is to cheat big threats like Griselbrand and Elesh Norn into play early in the game, overwhelming the opponent before they can respond. The deck also utilizes disruptive elements such as Chancellor of the Annex and Thoughtseize to protect the combo and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The goal is to win the game quickly through explosive plays and efficient use of resources."
