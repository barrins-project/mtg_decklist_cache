The deck includes multiple ways to search for and assemble these pieces such as Crop Rotation, Sylvan Scrying, and Expedition Map. Additionally, the deck includes disruption elements like Thoughtseize and Duress to protect the combo. The deck also includes additional protection with cards like Sylvan Safekeeper and Pithing Needle. Overall, the key strategy is to assemble the Dark Depths combo as quickly and efficiently as possible to overwhelm the opponent."
