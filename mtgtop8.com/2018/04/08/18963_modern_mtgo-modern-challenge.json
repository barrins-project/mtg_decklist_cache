By utilizing cards like Aether Vial to cheat creatures into play and Thalia's Lieutenant to pump up all of your Humans, you can quickly build a strong board presence. Cards like Reflector Mage and Meddling Mage disrupt your opponent's game plan while cards like Mantis Rider and Champion of the Parish deal significant damage. The flexibility provided by lands like Unclaimed Territory and Cavern of Souls allow for smooth mana fixing and support the Human tribal theme."
