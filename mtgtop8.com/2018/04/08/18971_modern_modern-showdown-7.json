The key strategy is to utilize cards like Ornithopter and Vault Skirge alongside Cranial Plating and Arcbound Ravager to create powerful attacking threats. Steel Overseer and Signal Pest help to build up a strong board presence, while Galvanic Blast provides direct damage to control the board. The deck relies on mana acceleration from Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum to quickly establish a threatening board state. The inclusion of Etched Champion provides protection against removal spells and ensures continued pressure on opponents."

The deck also includes cards like Fulminator Mage and Beast Within to disrupt the opponent's strategy and control the battlefield. The use of cascade spells like Demonic Dread and Violent Outburst helps to consistently trigger Living End and keep the combo going. Ultimately, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a board full of powerful creatures."

            "notes": "This deck relies on assembling specific creature combos to generate powerful and synergistic effects. By using cards like Devoted Druid and Vizier of Remedies, along with tutors like Collected Company and Chord of Calling, the deck can quickly find and play key pieces such as Kitchen Finks for infinite life gain or Walking Ballista for infinite damage. The toolbox nature of the deck allows for flexibility in finding answers to different situations, while also maintaining a strong aggressive presence on the battlefield."
