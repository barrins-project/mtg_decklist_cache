The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, while cards like Spell Pierce and Dismember provide additional disruption and removal options."

It also utilizes cards like Bloodghast and Street Wraith to continually apply pressure on the opponent. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast, explosive plays while also utilizing disruptive cards like Collective Brutality to control the pace of the game. The key strategy is to quickly establish a threatening board presence and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
