By utilizing cards like Cranial Plating, Mox Opal, and Arcbound Ravager, the deck can quickly build a large board presence and deal a lot of damage. Signal Pest and Steel Overseer help to pump up creatures and make them more threatening, while The Antiquities War can provide a strong finisher. The deck aims to win the game quickly by attacking relentlessly and putting pressure on the opponent from the very start."

The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil to control the board and grind out incremental advantages. Overall, the key concept is to apply early pressure and disrupt the opponent's strategy to secure a quick victory."
