It also utilizes card draw and life gain to outvalue the opponent in the late game. The mana base is designed to support the deck's control elements, with Field of Ruin for land destruction and consistent access to both Swamps and Islands. By controlling the pace of the game and outlasting the opponent, this deck aims to emerge victorious in 1 vs 1 matches."
