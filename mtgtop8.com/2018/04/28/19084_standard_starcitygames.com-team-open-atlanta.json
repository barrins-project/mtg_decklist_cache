The deck makes use of cards like Settle the Wreckage, Fumigate, Seal Away, and Cast Out to deal with the opponent's creatures. It also includes counterspells like Negate, Essence Scatter, and Disallow to counter key spells. Cards like Glimmer of Genius and Search for Azcanta provide card selection and card advantage. The deck's win condition is the combination of Teferi, Hero of Dominaria's card advantage and Torrential Gearhulk's flash and recursion abilities."

Blossoming Defense and Seal Away provide protection and removal, while Walking Ballista and Rishkar, Peema Renegade offer additional utility. The deck excels at overwhelming opponents with aggressive plays while maintaining a strong board presence, ultimately aiming to close out the game with powerful flying threats like Angel of Sanctions and Lyra Dawnbringer."
