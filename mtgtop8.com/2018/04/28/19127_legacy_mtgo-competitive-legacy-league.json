By utilizing cards such as Natural Order and Green Sun's Zenith, the deck aims to quickly tutor for powerful creatures like Craterhoof Behemoth to overrun the opponent in a single turn. Glimpse of Nature allows for extra card draw to help fuel the combo engine, creating a fast and explosive win condition."
