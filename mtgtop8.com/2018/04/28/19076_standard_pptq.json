By playing a mix of removal spells, creature pumps, and token generators, the deck aims to control the board and pressure the opponent's life total. The inclusion of Anointed Procession and Anointer Priest amplifies the token-generating ability of the deck, while Champion of Wits and Vizier of the Anointed provide card advantage. By combining these elements, the Azorius Aggro deck aims to quickly build a threatening board presence and secure victory."
