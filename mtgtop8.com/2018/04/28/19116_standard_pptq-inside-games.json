The deck focuses on surviving the early game with defensive cards like Seal Away and Settle the Wreckage, then quickly ramping up mana to cast the win condition, Approach of the Second Sun. Teferi, Hero of Dominaria provides card advantage and further control, while Thaumatic Compass helps find lands and transform into a strong defensive tool. This deck excels at outlasting opponents and winning through a slow, methodical approach."
