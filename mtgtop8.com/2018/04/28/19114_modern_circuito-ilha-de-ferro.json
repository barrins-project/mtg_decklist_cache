Aether Vial allows for instant speed creature deployment, while Spreading Seas can disrupt opponent's mana base. The deck is supported by tribal synergies like Merrow Reejerey and Master of the Pearl Trident, and benefits from the protection provided by Kira, Great Glass-Spinner and Kopala, Warden of Waves."
