The inclusion of planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and removal spells like Terminate and Abrupt Decay adds further versatility and resilience to the deck's game plan. Overall, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and disruption."

By utilizing cards that allow for quick card draw and graveyard play such as Faithless Looting and Insolent Neonate, the deck aims to consistently play powerful threats early in the game. The inclusion of cards like Reckless Bushwhacker and Burning-Tree Emissary also allows for explosive turns that can overwhelm opponents. The deck aims to apply constant pressure and force opponents to react quickly to its threats."
