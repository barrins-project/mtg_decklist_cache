By enchanting your creature with a variety of auras, you can boost its power and toughness while giving it hexproof and other protections. This allows you to efficiently deal damage to your opponent while keeping your own creature safe from removal spells. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast, evasive threat that is difficult to deal with, ultimately leading to victory through aggressive plays and efficient combat strategies."
