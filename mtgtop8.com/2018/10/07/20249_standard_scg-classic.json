It utilizes a combination of counterspells like Syncopate and Sinister Sabotage, removal spells like Vraska's Contempt and Cast Down, and card draw with Chemister's Insight and Search for Azcanta. The win condition comes from the powerful planeswalker Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and the indestructible Chromium, the Mutable. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while slowly building up to a dominant position on the battlefield."

It capitalizes on generating token creatures and buffing them with cards like History of Benalia and Venerated Loxodon. The inclusion of cards like March of the Multitudes and Emmara, Soul of the Accord help to create a wide board presence. Additionally, cards like Shalai, Voice of Plenty and Trostani Discordant provide protection and lifegain to sustain the aggro strategy. Conclave Tribunal and Knight of Autumn serve as versatile removal and disruption cards to control the board."
