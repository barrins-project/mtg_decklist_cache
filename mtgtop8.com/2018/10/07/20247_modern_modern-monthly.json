The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent's life total through direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Lightning Helix, while creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear chip in with additional damage. Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel punish opponents for casting spells while Ahn-Crop Crasher and Earthshaker Khenra help to push damage through blockers. The deck's mana base ensures consistent access to the necessary colors for spells."
