The deck also emphasizes removal, with cards like Assassin's Trophy, Ravenous Chupacabra, and Cast Down to eliminate the opponent's threats. The planeswalkers Vraska, Relic Seeker and Vraska, Golgari Queen provide additional utility and card advantage."

The strategy also involves using cards like Venerated Loxodon and Benalish Marshal to buff the creatures and push for damage. The inclusion of cards like Conclave Tribunal and Shalai, Voice of Plenty provides removal and protection for the creatures, allowing the deck to maintain board presence and pressure the opponent."
