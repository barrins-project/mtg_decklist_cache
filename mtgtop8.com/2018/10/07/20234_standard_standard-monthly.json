            "notes": "This deck focuses on quickly overwhelming the opponent with aggressive red creatures and burn spells. It aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently, taking advantage of cards like Runaway Steam-Kin to ramp up its mana and play multiple threats in a single turn. The creatures in the deck are difficult to deal with and can quickly take control of the board, while the burn spells provide extra reach to finish off the opponent. The deck's curve is low, allowing for fast starts and constant pressure on the opponent."
