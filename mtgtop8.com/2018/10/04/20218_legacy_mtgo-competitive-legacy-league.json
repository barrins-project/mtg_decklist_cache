            "notes": "This deck focuses on using artifacts to quickly control the board and overwhelm the opponent with powerful creatures and disruption. The key strategy is to deploy artifacts like Chalice of the Void and Karn, Scion of Urza to disrupt the opponent's plans while using cards like The Antiquities War and Baleful Strix to generate advantage and pressure the opponent. The deck also includes cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Engineered Explosives to further control the board and protect against aggressive strategies. With a mix of card advantage and disruptive elements, this deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents in Legacy 1 vs 1 matchups."
