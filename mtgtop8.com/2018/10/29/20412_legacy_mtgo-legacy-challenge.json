Utilizing cards like Lion's Eye Diamond and Cabal Therapy for additional resources and disruption, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures and tokens generated from the graveyard. The key strategy is to dredge with efficiency and precision to set up explosive turns and ultimately outpace and outvalue the opponent."

By dredging through the deck, the player can bring back powerful creatures like Ichorid and Prized Amalgam from the graveyard and overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures. Cards like Cabal Therapy and Dread Return help disrupt the opponent's strategy and set up powerful combos to win the game. The goal is to quickly establish a dominant board presence and outpace the opponent for a swift victory."
