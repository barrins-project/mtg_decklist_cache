The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy by removing their threats and countering their key spells, while also generating card advantage through cards like Forbidden Alchemy and Mulldrifter. Additionally, the deck utilizes powerful finishers such as Gurmag Angler and Chainer's Edict to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been depleted. The combination of removal, counter magic, and card advantage makes this deck a potent force in the Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
