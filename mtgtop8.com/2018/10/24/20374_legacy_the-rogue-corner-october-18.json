It also disrupts the opponent's game plan with cards like Wasteland, Sinkhole, and Stifle to control the board and prevent the opponent from stabilizing. The deck also has a suite of countermagic and removal spells, such as Force of Will, Daze, and Diabolic Edict, to protect its creatures and deal with threats. Overall, the deck's main strategy is to be proactive, disruptive, and resilient."
