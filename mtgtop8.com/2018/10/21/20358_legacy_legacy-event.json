The deck utilizes a mix of removal spells like Fatal Push and Diabolic Edict, along with card advantage engines like Baleful Strix and Snapcaster Mage. The mana base is carefully constructed to support the multicolored spells, allowing the player to smoothly transition from disrupting the opponent to applying pressure and closing out the game with efficient threats like Gurmag Angler and Lightning Bolt."

By using cards like Chalice of the Void, Thought-Knot Seer, and Force of Will to control the game, it aims to protect its key creatures like True-Name Nemesis and Stoneforge Mystic to generate card advantage and apply pressure. The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Karn, Scion of Urza to further control the board and outvalue the opponent. Additionally, it has access to versatile mana sources like City of Traitors and Ancient Tomb to quickly deploy its threats."
