By using cards like Baral, Chief of Compliance and Goblin Electromancer to reduce the cost of spells, the deck aims to cast multiple copies of Grape shot or Empty the Warrens to finish off the opponent in one turn. Gifts Ungiven is used to search for key combo pieces, while Past in Flames allows the player to recast spells from the graveyard. The deck is designed to win in a single explosive turn."
