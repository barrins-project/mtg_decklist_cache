The cards in the deck provide a mix of creature removal, hand disruption, and card draw to outvalue the opponent over time. The win condition typically involves playing powerful finishers like Doom Whisperer or Nightveil Predator to secure the game. By controlling the board and cards in play, this deck aims to outlast and outplay the opponent in a game of attrition."
