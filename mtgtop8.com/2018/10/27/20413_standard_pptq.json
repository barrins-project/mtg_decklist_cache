It focuses on establishing a strong board presence early on with cards like Adanto Vanguard and History of Benalia, while using powerful angels like Lyra Dawnbringer and Resplendent Angel to close out the game. Removal spells like Lightning Strike and Deafening Clarion help to clear the way for attacks, while cards like Shalai, Voice of Plenty provide protection for your creatures. Overall, the deck aims to be fast, efficient, and relentless in its pursuit of victory."
