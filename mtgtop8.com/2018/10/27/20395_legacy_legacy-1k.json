The deck utilizes cards like Entomb and Faithless Looting to fill the graveyard, while also running disruption in the form of Thoughtseize and Chancellor of the Annex to protect the combo. The goal is to assemble the combo pieces as quickly as possible and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats before they have a chance to respond."
