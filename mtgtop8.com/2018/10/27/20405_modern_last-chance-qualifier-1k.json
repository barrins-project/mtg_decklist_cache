Eidolon of the Great Revel punishes opponents for casting spells, while Searing Blaze provides removal and additional damage.

            "notes": "This deck focuses on playing efficient and aggressive Spirit creatures to control the board and pressure the opponent. By utilizing creatures with flash and disruptive abilities, along with the support of Aether Vial, the deck aims to maintain tempo and outvalue the opponent. The inclusion of removal spells and disruptive creatures like Spell Queller further enhances the deck's ability to disrupt opposing strategies while continuing to apply pressure. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and resilient creature base while disrupting their game plan."
