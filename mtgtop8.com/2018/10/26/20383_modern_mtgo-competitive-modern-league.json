It utilizes a combination of disruptive spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize to control the opponent's hand while also having removal spells like Fatal Push and Dismember to deal with threats. The deck also has the ability to quickly search for key cards with Traverse the Ulvenwald and generate card advantage with Mishra's Bauble and Kolaghan's Command. It aims to finish the game quickly and efficiently by overwhelming the opponent with strong creatures and disruptive spells."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on assembling a powerful combo using cards like Krark-Clan Ironworks, Scrap Trawler, and Myr Retriever to generate a large amount of mana and card advantage. It aims to quickly cycle through its deck using cards like Ancient Stirrings and Ichor Wellspring while also controlling the board with Engineered Explosives. The key strategy is to efficiently loop artifacts to generate mana and draw cards, eventually setting up a win condition through sacrificing artifacts and dealing direct damage with Pyrite Spellbomb or gaining value from sacrificing artifacts with Spine of Ish Sah."
