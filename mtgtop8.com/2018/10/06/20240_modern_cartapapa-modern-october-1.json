It disrupts opponents with cards like Blood Moon and Relic of Progenitus while managing the board with removal spells such as Skred and Anger of the Gods. The deck aims to outvalue opponents with efficient threats like Stormbreath Dragon and Pia and Kiran Nalaar, while also maintaining card advantage and mana acceleration with cards like Mind Stone and Scrying Sheets."
