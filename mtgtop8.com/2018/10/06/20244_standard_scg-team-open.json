This deck utilizes a combination of disruptive creatures like Ravenous Chupacabra and Deathgorge Scavenger, along with removal spells like Cast Down and Assassin's Trophy, to stay ahead and maintain pressure. The inclusion of cards like Vraska, Relic Seeker and Doom Whisperer provide additional threats and ways to close out the game. The mana base is optimized for consistent casting of spells and creatures."
