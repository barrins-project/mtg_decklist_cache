The key strategy is to efficiently search for lands and combo pieces while controlling the board with removal and sweepers until the combo can be assembled and executed for a game-winning finish. This deck is designed to quickly overwhelm opponents with its powerful combo potential and synergy between cards to create a winning board state."
