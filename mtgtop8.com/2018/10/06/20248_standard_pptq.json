By buffing creatures with Curious Obsession and Metamorphic Alteration, and countering opponent's spells with Wizard's Retort and Spell Pierce, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly and efficiently. Tempest Djinn serves as a powerful finisher, while Nightveil Sprite and Merfolk Trickster provide additional utility and disruption. Overall, this deck aims to control the board and tempo of the game while pressuring the opponent with a steady stream of threats."
