Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Thalia's Lieutenant provide support to the aggro strategy by slowing down the opponent and buffing the team, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. This deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and relentless assault."

The deck focuses on recurring artifacts from the graveyard and generating card advantage with cards like Scrap Trawler and Ichor Wellspring. The deck also utilizes various ways to draw cards and generate colored mana to cast spells effectively.
