Cards like Collected Company and Chord of Calling help to search for and assemble the necessary creatures for the combo, while cards like Kitchen Finks provide resilience and life gain."

It aims to pressure the opponent early with aggressive creatures like Tarmogoyf and Bloodbraid Elf, backed up by powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil. The deck's mana base is built to support its multicolor spells, allowing it to consistently cast its key cards and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to be proactive and disruptive, overwhelming the opponent before they can establish their own game plan."
