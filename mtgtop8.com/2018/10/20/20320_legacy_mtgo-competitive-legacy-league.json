It aims to rush out these threats early in the game, overwhelming the opponent with their sheer power and size. The deck also includes various card selection and protection spells to ensure that the combo can be executed smoothly and efficiently. The strategy relies on speed and explosiveness to win the game before the opponent has a chance to set up their own game plan."

Using cards like Eldrazi Temple and Eye of Ugin, the deck can quickly cast large threats like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Chalice of the Void is used to shut down opposing strategies, while cards like Endbringer provide additional utility. The goal of the deck is to overwhelm opponents with efficient creatures and disrupt their game plan, ultimately leading to a quick victory."
