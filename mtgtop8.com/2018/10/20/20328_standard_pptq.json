            "notes": "This red Aggro deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy. By playing low-cost creatures like Goblin Instigator and Skirk Prospector, along with powerful support cards like Goblin Warchief and Legion Warboss, this deck can quickly build a strong board presence. Cards like Runaway Steam-Kin and Experimental Frenzy provide extra card advantage and mana acceleration, allowing the player to keep up the pressure. With cards like Goblin Chainwhirler and Siege-Gang Commander for additional removal and damage, this deck is designed to win the game quickly and decisively."
