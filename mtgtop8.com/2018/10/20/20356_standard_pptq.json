By quickly building a wide board presence, the deck can overwhelm the opponent with powerful cards like Venerated Loxodon and March of the Multitudes. The inclusion of Ajani, Adversary of Tyrants and Trostani Discordant provide additional value and support for the aggressive game plan, making it difficult for the opponent to stabilize. Overall, the deck aims to pressure the opponent and close out the game quickly before the opponent can establish their own game plan."
