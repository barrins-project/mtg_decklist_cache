Bring to Light is used to tutor for key cards, while Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional card advantage and utility. The deck also includes some removal spells like Maelstrom Pulse and Damnation for board control."

By casting cards like Creeping Chill and Conflagrate from your graveyard, along with recurring creatures like Prized Amalgam and Bloodghast, you can overwhelm your opponent with a powerful combo. Utilizing cards like Stinkweed Imp and Narcomoeba to further fuel your graveyard and using Life from the Loam to keep your engine going, this deck focuses on utilizing the graveyard as a source of power."
