The key strategy is to use cards like Ghostly Flicker and Mnemonic Wall to repeatedly flicker creatures like Mulldrifter and Sea Gate Oracle, allowing you to draw more cards, gain life, and control the board. The deck also includes control elements like Negate to disrupt your opponent's plans. Sunscape Familiar reduces the cost of your spells, helping you to establish a dominant position on the battlefield. Overall, the deck focuses on generating card advantage and controlling the game through its flickering abilities."
