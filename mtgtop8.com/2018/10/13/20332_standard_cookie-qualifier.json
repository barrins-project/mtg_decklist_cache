It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating card advantage with Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Chemister's Insight. The deck also has a few win conditions in Dream Eater and Vraska's Contempt to close out the game. Field of Ruin is included to deal with troublesome lands, while Moment of Craving and Ritual of Soot help with early game defense. The deck's goal is to grind out the opponent and win through incremental advantages."
