The goal is to survive the early game with removal spells like Cast Down and Ritual of Soot, while countering key threats with Sinister Sabotage and Syncopate. Card advantage is gained through Chemister's Insight and Search for Azcanta, allowing the deck to outvalue the opponent and secure victory in the late game."
