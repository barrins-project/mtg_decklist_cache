By utilizing mana acceleration from cards like Simian Spirit Guide and Ancient Tomb, the deck can play threats like Thought-Knot Seer and Reality Smasher ahead of schedule. Chalice of the Void can shut down opposing strategies while cards like Eye of Ugin and Eldrazi Temple provide additional mana efficiency. With a mix of disruptive creatures and efficient beaters, the deck aims to close out games quickly through aggressive plays and overwhelming board presence."
