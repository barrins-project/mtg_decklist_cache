It aims to control the board early on with removal spells like Shock and Lava Coil, while also fueling the graveyard with spells like Radical Idea and Opt to bring back powerful threats like Arclight Phoenix and Crackling Drake. The deck utilizes cards that allow for card draw and filtering, such as Chart a Course and Discovery / Dispersal, to maintain a steady stream of threats and answers, enabling it to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of aggressive plays."
