The deck includes plenty of card draw and removal to keep up the pressure and maintain board control. By efficiently using instants and sorceries, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and consistently to win the game before the opponent can stabilize. The synergy between spells, creatures, and mana acceleration is crucial for its success."
