By using cards like Thoughtseize, Inquisition of Kozilek, and Wrench Mind, the deck aims to control the game by stripping away the opponent's resources and forcing them to discard cards. Ensnaring Bridge and Smallpox also contribute to controlling the board and limiting the opponent's options. The ultimate goal is to grind out a win by attrition and prevent the opponent from making plays."

It also includes removal spells and board wipes to control the game until the combo is assembled. The main win condition is using Primeval Titan to tutor for Valakut and mountains, ensuring a devastating combo can be activated. The deck aims to win the game within a few turns by overwhelming the opponent with direct damage from Valakut triggers."
