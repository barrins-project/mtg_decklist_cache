By efficiently ramping up mana with Llanowar Elves and utilizing cards like Wildgrowth Walker and Jadelight Ranger for card advantage and board presence, the deck aims to maintain pressure and control the game. With removal spells like Assassin's Trophy and creature removal like Ravenous Chupacabra, the deck can handle threats while continuing to push for damage. The inclusion of Vraska, Relic Seeker and Find / Finality adds versatility and additional win conditions."
