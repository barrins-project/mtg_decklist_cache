The deck also includes disruption spells like Force of Will and Daze to protect the combo. The mana base is focused on providing access to both green and blue mana, with Inkmoth Nexus serving as an alternative win condition. The deck aims to win as quickly as possible before the opponent can set up their own game plan."

The deck aims to control the game with cards like Force of Will and Counterspell, while also utilizing cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to provide additional value and card advantage. The goal is to slow down the opponent's game plan and eventually win the game with powerful finishers like Entreat the Angels or Back to Basics."
