This mana is then used to play powerful colorless threats such as Wurmcoil Engine, Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. The deck also utilizes control elements like Oblivion Stone and Karn Liberated to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain board control. Overall, the deck aims to control the game until it can establish a dominant board presence and win the game."
