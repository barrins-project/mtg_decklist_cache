The deck's aggressive strategy is further supported by cards like Lightning Strike and Shock, providing direct damage to close out games quickly."

By utilizing a mix of counterspells, removal spells, and hand disruption, the deck aims to control the game and slow down the opponent's strategy. Cards like Thought Erasure, Vraska's Contempt, and Thief of Sanity provide valuable card advantage, while creatures like Nicol Bolas, the Ravager and Doom Whisperer offer powerful threats. Lazav, the Multifarious and Hostage Taker provide additional versatility and ways to disrupt the opponent's plans. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent through careful resource management and controlling the game state."
