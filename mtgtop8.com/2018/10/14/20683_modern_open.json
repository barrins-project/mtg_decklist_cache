The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while generating card advantage through cards like Snapcaster Mage and Search for Azcanta. It utilizes a mix of burn spells, counterspells, and efficient removal to maintain board control. Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Jace, the Mind Sculptor provide card advantage and powerful abilities to help seal the game. The deck also includes land destruction to keep the opponent off balance and prevent them from developing their board."
