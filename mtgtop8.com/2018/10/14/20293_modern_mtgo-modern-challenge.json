It includes a mix of efficient creatures like Steel Leaf Champion and Strangleroot Geist, along with powerful finishers like Ghalta, Primal Hunger. The deck also utilizes Eldritch Evolution to tutor for key creatures and Magus of the Moon to disrupt opponents' mana bases. Overall, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and quickly close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
