The deck also includes utility cards like Wirewood Symbiote and Reclamation Sage to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with its strong board presence and combo potential."

By using cards such as Lotus Petal and Dark Ritual, the deck aims to reanimate these creatures ahead of schedule, overwhelming the opponent with powerful threats. The inclusion of cards like Unmask and Thoughtseize also allows for disruption of the opponent's game plan while the deck focuses on reanimating and quickly closing out the game with large, impactful creatures."
