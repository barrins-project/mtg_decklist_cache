Blood Moon is also used to disrupt opponent's mana base and slow down their development, giving the deck more time to establish control."

It also includes ways to recur key pieces like Scrap Trawler and Buried Ruin. The deck aims to quickly assemble its combo pieces while controlling the board with countermagic and removal spells. It incorporates card selection and ramping with Ancient Stirrings and Mox Opal to find and cast its combo pieces efficiently."
