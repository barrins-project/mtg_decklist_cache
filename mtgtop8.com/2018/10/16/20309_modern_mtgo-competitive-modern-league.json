By utilizing disruptive creatures like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter to hinder the opponent's game plan, while also having evasion and tempo plays with Mantis Rider and Reflector Mage, this deck aims to maintain pressure and control the board throughout the game. The deck's mana base is optimized for consistency and speed, allowing for explosive starts and smooth gameplay."
