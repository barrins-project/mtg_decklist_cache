This graveyard synergy allows for explosive plays, overwhelming the opponent with tokens from Bridge from Below and combo potential with Lion's Eye Diamond. With efficient mana sources like Mana Confluence and Cephalid Coliseum, the deck aims to set up powerful plays and win the game through graveyard recursion and overwhelming board presence."

The win condition is primarily through creating Angel tokens with Entreat the Angels or out-valuing the opponent with card advantage from cards like Snapcaster Mage and Jace, the Mind Sculptor."

Cards like Chalice of the Void and Trinisphere disrupt opponents' strategies, while Thought-Knot Seer and Walking Ballista provide disruption and removal. The deck aims to overwhelm opponents with efficient creatures like Matter Reshaper and Endbringer, eventually closing out the game with powerful finishers like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger and Kozilek, the Great Distortion. The deck's goal is to apply pressure and quickly close out the game with its high-impact threats."

The deck also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana of the Veil to generate additional card advantage and control the board. In addition, the deck includes versatile threats like Snapcaster Mage and True-Name Nemesis to close out the game."
