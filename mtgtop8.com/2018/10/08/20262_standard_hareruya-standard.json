The key strategy is to establish a strong board presence early on with cards like Adanto Vanguard and Boros Challenger, then pump up your creatures with powerful anthem effects from cards like Lyra Dawnbringer and Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice. Additionally, cards like Tajic, Legion's Edge and Shalai, Voice of Plenty provide protection for your creatures and grant evasion. The deck also includes removal spells like Deafening Clarion to help clear the way for your aggressive creatures."
