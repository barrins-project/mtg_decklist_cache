The deck also includes cards like Bloodbraid Elf and Renegade Rallier for additional value and consistency in executing the combo.

The deck is focused on controlling the board and stabilizing until it can assemble the combo of Scapeshift and Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle to deal lethal damage to the opponent in one explosive turn. It also includes cards like Bring to Light and Cryptic Command to provide flexibility and additional control options."
