This allows the player to deal lethal damage with Tendrils of Agony or generate a large amount of card advantage with cards like Ad Nauseam or Past in Flames. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Cabal Therapy and Duress to disrupt the opponent's game plan and protect the combo. The deck aims to win the game quickly and efficiently through its powerful storm-based strategy."
