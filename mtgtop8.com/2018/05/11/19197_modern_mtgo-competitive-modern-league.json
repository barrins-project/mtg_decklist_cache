It uses cards like Possibility Storm, Blood Moon, and Spreading Seas to disrupt the opponent's plans while also controlling the board with counterspells like Remand and Cryptic Command. The deck also includes win conditions like Emrakul, the Aeons Torn and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to close out the game once the opponent's resources have been exhausted. The deck aims to dictate the flow of the game and emerge victorious through careful planning and execution."

            "notes": "The main idea of this deck is to quickly play large creatures like Hollow One and Flamewake Phoenix by discarding cards and utilizing cards like Goblin Lore and Burning Inquiry. It also utilizes cards like Street Wraith and Bloodghast to put pressure on the opponent and overwhelm them with a fast and aggressive strategy. The deck aims to quickly fill up the graveyard and take advantage of graveyard synergies with cards like Gurmag Angler and Bloodghast while dealing direct damage with cards like Lightning Bolt and Flamewake Phoenix."
