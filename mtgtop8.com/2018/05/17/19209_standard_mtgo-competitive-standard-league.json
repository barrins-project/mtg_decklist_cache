By combining cheap spells like Shock, Lightning Strike, and Wizard's Lightning with creatures like Ghitu Lavarunner and Soul-Scar Mage, this deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Additionally, the inclusion of Adeliz, the Cinder Wind and Riddleform provides additional power and evasion.

The Scarab God and Torrential Gearhulk provide a strong late-game presence and can generate card advantage. Search for Azcanta helps filter through the deck and Liliana, Death's Majesty can bring back key creatures from the graveyard. The deck aims to outvalue the opponent and secure a win through attrition."
