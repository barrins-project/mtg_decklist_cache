This is achieved through low-cost creatures like Satyr Hoplite and Akroan Crusader, as well as pump spells like Mutagenic Growth and Titan's Strength to boost their power. The inclusion of cards like Assault Strobe and Temur Battle Rage allows for surprise burst damage, while Lightning Bolt provides some additional removal. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with quick, explosive attacks before they have a chance to stabilize."
