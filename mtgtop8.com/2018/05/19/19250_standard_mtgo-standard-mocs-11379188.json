It utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria to generate card advantage and protect its own life total. The deck also includes board wipes like Fumigate and Settle the Wreckage to handle large threats. Search for Azcanta helps filter draws while Torrential Gearhulk provides a strong late-game threat. Overall, the deck aims to control the pace of the game, disrupt the opponent's strategies, and eventually win through incremental advantage."
