By utilizing cards like Ethereal Armor, Daybreak Coronet, and Rancor, the deck aims to create a high-powered, hard-to-interact-with attacker that can quickly close out games. This strategy allows for early aggression and puts pressure on the opponent to find removal quickly, while also providing card advantage through cards like Kor Spiritdancer. The deck aims to win the game before the opponent can stabilize or answer the threatening creature."

Card selection and digging for combo pieces through Sleight of Hand, Serum Visions, and Gifts Ungiven are key to achieving a critical mass of spells in the graveyard to execute the combo. Timing and sequencing of spells are crucial for success with this fast-paced and powerful deck."

The deck also utilizes cards like Path to Exile for removal and Courser of Kruphix for card advantage. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures and use cards like Gavony Township and Knight of the Reliquary to buff them up for lethal damage. The deck aims to win the game quickly through aggressive creature plays and smart combat decisions."
