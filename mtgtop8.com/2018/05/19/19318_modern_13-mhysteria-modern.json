This allows the player to have a large, powerful creature early in the game that can close out matches quickly. The deck also includes disruption in the form of discard spells like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek, as well as removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to help control the board and protect the Death's Shadow threat. The deck aims to be aggressive and efficient in order to win the game as quickly as possible."
