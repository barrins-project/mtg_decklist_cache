The synergy between Human tribal effects and powerful individual creature abilities allows for both a wide variety of threats and a high degree of disruption against opposing strategies."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while generating incremental advantage through cards like Snapcaster Mage, Liliana, the Last Hope, and Search for Azcanta. By efficiently answering threats and drawing cards, the deck is able to grind out the opponent until it can close out the game with powerful finishers like Tasigur, the Golden Fang and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The land base is designed to support the control elements of the deck and provide consistent mana for its spells."
