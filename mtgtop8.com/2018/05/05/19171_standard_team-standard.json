The deck also uses control spells like Settle the Wreckage and Cast Out to manage the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy. Search for Azcanta helps dig for key cards while Walking Ballista provides additional removal and a win condition. The deck aims to control the game until it can overwhelm the opponent with its powerful flyers and recursion abilities."
