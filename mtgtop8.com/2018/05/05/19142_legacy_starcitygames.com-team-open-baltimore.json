By using cards like Wasteland, Ghost Quarter, and The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale, the deck aims to deprive the opponent of resources while also utilizing lands like Dark Depths and Thespian's Stage to create a powerful win condition. Life from the Loam and Crop Rotation are key cards in this strategy, allowing the player to recur lands and find the necessary pieces for their game plan. Overall, the deck's goal is to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent by leveraging the power of lands."
