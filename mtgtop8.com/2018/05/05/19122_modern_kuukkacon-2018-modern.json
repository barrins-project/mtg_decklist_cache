The inclusion of Faithless Looting and Snapcaster Mage helps maintain card advantage and dig for key cards. By carefully managing life total and resources, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with powerful threats and disruption."

It uses powerful colorless threats like Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger, Wurmcoil Engine, and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to dominate the board and win the game. In addition, it includes cards like Oblivion Stone and Pyroclasm to control the opponent's board, while Expedition Map and Sylvan Scrying help find the necessary lands to establish the UrzaTron. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with big threats and efficient removal spells."
