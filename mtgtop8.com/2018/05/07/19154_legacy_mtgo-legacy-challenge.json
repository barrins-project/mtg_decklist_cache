This allows for explosive turns where you can overwhelm your opponent with powerful threats early in the game. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Cabal Therapy and Unmask to disrupt your opponent's game plan and protect your own combo. Overall, the deck focuses on assembling its combo pieces to win the game as quickly as possible."
