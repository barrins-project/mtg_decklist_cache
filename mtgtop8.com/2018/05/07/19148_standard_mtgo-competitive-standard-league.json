The deck also includes powerful planeswalkers like Liliana, Death's Majesty and Karn, Scion of Urza for added value. The Scarab God serves as a powerful late-game threat that can take over the game if left unchecked. The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain board control throughout the game."
