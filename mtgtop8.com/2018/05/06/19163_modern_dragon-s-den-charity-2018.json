By combining hexproof creatures like Gladecover Scout and Slippery Bogle with auras like Rancor, Ethereal Armor, and Daybreak Coronet, you can create a formidable threat that is difficult for your opponent to deal with. The deck also includes cards like Leyline of Sanctity to protect against targeted effects, making it a strong aggressive option in the Modern format."
