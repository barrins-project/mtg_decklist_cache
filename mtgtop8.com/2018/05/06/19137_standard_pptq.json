By playing efficient creatures like Toolcraft Exemplar and Benalish Marshal alongside powerful vehicles like Heart of Kiran, the deck aims to establish a dominant board presence early in the game. Cards like Sram's Expertise and Servo Exhibition provide additional creatures to the board while also generating value. Karn, Scion of Urza provides card advantage and flexibility, allowing the deck to maintain pressure on the opponent throughout the game."
