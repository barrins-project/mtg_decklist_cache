Once the graveyard is filled, the player can bring back these creatures with cards like Dread Return and trigger powerful effects like Bridge from Below to overwhelm the opponent. The deck also utilizes cards like Cabal Therapy for disruption and Lion's Eye Diamond for mana acceleration. The combo of graveyard recursion and creature sacrifice is key to this Dredge deck's success in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."

Punishing Fire can deal with small creatures and provide recurring removal, while Life from the Loam ensures a steady flow of lands and can recur important spells from the graveyard. Overall, the deck aims to lock down the opponent while setting up a strong win condition with the Dark Depths combo."

By using low-cost burn spells and aggressive creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Price of Progress punishes opponents for playing non-creature spells or running non-basic lands, further helping to secure a quick victory. The deck's strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with relentless aggression and burn spells."
