It aims to establish a board presence quickly by using cards like Noble Hierarch and Champion of the Parish to accelerate mana and pump up creatures. Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter disrupt opponents' strategies while Mantis Rider and Kessig Malcontents deal damage efficiently. The deck's mix of disruption, aggression, and synergy between cards like Aether Vial and Thalia's Lieutenant makes it difficult for opponents to stabilize or respond effectively."

            "notes": "The deck revolves around maximizing mana and card draw using artifacts like Mox Opal, Ancient Stirrings, and Terrarion to quickly assemble the combo pieces of Scrap Trawler, Myr Retriever, and Krark-Clan Ironworks. This allows for infinite loops of sacrificing artifacts for mana and card draw, eventually leading to a win condition such as Aetherflux Reservoir. The deck also includes utility lands like Inventors' Fair and Buried Ruin to recur key pieces and ensure consistency in executing the combo. Additionally, cards like Engineered Explosives provide a way to control the board and protect the combo pieces."

By fetching Valakut and a few Mountains with Primeval Titan's ability, the deck can deal massive amounts of damage to the opponent in a single turn. Cards like Through the Breach allow for explosive plays, while Search for Tomorrow and Explore help to accelerate mana development. The deck aims to win the game in a single turn by overwhelming the opponent with massive amounts of direct damage."
