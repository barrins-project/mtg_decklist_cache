With the help of cards like Arcbound Ravager and Etched Champion, you can protect your key threats and also sacrifice artifacts for additional value. The deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with aggressive plays and close out the game quickly by utilizing the synergy between your artifacts and creatures. Additionally, the deck also has some resiliency with cards like Welding Jar to protect key pieces."

It also disrupts the opponent's hand with cards like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, while utilizing removal spells like Fatal Push and Lightning Bolt to control the board. The deck's mana base is built around fetching lands with cards like Verdant Catacombs and Bloodstained Mire to ensure consistency and access to the necessary colors for its spells. Jund Aggro aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of aggression and disruption."
