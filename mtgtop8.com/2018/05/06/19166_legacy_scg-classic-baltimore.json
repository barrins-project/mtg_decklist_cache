Wasteland is included to disrupt the opponent's mana base, while True-Name Nemesis and Gurmag Angler provide resilient threats that are difficult for opponents to deal with. This deck is designed to apply pressure early and maintain tempo throughout the game."

By using fast mana sources like Simian Spirit Guide and lands like Ancient Tomb, the deck aims to put out threats quickly and efficiently. The inclusion of powerful creatures like Reality Smasher and Thought-Knot Seer allows the deck to apply pressure and disrupt the opponent's hand, while also having versatile answers like Dismember and Umezawa's Jitte to deal with threats. Additionally, the deck has a strong mana base with a mix of utility lands to support its aggressive strategy."
