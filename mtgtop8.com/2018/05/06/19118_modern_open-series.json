The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain board advantage through card advantage and versatile answers. It also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Jace, the Mind Sculptor for additional card advantage and control. The mana base is built to support spells of three different colors, allowing for flexibility in casting spells and maximizing efficiency in playing threats and answers."
