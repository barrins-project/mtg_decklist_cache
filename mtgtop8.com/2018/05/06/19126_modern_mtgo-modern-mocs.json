Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Blood Moon and Spell Snare helps to disrupt the opponent's mana base and key spells, giving the deck a strong advantage in longer, grindy matchups."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on utilizing cards like Thoughtseize and Inquisition of Kozilek to disrupt the opponent's hand while cycling through the deck with Thought Scour and Serum Visions to quickly bring out powerful threats like Gurmag Angler and Death's Shadow. With a mix of removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to control the board, combined with counterspells like Stubborn Denial to protect its threats, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early and close out the game before they can establish their own game plan."
