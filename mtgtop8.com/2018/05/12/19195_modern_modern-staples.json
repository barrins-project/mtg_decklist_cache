The key strategy is to control the board with spells like Cryptic Command and Terminate while using Snapcaster Mage and Search for Azcanta to gain card advantage. Jace, the Mind Sculptor provides additional versatility and card selection, allowing the player to outmaneuver their opponent. The deck also includes some early game removal like Lightning Bolt and Fatal Push to deal with threats quickly. The overall goal is to grind out the opponent and win through incremental advantage."
