By quickly ramping up mana production and card draw, it aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures and pump effects, especially with cards like Timberwatch Elf and Wellwisher. The main strategy is to outpace the opponent with aggressive plays and maintain a steady flow of threats to close out the game swiftly."
