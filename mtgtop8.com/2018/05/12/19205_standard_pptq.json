The deck utilizes efficient and removal spells like Fatal Push, Vraska's Contempt, and Ravenous Chupacabra to eliminate threats. It also focuses on card advantage and deck digging with cards like Adventurous Impulse and Glint-Sleeve Siphoner. The deck aims to accelerate its mana with Llanowar Elves and Aether Hub and then play powerful creatures like Verdurous Gearhulk and Jadelight Ranger to overwhelm the opponent. The deck also has a small graveyard synergy with Ifnir Deadlands."
