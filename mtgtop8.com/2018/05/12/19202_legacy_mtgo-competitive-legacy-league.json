The deck is built around setting up these combos through card draw and manipulation with spells like Ponder, Brainstorm, and Preordain, while also running a number of counterspells like Force of Will and Spell Pierce to protect the combo. The deck aims to win the game by overwhelming the opponent with massive creatures before they have a chance to react."

By utilizing rituals, fast mana sources, and card draw spells, the deck aims to assemble its combo pieces as quickly as possible to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to respond. The inclusion of creatures like Elvish Spirit Guide and Simian Spirit Guide allows for explosive starts and increased consistency in pulling off the combo."
