By utilizing cards like Glimpse of Nature and Green Sun's Zenith, the deck aims to draw through the deck quickly and set up a game-winning combo with Craterhoof Behemoth or Natural Order. With the combination of mana acceleration from cards like Gaea's Cradle and Heritage Druid, this deck can overwhelm opponents with a massive board presence and finish them off in a single turn."
