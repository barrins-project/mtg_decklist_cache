Cards like Explore and Azusa, Lost but Seeking help to accelerate the mana advantage, while cards like Engineered Explosives and Walking Ballista provide removal and control options. The deck aims to assemble the Amulet Titan combo quickly to overwhelm the opponent with massive threats and utility lands. The key strategy revolves around utilizing the powerful synergy between lands and creatures to generate overwhelming board presence and close out the game."
