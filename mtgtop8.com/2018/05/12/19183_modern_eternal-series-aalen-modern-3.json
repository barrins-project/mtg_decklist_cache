By utilizing cards like Lightning Bolt, Monastery Swiftspear, and Goblin Guide, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early in the game. Cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Boros Charm offer additional damage and protection. The mana base is designed to support the low curve of the deck, allowing for consistent plays in the early turns. Overall, the deck aims to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize."
