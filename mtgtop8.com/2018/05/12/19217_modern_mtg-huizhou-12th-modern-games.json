By using efficient creatures like Goblin Guide and Monastery Swiftspear along with powerful spells like Lightning Bolt and Boros Charm, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they can stabilize or gain control of the game. The inclusion of cards like Eidolon of the Great Revel and Skullcrack helps to prevent the opponent from gaining life or playing non-creature spells effectively, giving the deck a strong advantage in the early game."
