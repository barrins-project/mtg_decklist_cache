The deck also includes burn spells like Abrade and Unlicensed Disintegration to clear the way for attacks. The inclusion of cards like Scrapheap Scrounger and Hazoret the Fervent ensures that the pressure continues even in the later stages of the game. Chandra, Torch of Defiance provides card advantage and additional burn damage, while Rekindling Phoenix acts as a resilient threat. Emphasizing speed and aggression, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent quickly before they can stabilize."
