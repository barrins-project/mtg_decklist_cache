By utilizing powerful Human creatures like Champion of the Parish, Mantis Rider, and Thalia's Lieutenant, the deck aims to build a strong board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Kitesail Freebooter and Meddling Mage. With mana acceleration from Noble Hierarch and disruption from Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, the deck can quickly outpace the opponent and secure victory. The inclusion of Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment, while the land base supports the tribal synergies of the deck."

The win condition is to out value the opponent and control the board until you can secure the game with a strong finisher like Celestial Colonnade or Secure the Wastes. The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy and slowly grind out a victory through card advantage and powerful control spells."
