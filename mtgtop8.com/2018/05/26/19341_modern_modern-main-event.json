The deck also includes a variety of control elements such as Oblivion Stone and Wurmcoil Engine to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan, making it difficult for them to establish their own threats."

By utilizing Eldrazi Temple and the Tron lands (Urza's Mine, Urza's Power Plant, Urza's Tower), the deck can quickly ramp into its big threats. The deck also includes removal spells like Dismember and a Basilisk Collar for additional utility. The goal is to establish a dominant board presence and defeat the opponent before they can stabilize."

Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a relentless and efficient aggressive game plan."
