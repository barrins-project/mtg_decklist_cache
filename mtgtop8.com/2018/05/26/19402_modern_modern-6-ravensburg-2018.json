The deck aims to control the game by removing threats with Fatal Push and Crypt Incursion, and drawing cards with Visions of Beyond. The goal is to deplete the opponent's library as fast as possible to win the game through mill, while also protecting yourself with cards like Fraying Sanity and Jace's Phantasm."
