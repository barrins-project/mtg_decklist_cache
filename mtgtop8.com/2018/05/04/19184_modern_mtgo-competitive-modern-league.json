Collected Company and Lead the Stampede help to find key pieces quickly, while Chord of Calling provides additional flexibility in tutoring for specific elves. The synergy between the elves' mana abilities and Ezuri's ability to give them trample and a power boost is the key to overwhelming the opponent and securing victory."

By playing efficient, low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Goblin Guide, combined with powerful burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Lava Spike, you can quickly chip away at your opponent's life total. The key strategy is to apply constant pressure and prevent your opponent from stabilizing by keeping their board clear and their life total low. This aggressive playstyle aims to win the game quickly before your opponent can establish a strong defense."
