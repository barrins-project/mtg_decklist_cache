By playing efficient low-cost creatures like Goblin Bushwhacker and Goblin Cohort alongside burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning, the goal is to quickly reduce the opponent's life total to zero before they have a chance to stabilize. This deck aims to capitalize on early game aggression and consistent damage output to secure a swift victory."

The deck also includes flicker effects (Ghostly Flicker) to reuse powerful enter-the-battlefield effects on creatures like Stonehorn Dignitary, creating a lockout situation for the opponent.
