The Knights of Grace and Malice provide additional protection and aggression, while The Scarab God acts as a powerful threat and value engine. The inclusion of cards like Commit / Memory and History of Benalia help maintain card advantage and board presence, making this deck a formidable opponent in a control matchup."
