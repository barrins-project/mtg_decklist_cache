The key strategy is to efficiently ramp up artifact count with cards like Thoughtcast and Myr Enforcer, while utilizing cards like Galvanic Blast and Atog to deal direct damage and leverage powerful effects. The deck also includes card draw and protection spells to maintain tempo and outpace the opponent. By effectively managing resources and maximizing synergy within the deck, the Aggro-Affinity archetype aims to win efficiently and decisively."
