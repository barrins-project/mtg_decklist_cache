The key strategy is to establish an early board presence with efficient creatures like Goblin Chainwhirler and Scrapheap Scrounger, while using removal spells like Unlicensed Disintegration and Abrade to clear the way for aggressive attacks. Chandra, Torch of Defiance and Karn, Scion of Urza provide additional card advantage and versatility, while cards like Heart of Kiran and Glorybringer can quickly close out games with their powerful abilities."
