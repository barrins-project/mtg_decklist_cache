The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with relentless attacks, while using cards like Bomat Courier and Soul-Scar Mage to maintain card advantage and board presence. With a focus on fast-paced gameplay and consistent damage output, this Aggro Red Deck Wins archetype is designed to take control of the game early and maintain pressure until victory is achieved."
