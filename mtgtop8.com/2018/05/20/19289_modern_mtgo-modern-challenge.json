By manipulating the graveyard, tutoring for key cards, and generating mana efficiently, the deck aims to curve out powerful creature combos to overwhelm the opponent in a fast and consistent manner. The inclusion of various cantrips and mana sources helps to smooth out draws and ensure the deck can execute its game plan effectively."

            "notes": "The main idea of this Merfolk aggro deck is to overwhelm the opponent with a fast and aggressive strategy. By utilizing powerful lords like Lord of Atlantis and Master of the Pearl Trident, along with disruption cards like Harbinger of the Tides and Merfolk Trickster, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence quickly. Mutavault and Spreading Seas help to further boost the deck's overall power and consistency, while Aether Vial allows for efficient creature deployment. Overall, this deck focuses on tempo and pressure to outpace the opponent and secure victory."
