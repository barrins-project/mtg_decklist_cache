Primeval Titan can search for utility lands like Radiant Fountain or Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion, or strong lands like Vesuva and Gruul Turf to create powerful combinations. The deck also includes ways to protect its combo pieces with Pact of Negation and Engineered Explosives, while utilizing Sakura-Tribe Scout and Tolaria West for additional ramp and consistency. The goal is to establish a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent with efficient land drops and powerful creatures."
