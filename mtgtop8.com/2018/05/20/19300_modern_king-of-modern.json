By utilizing cards like Champion of the Parish, Mantis Rider, Noble Hierarch, and Thalia's Lieutenant, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence early on and apply pressure to the opponent. Cards like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter help disrupt the opponent's game plan, while cards like Aether Vial provide additional flexibility in deploying creatures. With a mix of powerful creatures and disruption, this deck aims to quickly beat down the opponent before they can stabilize."
