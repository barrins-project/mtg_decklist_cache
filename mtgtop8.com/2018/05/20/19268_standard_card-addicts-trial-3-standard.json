The win condition is either stalling the game until Approach of the Second Sun is cast twice or overwhelming the opponent with powerful planeswalkers and big finishers like Torrential Gearhulk. The key strategy is to control the game's pace and resources until the deck's powerful late-game threats can take over and secure victory."
