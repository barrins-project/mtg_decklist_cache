By utilizing cards like Devoted Druid and Vizier of Remedies, the deck aims to generate infinite mana which can then be used to create a large Walking Ballista for a game-ending attack. Chord of Calling and Collected Company are used to search for key pieces of the combo, while Gavony Township provides a way to enhance the creatures on the battlefield for added effectiveness. The deck is designed to quickly assemble its combo pieces and overwhelm opponents with its powerful interactions."
