Additionally, cards like Master of Waves and Merrow Reejerey provide additional value by generating tokens and tapping down opponent's creatures, respectively. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Harbinger of the Tides and Merfolk Trickster to disrupt opponent's strategies. Overall, the deck aims to establish a fast and aggressive board presence to quickly defeat the opponent."

The deck focuses on creating a board presence with creatures like Auriok Champion and Ranger of Eos, and buffing them with Honor of the Pure. The deck also includes removal spells like Path to Exile and Proclamation of Rebirth to control the opponent's board. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of lifegain and creature aggression."
