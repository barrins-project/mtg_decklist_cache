Additionally, cards like Oblivion Stone and All Is Dust help maintain board control, while Wurmcoil Engine and Walking Ballista provide additional threats to win the game."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan by countering key spells and removing threats with cards like Path to Exile and Detention Sphere. The deck also utilizes planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Jace, the Mind Sculptor for card advantage and tempo advantage. The win condition is typically through a combination of card advantage, Celestial Colonnade beatdowns, and controlling the board until the opponent runs out of resources. The deck aims to outvalue its opponent and win through incremental advantages."

Steel Overseer provides additional support by adding counters to all artifact creatures, while Galvanic Blast can be used as removal or a direct damage spell. The combination of cheap creatures and powerful artifacts allows the deck to overwhelm opponents with a fast and aggressive strategy that aims to finish the game quickly."
