By using creatures like Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Leonin Arbiter to slow down your opponent's spells and searches, along with disruption from Tidehollow Sculler and Thought-Knot Seer, you can control the pace of the game. Meanwhile, the combination of Eldrazi Displacer and Flickerwisp can create powerful interactions and provide additional disruption. This deck aims to disrupt and pressure the opponent to secure a quick victory."

The deck aims to win the game before the opponent can establish their own board presence."

By disrupting your opponent's board with cards like Beast Within and Faerie Macabre, you can ensure that your Living End combo goes off successfully."
