By utilizing artifacts such as Terrarion, Ichor Wellspring, and Myr Retriever in combination with Scrap Trawler, players can generate large amounts of mana and card advantage to overwhelm opponents quickly. The deck also includes tools like Engineered Explosives and Pyrite Spellbomb for removal and alternate win conditions. Overall, the deck aims to efficiently assemble its combo pieces to dominate the game."

By utilizing cards like Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, the deck aims to power out early threats and equip them with Cranial Plating for massive damage. The deck also includes key finishers like Etched Champion and Arcbound Ravager to close out the game quickly. The deck prioritizes speed, efficiency, and overwhelming the opponent with a barrage of small but powerful creatures."

Burning Inquiry and Goblin Lore help to dig through your deck and discard cards for more graveyard shenanigans. Lingering Souls provides additional value with its flying tokens, while Lightning Bolt serves as removal or direct damage. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with fast creatures and graveyard synergies."
