The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's plans with counterspells and removal like Swords to Plowshares, while also generating card advantage through cards like Snapcaster Mage and Brainstorm. The deck also includes efficient threats like True-Name Nemesis and Geist of Saint Traft to close out the game quickly once the opponent's resources have been depleted."
