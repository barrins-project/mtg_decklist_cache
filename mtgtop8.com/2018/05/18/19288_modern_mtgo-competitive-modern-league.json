By using Lantern of Insight to see the top card of their library and Codex Shredder to control what they draw, the deck can grind out wins by keeping the opponent's resources limited. Cards like Ensnaring Bridge and Witchbane Orb further enhance the control aspect, while the artifact package of Mox Opal and Whir of Invention allow for efficient setup and execution of the game plan. Overall, the deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy and locking them out of the game."

The deck also aims to control the board with removal spells such as Maelstrom Pulse and Abrupt Decay. Additionally, cards like Liliana of the Veil and Tireless Tracker provide value and card advantage throughout the game. The mana base is built to support the two-color Golgari archetype, with a mix of dual lands and utility lands."

The deck also aims to control the board with removal spells such as Path to Exile and Abrupt Decay. The deck's versatility is highlighted by its mix of hand disruption, removal, and powerful threats, allowing it to adapt to various matchups in a Modern 1 vs 1 setting."
