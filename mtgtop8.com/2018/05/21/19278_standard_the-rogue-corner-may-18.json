            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to quickly establish a board presence and apply pressure on the opponent through aggressive creatures like Zahid, Djinn of the Lamp, Walking Ballista, Toolcraft Exemplar, and Scrapheap Scrounger. It also utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Gideon of the Trials for additional control and card advantage. Support cards like Seal Away, Karn, Scion of Urza, and Cast Out help deal with threats from the opponent while Aethersphere Harvester provides additional staying power. The mana base is designed to ensure consistency and smooth curve progression."
