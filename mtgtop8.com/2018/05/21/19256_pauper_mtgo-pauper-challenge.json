By efficiently using low-cost spells like Gitaxian Probe and Lightning Bolt, as well as creatures like Ghitu Lavarunner, the deck aims to apply constant pressure and force the opponent to react defensively. The key strategy is to maintain a high tempo throughout the game, chipping away at the opponent's life total until victory is achieved."
