The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of hasty creatures like Earthshaker Khenra and Ahn-Crop Crasher, while using powerful finishers like Hazoret the Fervent and Lyra Dawnbringer to close out the game. The inclusion of removal spells like Abrade and Chandra, Torch of Defiance helps to clear the way for the aggressive creatures to attack freely."
