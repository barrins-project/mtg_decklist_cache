            "notes": "The main concept of this Sultai Aggro deck is to quickly establish a board presence and overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and powerful synergy between cards like Winding Constrictor and Walking Ballista. The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Fatal Push and Vraska's Contempt while also protecting its own creatures with Blossoming Defense. The end goal is to use cards like Hadana's Climb and Verdurous Gearhulk to close out the game with powerful attacks, taking advantage of the energy and +1/+1 counters generated by the deck's creatures."
