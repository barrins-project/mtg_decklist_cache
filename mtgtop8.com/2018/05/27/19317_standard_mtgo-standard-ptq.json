The deck aims to control the game until it can reach its win condition, which is usually by outvaluing the opponent with powerful spells and efficient creatures like Torrential Gearhulk. The deck also has some utility lands like Field of Ruin to disrupt the opponent's mana base and Arch of Orazca for additional card draw."

The key strategy is to establish board presence with artifact creatures and use cards like Karn, Scion of Urza and Herald of Anguish to generate card advantage and control the game. The deck also includes some removal and life gain to help stabilize against aggressive opponents."
