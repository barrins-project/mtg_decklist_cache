The deck also aims to generate card advantage through cards like Brainstorm and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. Additionally, the deck utilizes powerful mana accelerants like Noble Hierarch and Deathrite Shaman to ramp out its threats ahead of schedule. By combining aggression with disruption and card advantage, this deck seeks to overpower the opponent and emerge victorious."
