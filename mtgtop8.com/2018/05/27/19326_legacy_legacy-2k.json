By utilizing cards like Nettle Sentinel and Heritage Druid, this deck can generate a lot of mana quickly to cast powerful spells like Craterhoof Behemoth. Additionally, cards like Wirewood Symbiote and Quirion Ranger provide utility and flexibility in the deck's strategy. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a large number of Elves and win the game through a powerful attack."
