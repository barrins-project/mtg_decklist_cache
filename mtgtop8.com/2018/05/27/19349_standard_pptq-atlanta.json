The deck also includes cards like Vraska's Contempt and The Eldest Reborn to deal with opponent's threats and generate additional value. The mana base is built to support the deck's color requirements and provide consistency in casting spells. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and establish control over the board before winning the game with its powerful creatures and planeswalkers."
