            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive red creatures and efficient burn spells. By applying constant pressure with cheap, hasty creatures like Ahn-Crop Crasher and Earthshaker Khenra, backed up by direct damage spells like Shock and Lightning Blast, this deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total before they can stabilize. Hazoret the Fervent provides a powerful late-game threat, while the inclusion of Soul-Scar Mage helps to weaken opposing creatures and makes burn spells even more potent. This deck is all about fast, relentless aggression."

The deck also employs land disruption with Field of Ruin and graveyard manipulation with Ipnu Rivulet. Overall, the goal is to maintain control of the game and eventually win through card advantage and powerful finishers."
