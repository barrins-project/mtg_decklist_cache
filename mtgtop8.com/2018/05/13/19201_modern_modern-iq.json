The mana base is built to support the multicolor requirements of the deck, with Tribal Flames as a powerful finisher. The inclusion of Noble Hierarch and Boros Charm allows for ramping and protection, while Ghor-Clan Rampager and Qasali Pridemage provide additional avenues for aggression and disruption. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with fast, efficient creatures and removal spells."
