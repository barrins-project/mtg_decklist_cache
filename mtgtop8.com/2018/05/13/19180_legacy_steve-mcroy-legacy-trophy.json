            "notes": "This Legacy UR Aggro deck focuses on quickly deploying aggressive creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Delver of Secrets while using cheap burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning to clear the way for damage. The deck includes card draw and selection with Brainstorm and Ponder, along with disruption from counterspells like Force of Will. The goal is to apply constant pressure on the opponent and finish the game quickly before they have a chance to stabilize. The deck also has some reach with cards like Price of Progress and Fireblast to close out games."
