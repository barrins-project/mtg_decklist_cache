Removal spells like Fatal Push and Cast Out help maintain board control, while planeswalkers Gideon of the Trials and Karn, Scion of Urza provide additional threats and card advantage. The mana base is optimized for consistency and speed, allowing the deck to put pressure on opponents early and close out games before they can stabilize."
