It is a fast-paced, aggressive strategy designed to win the game before the opponent can fully set up their own game plan."

The deck also includes various removal options such as Ravenous Chupacabra and Plaguecrafter to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the goal is to maintain pressure on the opponent while generating card advantage through effects like Midnight Reaper and Jadelight Ranger."

Experimental Frenzy and The Flame of Keld offer card advantage and extra damage potential to help secure victory."
