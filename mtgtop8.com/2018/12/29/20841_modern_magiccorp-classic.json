The deck also has some land disruption with cards like Ghost Quarter and Bojuka Bog to further disrupt the opponent's strategy."

This allows the player to cast powerful threats like Primeval Titan early in the game and search for key cards with Tolaria West. The deck also includes several utility lands and creatures to deal with different situations, along with a small amount of interaction and protection in the form of Pact of Negation. Overall, the key strategy is to ramp up quickly and overwhelm the opponent with powerful threats."

By utilizing a mix of utility creatures like Knight of Autumn and efficient mana producers like Birds of Paradise and Noble Hierarch, the deck aims to create a flexible and powerful board state. The inclusion of Zulaport Cutthroat adds a combo finisher element, while cards like Scryb Ranger and Militia Bugler help ensure consistency in finding key pieces. The creature toolbox approach is further supported by cards like Eternal Witness and Mirror Entity for added versatility."
