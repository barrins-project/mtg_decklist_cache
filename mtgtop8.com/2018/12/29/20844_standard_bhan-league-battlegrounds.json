History of Benalia and Heroic Reinforcements provide a burst of power to overwhelm opponents, while Conclave Tribunal helps to handle any threats on the board. The goal is to apply pressure early and maintain it throughout the game, utilizing the aggressive nature of the deck to quickly close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
