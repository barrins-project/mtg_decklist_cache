By using cards like Spell Queller, Mausoleum Wanderer, and Drogskol Captain, the deck can quickly build up a strong board presence while disrupting the opponent's plans with counter spells and removal. Cards like Collected Company and Aether Vial help to quickly get creatures onto the battlefield, while Noble Hierarch provides mana acceleration. The deck aims to quickly close out the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
