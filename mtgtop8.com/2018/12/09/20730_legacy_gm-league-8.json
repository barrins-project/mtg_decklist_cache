By using cards like Street Wraith, Thoughtseize, and Snuff Out, you can both lower your life total and disrupt your opponent's game plan. This aggressive approach is complemented by efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Abrupt Decay, as well as countermagic in the form of Force of Will and Daze. The deck also features versatile threats like Gurmag Angler and Delver of Secrets to apply pressure on your opponent."
