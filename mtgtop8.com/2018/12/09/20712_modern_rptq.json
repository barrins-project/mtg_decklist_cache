The deck also includes various ways to tutor for and retrieve the UrzaTron pieces, along with disruption and removal spells to control the board and protect the key threats."

It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while establishing its own win condition through cards like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Celestial Colonnade. By efficiently managing resources and controlling the board, the deck seeks to outlast opponents and eventually secure victory through incremental advantages and powerful threats. The combination of instant-speed removal, card advantage, and versatile threats allows the deck to adapt to various matchups and navigate different game states effectively."
