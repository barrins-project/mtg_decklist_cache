Cards like Reflector Mage and Meddling Mage provide disruption to control opponent's plays, while Mantis Rider and Kitesail Freebooter help maintain pressure and further disrupt the opponent's strategy. The mana base allows for consistent casting of creatures while also providing some card draw with Horizon Canopy."

The deck focuses on maintaining board control through cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Terminus while also generating card advantage with Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. The deck also includes land destruction with Field of Ruin and Ghost Quarter to disrupt the opponent's mana base. Overall, the key concept of this deck is to out-value and out-control the opponent until it can secure a win condition."
