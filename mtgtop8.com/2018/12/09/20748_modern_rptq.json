The mana base is carefully designed to support the aggressive tempo of the deck."

The deck focuses on assembling the combo pieces quickly to generate a large amount of mana, allowing for explosive plays and potentially winning the game in a single turn. Additionally, the deck includes various artifacts that can be sacrificed for additional value and disruption through Engineered Explosives."
