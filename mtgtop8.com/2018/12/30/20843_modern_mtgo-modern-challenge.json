By enabling cards like Bloodghast and Prized Amalgam to repeatedly enter the battlefield from the graveyard, the deck can create a strong attacking presence and overwhelm the opponent. Additionally, the deck has access to removal and burn spells like Conflagrate to control the board and finish off opponents."

Ghost Quarter and Eldrazi Temple provide additional utility and mana acceleration, allowing you to quickly overwhelm your opponent with efficient threats. This deck seeks to control the game tempo and punish opponents who rely heavily on their lands or low-cost spells."
