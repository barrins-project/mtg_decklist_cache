            "notes": "The main concept of this Golgari Aggro deck is to quickly overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures while utilizing various graveyard interactions and removal spells to maintain board control. The deck focuses on utilizing cards like Wildgrowth Walker and explore creatures (Seekers' Squire, Merfolk Branchwalker, Jadelight Ranger) to ramp up, gain life, and pressure the opponent. Additionally, Carnage Tyrant provides a powerful finisher, while cards like Vivien Reid and Vraska's Contempt offer utility and removal options. Find / Finality serves as a versatile card for card advantage and board clearing."
