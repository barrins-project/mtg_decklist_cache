            "notes": "The main concept of this deck is to control the game by using counterspells, removal spells, and disruptive cards to disrupt the opponent's strategy while slowly gaining advantage through card advantage and incremental advantage. The deck focuses on using powerful planeswalkers like Liliana of the Veil and Jace, the Mind Sculptor to control the board, along with efficient removal spells like Fatal Push and Cast Down. The deck also utilizes creatures like Spellstutter Sprite and Bitterblossom to provide additional pressure and disruption. The mana base is carefully constructed to ensure consistency and flexibility in casting spells."
