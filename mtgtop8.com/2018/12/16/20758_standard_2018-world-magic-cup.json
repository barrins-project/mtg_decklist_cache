It also includes a small burn package with cards like Fight with Fire and Expansion/Explosion to finish off the opponent.

The deck also aims to go wide with cards like Saproling Migration and March of the Multitudes, while utilizing cards like Venerated Loxodon and Trostani Discordant for token buffs and lifegain. Overall, the deck aims to apply pressure and close out the game quickly through a combination of creature synergy and powerful spells."
