Distortion Strike and Groundswell can help push through damage, while Become Immense can be a big finisher. Inkmoth Nexus can also turn into a 10/10 flying infect creature."

This is achieved through a combination of cheap cantrips, burn spells, and free spells like Gut Shot. The deck aims to fill up its graveyard with cards like Faithless Looting and Thought Scour, while also controlling the board with cards like Thing in the Ice and Crackling Drake. The deck's mana base is optimized for casting spells quickly and efficiently to bring back Arclight Phoenix multiple times throughout the game."
