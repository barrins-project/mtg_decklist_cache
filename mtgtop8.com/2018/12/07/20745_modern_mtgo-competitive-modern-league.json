Once active, the goal is to copy powerful spells like Lightning Bolt and Burst Lightning with Pyromancer Ascension to generate a lethal storm count and finish off the opponent quickly. The deck also utilizes cards like Thing in the Ice and Crackling Drake as alternate win conditions if the storm plan is disrupted. It requires precise sequencing and careful resource management to effectively combo off and win the game."
