The deck aims to control the pace of the game, stabilizing with board wipes like Damnation and Wrath of God, while generating card advantage with repeatable threats like Gideon Jura and Liliana of the Veil. By managing the battlefield and using disruptive spells like Inquisition of Kozilek and Thoughtseize, the deck aims to control the game until it can secure victory with powerful finishers like Gideon, Ally of Zendikar and Lingering Souls."

The land base includes multiple fetch lands to ensure you have the right colors of mana when needed.

            "notes": "The main concept of the deck is to utilize the synergy and power of Human creatures to overwhelm the opponent quickly. By playing aggressive creatures like Champion of the Parish, Thalia's Lieutenant, and Mantis Rider alongside disruptive creatures like Meddling Mage and Kitesail Freebooter, the deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent while utilizing cards like Aether Vial and Noble Hierarch to accelerate its strategy. The inclusion of various Thalias and other Human synergies help to make the deck more resilient and challenging for the opponent to deal with efficiently."
