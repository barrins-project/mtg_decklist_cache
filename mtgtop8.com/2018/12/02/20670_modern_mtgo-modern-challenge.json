Utilizing delve creatures like Tasigur, the Golden Fang and Gurmag Angler helps to take advantage of the filled graveyard and maintain pressure on the opponent. With a focus on speed and overwhelming the opponent with threats, this Aggro - Hollow One deck aims to win the game before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."

The deck aims to aggressively attack the opponent with efficient creatures like Reckless Bushwhacker and Flameblade Adept, while utilizing cards like Street Wraith and Insolent Neonate to fuel its graveyard strategy. By utilizing the aggro strategy of playing multiple threats in the early turns, this deck looks to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to stabilize."

            "notes": "The deck focuses on assembling the UrzaTron lands (Urza's Tower, Power Plant, Mine) to generate massive amounts of mana quickly, allowing the player to play powerful threats and control spells ahead of schedule. The deck includes card draw, counterspells, and removal to control the game until it can drop game-ending threats like Wurmcoil Engine or Ugin, the Spirit Dragon. It also has ways to tutor for key pieces like Expedition Map and Trinket Mage. Overall, the deck aims to establish board dominance and overwhelm the opponent with powerful plays."
