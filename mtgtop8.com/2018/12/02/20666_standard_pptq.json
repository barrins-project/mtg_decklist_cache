By combining powerful threats like Carnage Tyrant and Thief of Sanity with removal like Vraska's Contempt and Cast Down, you can control the board while still putting pressure on your opponent. Cards like Midnight Reaper and Find / Finality help you maintain card advantage and keep up the pressure. Utilizing Golgari Findbroker and Deathgorge Scavenger allows you to recycle key cards and disrupt your opponent's strategy. The deck aims to win quickly and decisively before the opponent can stabilize."
