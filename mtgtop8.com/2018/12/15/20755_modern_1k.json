By applying constant pressure and preventing the opponent from gaining life or stabilizing the board, the deck aims to win the game before the opponent can execute their larger game plan. The mana base is optimized for consistent and fast access to the necessary colors of mana, allowing for a smooth and streamlined gameplay experience."
