Once Valakut is online, the deck aims to cast Scapeshift to sacrifice a number of lands and search for multiple Mountains, triggering Valakut's ability to deal massive damage to the opponent. The deck also includes Primeval Titan to search for more Mountains and accelerate the combo. It is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with powerful burn damage."

It aims to out-value the opponent by efficiently dealing with threats, while drawing cards and manipulating the board state with planeswalkers. The win condition is often through card advantage, either by exhausting the opponent's resources or by taking over the game with powerful spells and planeswalker abilities. The deck's strategy revolves around disrupting the opponent's game plan and stalling the game until it can establish a dominant position and close out the game with threats like Celestial Colonnade."
