The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while also generating card advantage through cards like Treasure Map and Karn, Scion of Urza. Additionally, it has powerful finishers like Star of Extinction and Fight with Fire to close out the game once the opponent is unable to recover. The main focus is on controlling the board and outvaluing the opponent in the late game."
