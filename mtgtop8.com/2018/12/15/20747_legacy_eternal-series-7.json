The deck also includes disruption in the form of Duress and Thoughtseize to protect the combo and interact with the opponent's hand. The goal is to efficiently assemble the combo pieces and win the game in a single explosive turn."

The deck utilizes a combination of Force of Will, Counterspell, and Spell Pierce to disrupt opponents' game plans, while cards like Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Snapcaster Mage provide card advantage and selection. The inclusion of Terminus and Swords to Plowshares allows for efficient creature removal, while cards like Back to Basics and Counterbalance provide additional disruption. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and out-value opponents through efficient use of resources."
