The deck includes cheap spells like Lightning Bolt and Gut Shot to target the opponent's creatures or finish off the opponent, while also running card draw and library manipulation spells to ensure a consistent flow of spells. Crackling Drake offers a big threat in addition to Arclight Phoenix, while Thing in the Ice provides a defensive option against aggressive opponents."

It also includes versatile removal options like Oblivion Stone and All Is Dust to control the board while using Expedition Map, Sylvan Scrying, and Ancient Stirrings to find key pieces. The deck aims to establish board dominance while disrupting opponents' strategies with powerful threats and removal spells, ultimately leading to victory through overwhelming control."
