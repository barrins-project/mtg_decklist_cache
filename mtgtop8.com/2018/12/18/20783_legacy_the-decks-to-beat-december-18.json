It aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with counterspells, removal, and board wipes like Terminus and Supreme Verdict, while also drawing cards with Accumulated Knowledge and Ponder to maintain resources for the long game. The deck also includes cards like Back to Basics to slow down opponents relying on nonbasic lands, making it difficult for them to execute their own game plan."

The deck aims to chain together spells like Dark Ritual, Cabal Ritual, and Lion's Eye Diamond to generate mana and eventually cast a lethal Tendrils of Agony to win the game. The deck includes various card selection and disruption spells to help the player assemble the necessary components for the combo and protect it from opposing interaction."
