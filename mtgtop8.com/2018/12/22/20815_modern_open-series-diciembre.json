It relies on playing artifacts such as Mox Opal, Terrarion, and Mind Stone to accelerate mana production and draw cards. The deck also includes cards like Mishra's Bauble and Ancient Stirrings to help find combo pieces. The goal is to eventually loop artifacts with Scrap Trawler and Krark-Clan Ironworks, generating infinite mana and sacrificing artifacts for value. This enables the player to win the game through various means, such as casting a large Walking Ballista or emptying the opponent's library with Pyrite Spellbomb."
