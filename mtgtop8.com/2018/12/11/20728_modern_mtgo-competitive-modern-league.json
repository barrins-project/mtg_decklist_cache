By ramping up mana and flooding the board with elves, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive and efficient plays. The inclusion of cards like Shaman of the Pack and Ezuri, Renegade Leader provides additional win conditions by draining the opponent's life or pumping up the elves for lethal attacks. This deck focuses on speed and synergy to outpace and outvalue the opponent."
