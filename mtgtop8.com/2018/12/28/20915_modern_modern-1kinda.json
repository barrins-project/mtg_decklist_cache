Cards like Fatal Push and Ensnaring Bridge provide defense, while Archive Trap, Hedron Crab, and Glimpse the Unthinkable quickly mill cards from the opponent's library. Visions of Beyond helps draw cards, Collective Brutality and Inquisition of Kozilek disrupt the opponent's hand, and Crypt Incursion provides life gain. The combination of milling and disruption aims to win the game by emptying the opponent's library."
