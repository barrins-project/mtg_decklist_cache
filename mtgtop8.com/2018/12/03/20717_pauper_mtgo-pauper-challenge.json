The deck aims to disrupt the opponent's plans while applying pressure on them with evasive threats. The mana base is streamlined with fetch lands and basics, allowing for consistent access to both black and blue mana sources. Overall, the deck is designed to be a fast and disruptive aggro control archetype, capitalizing on tempo advantage and card advantage."
