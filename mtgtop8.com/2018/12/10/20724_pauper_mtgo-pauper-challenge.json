The deck aims to apply pressure early and maintain a steady stream of threats to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of cards like Vault Skirge and River Boa provide added resilience against removal spells, while Quirion Ranger helps to ensure consistent mana development. Overall, the deck is built around the strategy of efficiently deploying threats and maximizing damage output."
