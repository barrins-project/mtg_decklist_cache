Utilizing cards like Soul-Scar Mage, Monastery Swiftspear, and Emberheart Challenger, combined with burn spells like Reckless Rage and Torch the Tower, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. By maintaining pressure on the opponent and controlling the board with cards like Cori-Steel Cutter and Boomerang Basics, the deck can secure victory before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. The key strategy is to stay aggressive and maintain a fast pace throughout the game."
