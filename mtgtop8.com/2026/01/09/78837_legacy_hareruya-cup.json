The deck uses a mix of mana acceleration, discard spells, and graveyard recursion to execute its game plan efficiently. The inclusion of Pact of Negation helps protect your combo from disruption, while cards like Cabal Therapy and Thoughtseize allow you to disrupt your opponent's game plan. The deck aims to win the game as quickly as possible by assembling its combo pieces and going for a decisive victory."
