It aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of creature aggression and card advantage, using the mono black color identity to maximize efficiency. The synergy between sacrificing creatures for effects like buffing other creatures or drawing cards is central to its strategy, along with utilizing low-cost creatures to apply early pressure and maintain board control."
