            "notes": "The main idea behind this deck is to control the game through the early and mid-game by using efficient removal, card draw, and mana ramping strategies. The deck focuses on assembling the Urzatron lands to generate a large amount of mana quickly, allowing for powerful plays such as casting high-cost creatures like Ulamog's Crusher or deploying multiple spells in a single turn. The deck also includes various support cards to disrupt the opponent's strategy and maintain card advantage, ultimately aiming to overpower the opponent with superior resources and threats."
