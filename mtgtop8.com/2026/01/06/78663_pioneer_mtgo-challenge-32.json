It also utilizes mana acceleration with cards like Elvish Mystic and Llanowar Elves to cast powerful spells like Collected Company and Elspeth, Storm Slayer. Thalia, Guardian of Thraben disrupts opponents' strategies while cards like Abandoned Air Temple and Boseiju, Who Endures provide utility and protection. The deck aims to maintain early pressure and tempo to secure a swift victory while also having resilience and control options to handle opposing threats."
