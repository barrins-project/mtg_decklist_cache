Sneaky Snacker and Guttersnipe provide additional damage triggers, while Kessig Flamebreather and Voldaren Epicure offer aggressive creatures. Lightning Bolt, Lava Dart, Fireblast, and Fiery Temper provide direct damage spells to finish off the opponent. Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery help generate card advantage, while Faithless Looting allows for card filtering. By efficiently using burn spells and aggressive creatures, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and win the game quickly."
