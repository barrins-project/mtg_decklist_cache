Wellwisher helps gain life to stay ahead of aggressive opponents while Masked Vandal provides flexibility to deal with artifacts. Priest of Titania is a key card to generate massive amounts of mana, and Generous Ent provides a strong finisher. Winding Way and Lead the Stampede help refill the hand with more elves, ensuring a steady stream of threats. Gingerbread Cabin adds some incidental lifegain. Overall, the strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of elves."

It aims to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and card advantage through sacrifice effects and card draw. The deck utilizes various sacrificial outlets and synergies to continually pressure the opponent and maintain a strong presence on the battlefield. The goal is to outpace the opponent and close out the game quickly before they can establish a solid defense."
