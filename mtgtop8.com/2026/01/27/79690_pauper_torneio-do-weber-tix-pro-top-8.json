By utilizing low-cost creatures like Voldaren Epicure and Sneaky Snacker, combined with burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fiery Temper, the deck aims to quickly deplete the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Faithless Looting and Highway Robbery provide card advantage and card selection to keep the pressure on the opponent. The deck also includes some lifegain and graveyard hate to help maintain board presence and disrupt the opponent's strategy."
