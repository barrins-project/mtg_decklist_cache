By using cards like Galvanic Blast and Makeshift Munitions, the deck can deal direct damage to the opponent while also using cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Reckoner's Bargain to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck utilizes a mix of artifact lands and artifact creatures to take advantage of the Affinity mechanic and generate explosive plays to secure victory."
