By efficiently using cheap counterspells and card draw, alongside evasive creatures like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain board presence. The inclusion of bounce spells like Boomerang and sleep effects like Sleep of the Dead further solidifies the control aspect of the deck, allowing for strategic disruption of the opponent's game plan."
