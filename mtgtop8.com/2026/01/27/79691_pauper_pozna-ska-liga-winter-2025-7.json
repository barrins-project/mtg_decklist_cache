The deck aims to apply pressure early on with creatures like Ninja of the Deep Hours and Moon-Circuit Hacker, while maintaining card advantage through cards like Of One Mind. Utilizing efficient creatures and disruption spells, this deck looks to outpace the opponent and overwhelm them with a fast, aggressive strategy."
