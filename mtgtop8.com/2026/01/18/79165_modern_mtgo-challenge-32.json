Generate mana quickly with Utopia Sprawl and Talisman of Impulse to play your high-cost Eldrazi creatures ahead of schedule. Use cards like Malevolent Rumble and Sowing Mycospawn to disrupt your opponent's strategies and maintain control over the game until you can overwhelm them with your Eldrazi army."
