It prioritizes dealing damage as quickly and efficiently as possible, while also preventing the opponent from gaining life or stabilizing their board. The inclusion of cards like Boros Charm and Roiling Vortex further enhances the deck's ability to deal damage and disrupt the opponent's game plan. The key strategy is to apply constant pressure and close out the game before the opponent has a chance to recover."
