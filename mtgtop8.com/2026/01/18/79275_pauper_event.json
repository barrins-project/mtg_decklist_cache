The deck utilizes card draw and counter spells to maintain control of the game while quickly building a board presence. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with early aggression and tempo advantage, utilizing evasion and removal spells to protect key threats. It aims to quickly close out games before the opponent can stabilize or mount a strong defense."
