The deck aims to control the game by utilizing cards like Smallpox, Sinkhole, and Vindicate to disrupt the opponent's mana base and key threats. Karn, Scion of Urza and Liliana of the Veil provide additional value and card advantage, while cards like Trinisphere and Crucible of Worlds help to further disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of powerful lands like The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale and Karakas adds additional layers of control to the deck."
