Additionally, the deck includes cards that provide incremental advantage, such as The Wandering Emperor and Restless Anchorage, to generate value over time. The deck also includes a variety of win conditions, such as Teferi, Hero of Dominaria, March of Otherworldly Light, and high impact finishers like Ultima and Castle Ardenvale, ensuring that the deck can close out the game once it gains control."
