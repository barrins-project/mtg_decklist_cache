Emry, Lurker of the Loch is used for recursion and card advantage, while cards like Mishra's Bauble and Mox Opal help ramp up mana quickly. The deck also includes disruptive elements like Force of Will and Sink into Stupor to control the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with artifact-based aggression while maintaining control of the game."
