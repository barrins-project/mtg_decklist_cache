The deck focuses on efficiently utilizing mana and tempo by playing multiple creatures early in the game, utilizing burn spells to remove blockers and finish off opponents, and utilizing cards like Rally at the Hornburg and Goblin Bushwhacker for explosive plays. The deck aims to maintain pressure on the opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
