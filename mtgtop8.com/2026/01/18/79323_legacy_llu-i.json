The key strategy is to quickly ramp up mana using Ancient Tomb and Lotus Petal to play powerful artifacts like Urza's Saga and Chalice of the Void. Emry, Lurker of the Loch allows for card advantage by recurring artifacts from the graveyard. By combining aggro creatures with efficient artifact-based control, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents quickly while maintaining board presence and disrupting their game plan."
