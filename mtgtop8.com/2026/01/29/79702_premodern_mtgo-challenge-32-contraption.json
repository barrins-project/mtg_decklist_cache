By combining cards like Lion's Eye Diamond, Brain Freeze, and Cabal Ritual, the deck aims to fill the graveyard quickly and then use Ill-Gotten Gains to bring back key cards from the graveyard. This allows for powerful plays and potential game-winning combos. The deck also includes various mana acceleration and card draw spells to help set up the combo efficiently. The focus is on executing the combo quickly and effectively to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."

By applying constant pressure with creatures like Grim Lavamancer, Mogg Fanatic, and Jackal Pup, combined with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Incinerate, the deck aims to finish the game quickly before the opponent has a chance to stabilize. Cards like Fireblast and Sulfuric Vortex provide additional reach to close out the game if needed. The deck prioritizes speed, aggression, and direct damage to overwhelm the opponent."
