It also utilizes instant-speed interaction with cards like Force of Negation and Prismatic Ending to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The strategy revolves around reanimating threats at instant speed while controlling the board to ensure the combo can go off successfully. It combines graveyard recursion with efficient removal and countermagic to dominate the mid-to-late game."

The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's strategy while also gaining incremental card advantage through cards like Cling to Dust and Consign to Memory. By using powerful control elements like Counterspell and Fatal Push, along with versatile creatures like Kaito, Bane of Nightmares and Wan Shi Tong, Librarian, the deck aims to outvalue and outmaneuver the opponent in order to secure victory."
