By utilizing cards like Faithless Looting to dig for key pieces and Grab the Prize to gain additional resources, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a constant stream of damage and aggression. Additionally, the inclusion of Fireblast provides a powerful finisher to secure victory in a swift and efficient manner."
