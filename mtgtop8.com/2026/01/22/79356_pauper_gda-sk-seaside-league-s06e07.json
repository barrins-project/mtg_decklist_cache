It includes a mix of counterspells, removal spells, and card draw to disrupt the opponent's strategy while maintaining card advantage. The main win condition revolves around establishing a board presence with creatures like Guardian of the Guildpact and Squadron Hawk while using defensive spells like Prismatic Strands to protect them. By effectively using Gates and controlling the game, this deck aims to outmaneuver opponents and secure victory through efficient resource management and strategic play."
