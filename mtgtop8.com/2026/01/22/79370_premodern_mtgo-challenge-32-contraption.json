By playing powerful and efficient creatures like Mogg Fanatic and Jackal Pup, along with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Incinerate, the deck aims to deal damage quickly and efficiently. Sulfuric Vortex and Flame Rift help to further pressure the opponent's life total, while Fireblast provides a powerful finisher. The deck is designed to be fast, relentless, and focused on dealing damage as quickly as possible to secure victory."
