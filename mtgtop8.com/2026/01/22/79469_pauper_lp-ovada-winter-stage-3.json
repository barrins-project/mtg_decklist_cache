The goal is to assemble the pieces of the combo quickly using card draw and search effects while controlling the board with removal spells like Malevolent Rumble. The deck also includes support cards like Golden Egg and Lembas to provide additional value and consistency. Overall, the strategy revolves around efficiently executing the combo while maintaining resource advantage and controlling the game tempo."
