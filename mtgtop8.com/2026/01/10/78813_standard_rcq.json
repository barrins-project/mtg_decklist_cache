By deploying a mix of counterspells, removal, and card draw, the deck aims to outlast the opponent and establish control of the board. Additionally, the deck includes a few finisher cards like Artist's Talent and Combustion Technique to close out the game once control is established. The deck also benefits from strong mana fixing with cards like Multiversal Passage and Riverpyre Verge to ensure smooth gameplay."
