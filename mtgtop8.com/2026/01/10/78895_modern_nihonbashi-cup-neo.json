It also includes a toolbox of creatures like Solitude and Emperor of Bones for interaction and removal. The deck also features disruptive cards like Thoughtseize and Force of Negation to protect the combo pieces. The mana base is designed to support multiple colors while still being able to cast the necessary spells. The key strategy is to set up a quick and efficient reanimation engine to overwhelm the opponent before they can respond."
