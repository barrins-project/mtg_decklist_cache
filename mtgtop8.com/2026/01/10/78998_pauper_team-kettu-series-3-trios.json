By playing artifact creatures like Myr Enforcer and utilizing cards like Thoughtcast to draw more cards, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient threats and removal spells like Galvanic Blast. The deck also has synergy with sacrificing artifacts for various effects, making it a powerful aggro deck that can quickly close out games."
