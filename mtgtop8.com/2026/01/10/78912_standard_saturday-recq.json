The deck also includes cards like Scalding Viper and Razorkin Needlehead to provide additional aggression. The mana base is focused on producing red mana efficiently to enable casting your spells quickly and effectively. The overall strategy is to apply pressure and finish off your opponent before they can stabilize."

Additionally, the deck includes win conditions such as Jeskai Revelation and Ultima to close out the game once the opponent has been sufficiently controlled. The mana base is designed to support the deck's triple color requirements with various dual and tri-lands."
