By managing the board with cards like Cast Down and Defile, while also generating value with Ichor Wellspring and Lembas, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and eventually win through incremental advantages. The graveyard is also utilized effectively with cards like Nihil Spellbomb and Heritage Reclamation, allowing for additional card advantage and strategic play. Ultimately, the goal is to dominate the game through careful resource management and leveraging the Golgari/Jund color combination's strengths."
