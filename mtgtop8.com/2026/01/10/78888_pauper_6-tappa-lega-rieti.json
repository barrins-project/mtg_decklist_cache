By utilizing cards like Pond Prophet and Tangled Islet to draw through the deck quickly, as well as protection from Spellstutter Sprite and removal from Masked Vandal, the deck aims to create an unstoppable milling engine. Additionally, the inclusion of cards like Gnaw to the Bone provides a solid defense against aggressive strategies, allowing the deck to survive long enough to assemble its combo."
