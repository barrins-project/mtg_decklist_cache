The deck also includes burn spells like Torch the Tower and Slagstorm to deal with threats and keep the opponent in check. With cards like The Enigma Jewel and Tezzeret, Cruel Captain, the deck can generate card advantage and outvalue the opponent in the long run. The aim is to control the game until you can overpower your opponent with a combination of artifacts and burn spells."

Your goal is to outpace the opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
