The inclusion of Galvanic Blast and other removal spells helps to ensure that the opponent's board is kept clear of threats. The mana base is composed mainly of artifact lands to support the Affinity mechanic and enable explosive plays."

By utilizing cards like Spellstutter Sprite to counter spells with converted mana cost 1, alongside removal spells like Snuff Out and Cast Down, the deck aims to control the board while digging for key cards with Brainstorm and Augur of Bolas. Additionally, the deck includes some card advantage with Ninja of the Deep Hours and Thorn of the Black Rose. The main win condition is to outvalue and outlast the opponent with a combination of control and efficient threats."
