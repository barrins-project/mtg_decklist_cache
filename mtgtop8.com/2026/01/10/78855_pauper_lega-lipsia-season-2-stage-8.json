It includes various 1-mana artifacts to help with mana fixing and card draw, as well as ways to sacrifice artifacts for value. Malevolent Rumble is included as a win condition that benefits from the high artifact count in the deck. The deck aims to control the game with removal and disruption until it can establish its mana base and overwhelm the opponent with powerful spells."
