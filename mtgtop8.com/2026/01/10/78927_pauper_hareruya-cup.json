By constantly playing small creatures like Squadron Hawk and Kor Skyfisher, the deck aims to quickly build up a board presence and put pressure on the opponent. Utilizing cards like Thraben Charm and Battle Screech allows for additional creatures to be put on the battlefield, maximizing the aggression of the deck. With a focus on white weenie creatures and token generation, this deck is designed to keep the pressure on and force the opponent to react quickly."
