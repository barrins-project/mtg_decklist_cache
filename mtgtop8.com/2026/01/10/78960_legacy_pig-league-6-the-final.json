Emry, Lurker of the Loch helps to recur artifacts from the graveyard, while cards like Chalice of the Void and Pithing Needle disrupt opponent strategies. The deck also utilizes fast mana acceleration with Mox Opal, Lotus Petal, and Mishra's Bauble. Urza's Saga provides additional artifact tutoring and the ability to create artifact tokens. Force of Will offers protection while Sink into Stupor helps to control the opponent's resources."
