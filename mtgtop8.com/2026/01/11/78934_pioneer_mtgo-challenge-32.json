            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to overwhelm your opponent with aggressive creatures and burn spells in order to quickly reduce their life total to zero. By utilizing low-cost creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Soul-Scar Mage, along with efficient burn spells like Burst Lightning and Reckless Rage, this deck aims to apply constant pressure and finish the game before the opponent can stabilize. The inclusion of card draw and mana fixing ensures consistency in maintaining a fast and aggressive game plan."
