The deck also includes various ways to draw cards and search for key pieces to control the game, such as Chromatic Star, Expedition Map, and Ancient Stirrings. Malevolent Rumble provides removal and disruption, while creatures like Generous Ent and Wretched Gryff offer additional value and defense."
