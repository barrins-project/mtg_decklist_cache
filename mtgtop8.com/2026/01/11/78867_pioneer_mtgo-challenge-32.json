The key strategy is to assemble the combo pieces as quickly as possible, allowing for explosive plays such as casting multiple high-cost spells in a single turn or activating powerful abilities multiple times. The deck also includes some protection and recursion elements to ensure resilience against disruption from the opponent. Overall, the main objective is to overwhelm the opponent with a massive amount of resources and threats, leading to a swift victory."
