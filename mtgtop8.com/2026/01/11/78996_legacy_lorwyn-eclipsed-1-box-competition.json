Overall, the deck aims to establish control through land manipulation and synergy."

It also has disruption in the form of Duress and Thoughtseize to protect its combo. The inclusion of Living Wish allows for additional flexibility in accessing sideboard cards in game two or three. The deck is designed to be fast and efficient, aiming to win the game in a single explosive turn."
