Lotleth Giant and Scrapwork Mutt provide a big finish, while Gnaw to the Bone helps gain life and stay in the game. The deck also includes cards like Town Greeter and Generous Ent to help find combo pieces and keep the engine running smoothly. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful combo reanimation strategy."
