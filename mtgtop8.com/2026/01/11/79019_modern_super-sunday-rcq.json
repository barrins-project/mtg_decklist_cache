By using Karn, the Great Creator to shut down opposing artifacts and Ugin, the Spirit Dragon to wipe the board, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent while protecting itself with cards like Devourer of Destiny and Thought-Knot Seer. With access to Emrakul, the Promised End as a finisher, this deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan and secure victory through sheer power and control."
