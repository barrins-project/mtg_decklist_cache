            "notes": "This UW Control deck focuses on controlling the opponent's plays through a combination of counterspells, removal spells, and disruptive cards like Narset, Parter of Veils and Teferi, Time Raveler. The deck aims to stall the game until it can establish a strong board presence with cards like Monumental Henge and Wrath of the Skies. It also utilizes card advantage engines like Lórien Revealed and Meticulous Archive to outvalue the opponent. The addition of Kaheera, the Orphanguard as a companion provides additional utility and synergizes well with the deck's strategy."
