Kiora, Behemoth Beckoner helps draw cards and ramp, while Storm the Festival helps find more threats. The deck also includes some disruption with Outcaster Trailblazer and Boseiju, Who Endures. Overall, the strategy revolves around quickly developing a strong board presence and overwhelming the opponent with efficient threats and powerful synergies."
