            "notes": "The deck focuses on using control elements to disrupt the opponent's strategy while simultaneously utilizing the Stoneblade package to generate card advantage and close out the game. It aims to control the board with removal and counterspells, while also using powerful threats like Murktide Regent and Stoneforge Mystic to apply pressure. Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student provides card selection and advantage, while Quantum Riddler offers additional disruption. The manabase is optimized for consistency and flexibility, with a mix of fetchlands and dual lands. Overall, the deck seeks to control the game and win through incremental advantage."
