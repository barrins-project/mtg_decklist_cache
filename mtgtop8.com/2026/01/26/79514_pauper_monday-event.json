The deck focuses on controlling the board through powerful creatures like Maelstrom Colossus and Oliphaunt, while also using removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Volcanic Spite to deal with opponent threats. Expedition Map is used to tutor for specific lands, while Candy Trail and Lembas provide additional card draw and resources. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big threats and efficient control spells."
