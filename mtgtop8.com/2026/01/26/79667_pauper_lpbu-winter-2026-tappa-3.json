By utilizing cards like Experimental Augury and Vivisurgeon's Insight, the deck aims to set up a combo of spells that can deal a lethal amount of poison damage in a single turn. The mana base is tailored to support this strategy by including cards like Pentad Prism and various land enchantments. The key strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with poison counters before they can stabilize or gain control of the game."
