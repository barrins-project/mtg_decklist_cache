The deck aims to stall the game with efficient removal in the early game, while using card draw and countermagic to maintain card advantage and prevent opponents from enacting their game plan. The key strategy is to outvalue opponents by efficiently dealing with threats and gaining incremental advantages over time, ultimately leading to a win through overwhelming card advantage and superior board control."

The inclusion of powerful creatures like Ouroboroid and Craterhoof Behemoth further strengthens this strategy, providing high-powered threats that can quickly close out the game. Additionally, the deck includes disruptive spells like Nature's Rhythm and Bounce Off to control the battlefield and maintain pressure on the opponent."

The deck also includes cards that provide card advantage and resilience, allowing the player to continually replenish their resources while disrupting the opponent's game plan. Finally, the inclusion of a few powerful finishers ensures that the deck can close out games quickly once it gains the upper hand."
