By efficiently generating mana with the Urzatron lands and artifacts like Chromatic Star and Prophetic Prism, the deck can quickly access its more powerful spells and threats. Pactdoll Terror and Eviscerator's Insight provide removal for enemy creatures, while Candy Trail and Weather the Storm offer support and protection. Overall, the key strategy of this deck is to establish board control and outvalue the opponent through efficient use of mana and powerful artifact synergies."
