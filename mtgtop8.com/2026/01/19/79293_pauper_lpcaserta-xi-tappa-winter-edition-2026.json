By using cheap creatures like Voldaren Epicure and Sneaky Snacker, along with efficient burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast, the deck aims to pressure the opponent's life total early on. The deck also includes card draw and discard effects like Thrill of Possibility and Faithless Looting to maintain a steady stream of threats and burn spells. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive creatures and direct damage spells."
