By utilizing cards like Delver of Secrets, Dragon's Rage Channeler, and Murktide Regent, along with efficient spells like Lightning Bolt and Daze, the deck aims to quickly deal damage and control the board. The deck also includes disruptive elements such as Wasteland and Force of Will to disrupt the opponent's game plan. This aggressive strategy is supported by card draw and manipulation with Brainstorm, Ponder, and Mishra's Bauble to maintain consistency and tempo."
