The deck also includes removal spells like Cast Down and Chainer's Edict to control the opponent's board. The use of Orzhov Basilica and Scoured Barrens helps maintain a steady mana base for consistent aggressive plays. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of creature aggression and disruptive spells."
