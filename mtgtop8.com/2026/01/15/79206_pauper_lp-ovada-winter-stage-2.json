The deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a mass of Persistent Petitioners and disrupt their strategy with cards like Masked Vandal. The deck also includes cards like Gnaw to the Bone for self-mill endurance and Winding Way for card filtering. The mana base consists of predominantly Island and Forest lands with some utility lands like Simic Growth Chamber for additional mana ramp."
