It uses control elements such as counterspells, card draw, and removal spells to disrupt the opponent's game plan. The deck also includes a combo involving Ghostly Flicker and Mnemonic Wall to generate infinite mana and loop spells or abilities. The win condition is typically through card advantage and out-valuing the opponent, eventually overwhelming them with powerful spells or creatures."
