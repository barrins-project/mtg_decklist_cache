The main strategy involves using low cost creatures like Guttersnipe and Voldaren Epicure to pressure the opponent while also utilizing burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast to finish them off. Faithless Looting helps to filter through the deck and find the necessary cards, while Grab the Prize provides additional reach. The goal is to be aggressive and proactive, aiming to outpace the opponent and win the game before they can stabilize."
