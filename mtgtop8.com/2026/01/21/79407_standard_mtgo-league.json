By strategically reanimating key creatures such as Ardyn, the Usurper and Overlord of the Balemurk, along with supporting spells like Awaken the Honored Dead and Bitter Triumph, the deck aims to quickly establish a board presence and dominate the game. Additionally, the deck includes cards that allow for card draw, mana fixing, and protection to ensure a smooth execution of the combo strategy."
