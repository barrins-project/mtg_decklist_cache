The deck includes cards that generate tokens, provide card advantage, and boost the team's power. It also has defensive elements like Prismatic Strands to protect its creatures. The key strategy is to play aggressively, utilizing the efficient creatures and combat tricks to pressure the opponent and win the game before they can mount a strong defense. The inclusion of cards like Guardians' Pledge and Battle Screech further enhances the deck's aggressive nature."
