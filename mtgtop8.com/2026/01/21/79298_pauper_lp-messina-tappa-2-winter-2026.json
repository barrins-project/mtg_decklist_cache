By utilizing cards that provide card advantage like Of One Mind and Ninja of the Deep Hours, as well as control elements like Counterspell and Dispel, this deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent. A key tactic is to utilize the Ninjutsu ability of cards like Ninja of the Deep Hours to continually apply pressure and maintain card advantage, ultimately leading to a swift victory."
