            "notes": "This deck focuses on aggressively playing artifacts and using them to deal damage to the opponent. It includes cards that benefit from having a high number of artifacts on the battlefield, such as Myr Enforcer and Krark-Clan Shaman. The deck also includes cards that can draw extra cards or remove threats, such as Thoughtcast and Nihil Spellbomb. By overwhelming the opponent with artifact creatures and using burn spells like Galvanic Blast, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total and win the game."
