Clockwork Percussionist and Goblin Tomb Raider provide additional support and disruption, while Rally at the Hornburg and Wrenn's Resolve help maintain board presence and push through damage. With a low mana curve and emphasis on quick creature deployment, this deck aims to set a fast pace and pressure the opponent to win quickly in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
