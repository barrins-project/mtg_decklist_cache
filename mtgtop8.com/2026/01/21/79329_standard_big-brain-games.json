The deck includes a mix of efficient creatures such as Burnout Bashtronaut and Nova Hellkite, along with burn spells like Burst Lightning and Lightning Strike to finish off opponents. The mana base is designed to provide consistent access to both red mana sources and splash white mana for added versatility. The goal is to apply constant pressure and fast damage output to secure victory before the opponent can establish a defense."
