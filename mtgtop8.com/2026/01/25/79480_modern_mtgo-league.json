The goal is to control the board and disrupt the opponent's game plan until you can close out the game with powerful threats like Hall of Storm Giants or Tishana's Tidebinder. Additionally, the deck utilizes cards like Subtlety and Sink into Stupor for additional control options. Overall, the key strategy is to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent through careful resource management and tempo plays."

Urza's Saga and Mox Opal provide ramp and additional artifact synergy, making the deck fast and powerful in an aggressive playstyle. The inclusion of various artifacts and synergistic cards create a strong affinity for artifacts, enabling quick and efficient plays to overwhelm the opponent."

Stubborn Denial and Lightning Bolt provide additional control and removal, while Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and Teferi, Time Raveler offer disruptive elements.
