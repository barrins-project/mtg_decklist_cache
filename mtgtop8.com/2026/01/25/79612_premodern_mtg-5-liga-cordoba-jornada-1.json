By constantly applying pressure and dealing direct damage, it aims to win the game as quickly as possible before the opponent can stabilize. The deck utilizes a low mana curve and powerful direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast to maintain momentum and close out the game before the opponent can mount a defense. The inclusion of cards like Sulfuric Vortex and Cursed Scroll also help to ensure that the opponent has limited options for countering the deck's aggression."
