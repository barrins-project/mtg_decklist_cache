The deck aims to quickly develop a strong board presence and disrupt the opponent's game plan through targeted removal and recursion. By using cards like Refurbished Familiar and Writhing Chrysalis, the deck can generate value and outvalue opponents in the mid to late game. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Krark-Clan Shaman and Fanatical Offering to provide flexibility and create advantageous board states. The deck also features a mix of land destruction and graveyard hate to disrupt opponents' strategies."
