It aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan while building up its own resources. The key strategy involves using creatures like Crypt Rats and Shambling Ghast to clear the board, while cards like Reckoner's Bargain and Eviscerator's Insight provide card advantage. The deck also includes some recursion with cards like Blood Fountain and Witch's Cottage to keep the engine running. With a mix of removal, card advantage, and creature sacrifice effects, this deck seeks to outvalue and outlast the opponent."
