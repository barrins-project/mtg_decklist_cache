The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and sweepers like Cataclysm, while also utilizing land destruction to limit the opponent's resources. The creatures in the deck, such as Terravore and Treetop Village, provide threats that can quickly close out the game once the control aspect is established."
