It combines countermagic, card draw, and bounce spells to control the game while continuously denying opponents the ability to untap lands. The deck aims to establish a dominant board state and slowly chip away at opponent's life with cards like Black Vise. Multiple ways to protect the Stasis lock, such as Counterspell, Daze, and Thwart, are included to ensure the combo's success."
