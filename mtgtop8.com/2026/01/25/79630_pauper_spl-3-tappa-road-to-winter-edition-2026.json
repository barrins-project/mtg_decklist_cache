Using a combination of cheap counterspells and card draw, the deck aims to maintain control while deploying threats like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent. By utilizing cards like Thought Scour and Mental Note to fill the graveyard, the deck can reduce the cost of their spells and enable the casting of powerful finishers. With a heavy focus on tempo and disruption, this Mono Blue Aggro deck aims to outpace and outmaneuver opponents in a Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
