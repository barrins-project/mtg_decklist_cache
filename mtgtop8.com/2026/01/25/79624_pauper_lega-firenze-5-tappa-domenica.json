It includes creatures like Self-Assembler and Maelstrom Colossus, as well as removal spells like Lightning Bolt and Suplex to control the board. Expedition Map helps find Urza's lands quickly, while Candy Trail and Lembas provide additional mana sources. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with big creatures and efficient removal spells while maintaining a strong mana base with Urza's lands."
