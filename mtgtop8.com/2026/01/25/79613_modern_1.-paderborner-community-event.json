By generating mana efficiently with Mox Opal and Springleaf Drum, and using cheap artifacts like Memnite and Pinnacle Emissary, the deck can quickly deploy threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Sink into Stupor and Engineered Explosives. The main win condition is to attack with a wide board of creatures, supported by cards like Metallic Rebuke and Thoughtcast to maintain card advantage. Urza's Saga is a key piece in tutoring for artifacts to further strengthen the board presence."

By utilizing cards like Dragon's Rage Channeler and Monastery Swiftspear to apply early pressure, combined with removal spells such as Lightning Bolt and Mutagenic Growth, the deck aims to finish off the opponent quickly before they have a chance to stabilize. With a focus on efficiency and aggression, the deck aims to control the board and win the game through consistent and relentless damage output."
