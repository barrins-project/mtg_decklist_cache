By using cards like Fiery Temper, Lightning Bolt, and Fireblast, along with creatures like Guttersnipe and Kessig Flamebreather, the deck aims to reduce the opponent's life total as quickly as possible. Additionally, cards like Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery provide additional ways to deal damage and gain advantage in the game. The deck focuses on building a fast and efficient offense to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."
