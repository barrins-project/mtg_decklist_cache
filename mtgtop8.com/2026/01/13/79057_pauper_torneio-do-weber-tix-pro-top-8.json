The key strategy is to quickly build up a board presence with evasive creatures like Faeries and Ninjas, while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with spells like Counterspell and Spell Pierce. By applying pressure early on and maintaining control of the game, this Mono Blue Aggro deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can stabilize."
