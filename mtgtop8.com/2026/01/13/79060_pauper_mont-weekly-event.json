By using cards that provide value through multiple creatures, such as Battle Screech and Prismatic Strands, the deck can maintain pressure and generate card advantage. The inclusion of bounce effects like Kor Skyfisher and Raffine's Informant allows for additional tempo plays. The deck also includes some removal in the form of Journey to Nowhere and Thraben Charm to deal with opposing threats. Overall, the strategy revolves around flooding the board with low-cost creatures and leveraging them for maximum impact."
