Chalice of the Void helps control your opponent's spells, while Wasteland disrupts their mana base. Cavern of Souls ensures your Eldrazi spells can't be countered, and Thought-Knot Seer provides disruption by allowing you to look at your opponent's hand and exile a card. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm your opponent with fast, powerful threats."

The deck utilizes a variety of fast mana sources such as Lotus Petal and Dark Ritual to power out its combo pieces quickly and uses disruptive cards like Thoughtseize and Unmask to protect the combo. The key to the deck is to assemble the combo pieces efficiently and execute the win condition before the opponent can stop it."
