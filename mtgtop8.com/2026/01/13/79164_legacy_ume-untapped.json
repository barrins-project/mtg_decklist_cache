This powerful creature can quickly end the game in your favor, especially when it enters the battlefield for free. The deck also includes various card draw and protection spells such as Brainstorm and Force of Will to help set up the combo and protect it once it is in play. The combination of these cards allows for a fast and powerful win condition in Legacy 1 vs 1 matches."

Additionally, the deck takes advantage of cards like Mox Opal and Urza's Saga to efficiently ramp up mana and generate value from artifacts."
