By then using Dread Return to reanimate a powerful creature like Lotleth Giant, you can deal a massive amount of damage to your opponent in one turn. The deck is designed to quickly assemble the combo pieces and overwhelm your opponent before they have a chance to react. The inclusion of cards like Lead the Stampede helps to find the combo pieces efficiently."
