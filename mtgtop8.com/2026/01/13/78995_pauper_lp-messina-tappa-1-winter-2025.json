The deck aims to stall the game with defensive creatures and bounce effects, while digging through the deck for key pieces using card draw spells like Preordain and Snap. By recurring spells with Archaeomancer and creating bird tokens with Murmuring Mystic, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and eventually overwhelm them with a powerful win condition."
