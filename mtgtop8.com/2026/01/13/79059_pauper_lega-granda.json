By using cards like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent, you can quickly establish a threatening board presence while using counterspells and disruptive spells to protect your creatures and disrupt your opponent's plan. The deck also utilizes card draw and graveyard interaction to maintain hand advantage and consistently put pressure on your opponent."
