The strategy revolves around maintaining a strong board presence, utilizing combat tricks and removal spells to push through damage, and leveraging the synergy between creatures and spells to create a winning strategy. The deck aims to be fast and aggressive, putting pressure on the opponent from the early turns of the game."
