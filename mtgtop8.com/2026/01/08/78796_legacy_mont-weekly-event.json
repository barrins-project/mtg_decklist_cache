It combines elements of graveyard recursion, creature removal, and mana denial to slow down the opponent and create opportunities to win through attrition. The deck also features some versatile threats and utility lands to provide additional options and resilience. Overall, the goal is to dismantle the opponent's resources while building up a strong board presence to ultimately come out on top in the long game."
