The deck utilizes efficient mana acceleration with cards like Lion's Eye Diamond and Lotus Petal, while also having access to powerful tutors like Infernal Tutor and Wishclaw Talisman. The protection provided by Veil of Summer and disruption from cards like Thoughtseize allows the deck to navigate through opposing disruption and combo off to victory. The land base includes various fetch lands and utility lands to support the deck's game plan."
