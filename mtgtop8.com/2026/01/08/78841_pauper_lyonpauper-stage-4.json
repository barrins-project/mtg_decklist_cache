The deck focuses on ramping up mana with creatures like Gatecreeper Vine and Overgrown Battlement, while also using cards like Land Grant and Winding Way to help find key combo pieces. By efficiently using creatures like Elves of Deep Shadow and Saruli Caretaker, as well as utilizing support cards like Mesmeric Fiend and Masked Vandal, the deck aims to quickly assemble the combo and win the game."
