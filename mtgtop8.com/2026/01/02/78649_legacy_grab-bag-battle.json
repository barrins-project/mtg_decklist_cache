These cards work in tandem with artifact cards like Trinisphere, Chrome Mox, and Urza's Saga to slow down the opponent's game plan and disrupt their strategy. Karn, the Great Creator serves as a versatile tool to retrieve key artifacts from the sideboard, while Smokestack and Ghost Vacuum provide additional lock-down effects. The deck aims to establish control over the game while continually advancing its own board state."
