By utilizing cards like Guttersnipe, Lava Dart, and Lightning Bolt to target the opponent directly, combined with creatures like Kessig Flamebreather and Voldaren Epicure to apply pressure, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent and win the game before they have a chance to stabilize. Additionally, cards like Faithless Looting and Grab the Prize help to maintain card advantage and ensure a steady stream of threats."
