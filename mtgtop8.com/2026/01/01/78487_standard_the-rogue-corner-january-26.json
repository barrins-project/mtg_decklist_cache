            "notes": "The key concept of this Azorius Aggro deck is to quickly establish board presence and apply pressure on the opponent by playing aggressive creatures like Aang, Swift Savior and Floodpits Drowner. The deck also aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy with cards like Get Lost and No More Lies, while maintaining card advantage through Enduring Curiosity and Meticulous Archive. By combining efficient creatures with powerful spells like Avatar's Wrath and Aang's Iceberg, this deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory through a combination of aggression and control."
