The inclusion of cards like Force of Will, Pithing Needle, and Soul-Guide Lantern further solidifies the deck's ability to disrupt the opponent's strategy and protect its own game plan. Overall, the deck seeks to apply early pressure and maintain control throughout the game."

It also utilizes Sneak Attack and Omniscience for additional ways to put powerful creatures onto the battlefield without paying their mana costs. The deck includes a mix of card draw and counterspells to help protect your combo pieces and disrupt your opponent's game plan. The goal is to overwhelm your opponent with massive creatures and secure the win before they have a chance to react."
