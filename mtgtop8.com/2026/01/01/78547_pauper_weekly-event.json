            "notes": "The main concept of this UR Control deck is to control the board through counterspells and removal spells, while also drawing cards and gaining card advantage with cards like Accumulated Knowledge and Lórien Revealed. The deck also includes burn spells like Lightning Bolt and Skred for additional removal. Augur of Bolas helps with card selection and finding key pieces, while Fling can be used as a finisher. The mana base is built with Snow-Covered lands for synergy with Skred, and includes options for color fixing."
