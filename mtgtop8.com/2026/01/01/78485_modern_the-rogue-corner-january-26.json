            "notes": "This Golgari Aggro deck focuses on quickly deploying cheap creatures like Boggart Trawler and Iridescent Vinelasher to apply pressure on the opponent. Sorin of House Markov and Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose provide additional value and lifegain to sustain the aggro strategy. The deck also includes disruption in the form of Fatal Push, Thoughtseize, and Force of Despair to control the board. With March of Wretched Sorrow and Necrodominance, the deck can quickly close out games by draining the opponent's life total. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm opponents with a combination of aggression and disruption."
