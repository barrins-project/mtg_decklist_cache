The deck utilizes a variety of instant-speed removal spells like Abrade and Lightning Helix to deal with threats on the board, while also packing counterspells like Dispelling Exhale to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Card advantage is gained through cards like Consult the Star Charts and Jeskai Revelation, allowing the player to outvalue their opponent in the long game. Elspeth, Storm Slayer provides a win condition and additional removal, while Marang River Regent and Shiko, Paragon of the Way offer protection and additional value. The deck also includes some land-based ramp with the Verge lands to help reach the higher mana costs of powerful spells like Day of Judgment and Iroh's Demonstration. Overall, the deck aims to control the game and outvalue the opponent in order to secure victory."

The key strategy is to utilize cards such as Bringer of the Last Gift, Broodspinner, and Overlord of the Balemurk to set up powerful combos and overwhelm the opponent with a board full of creatures. By carefully managing resources and timing the reanimation spells correctly, the player can create an unstoppable army of creatures that can quickly turn the tide of the game in their favor."
