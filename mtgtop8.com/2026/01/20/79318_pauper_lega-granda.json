The main win condition is to outvalue the opponent through card advantage and attrition, while using powerful control elements to disrupt their game plan. The inclusion of cards like Squadron Hawk and Sacred Cat help to provide early board presence and potential card advantage, while Lórien Revealed is a versatile card that can provide card selection or card advantage as needed."

With a combination of aggressive creatures like Kessig Flamebreather and Voldaren Epicure, along with direct damage spells like Lightning Bolt and Fireblast, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent before they have a chance to establish their own board presence. The deck also includes card draw and mana acceleration to ensure a consistent stream of threats and burn spells throughout the game."
