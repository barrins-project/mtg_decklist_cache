This allows for combos with Dread Return to bring back powerful creatures early in the game. The deck also utilizes cards like Winding Way and Lead the Stampede to dig for combo pieces efficiently. Overall, the goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a powerful combo before they can set up their own strategy."
