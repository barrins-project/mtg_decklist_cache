This deck focuses on generating mana through creatures like Sagu Wildling and Overgrown Battlement, while also using cards like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way to help find the necessary pieces. The combination of mill, mana ramp, and recursion makes this deck unique and powerful in the Pauper 1 vs 1 format."
