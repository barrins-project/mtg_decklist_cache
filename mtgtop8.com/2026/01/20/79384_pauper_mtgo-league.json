Key cards include Sneaky Snacker and Kessig Flamebreather for early aggression, while cards like Fireblast and Lightning Bolt provide reach to finish off the opponent. The deck's game plan is to apply relentless pressure while maintaining a steady stream of burn spells to close out the game before the opponent can stabilize. It is a fast-paced and explosive deck that aims to win through aggressive tactics and efficient use of burn spells."
