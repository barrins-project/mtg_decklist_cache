By controlling the game and surviving until the late game, you can eventually overwhelm your opponent with powerful spells and finish them off with cards like Combustion Technique and Toph, Hardheaded Teacher."

The key strategy is to use cheap and efficient creatures like Quantum Riddler and Duelist of the Mind to apply early pressure on the opponent. Boomerang Basics and Torch the Tower provide removal options, while Stormchaser's Talent and Fear of Missing Out help increase card advantage and maintain tempo. Multiversal Passage and Riverpyre Verge ensure smooth mana production, allowing for consistent plays. Roaring Furnace / Steaming Sauna and Frostcliff Siege provide additional board presence and damage potential. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent quickly while maintaining control of the board."
