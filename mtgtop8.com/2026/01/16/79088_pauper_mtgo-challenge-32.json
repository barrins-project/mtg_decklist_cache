Card draw spells such as Brainstorm and Thought Scour help maintain card advantage, while cards like Lórien Revealed can both draw cards and provide additional utility. Ultimately, the deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver the opponent through careful resource management."

The deck aims to control the game tempo by constantly filling the graveyard with self-mill cards like Thought Scour and Mental Note while efficiently casting threats like Delver of Secrets and Cryptic Serpent. Lórien Revealed provides additional card advantage, while Sleep of the Dead can stall opponent's creatures to give the deck more time to establish dominance. Overall, the deck aims to win through aggressive plays and efficient spellcasting."
