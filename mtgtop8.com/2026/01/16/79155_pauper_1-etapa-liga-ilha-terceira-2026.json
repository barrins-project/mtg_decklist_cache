With cards like Ancestral Mask, Ethereal Armor, Armadillo Cloak, and Rancor, the creatures become huge and difficult to block or remove. The main strategy is to get an early creature on the board and then continuously pump it up with auras to deal massive damage to the opponent. The deck also includes some protection and removal spells to help maintain board control and keep the pressure on the opponent."
