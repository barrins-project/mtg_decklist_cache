The goal is to assemble a combination of cards that will allow you to cast powerful spells like Ad Nauseam and Tendrils of Agony to win the game in a single turn. This deck also utilizes the Wishclaw Talisman and Burning Wish to search for and retrieve specific cards from your sideboard, providing flexibility and adaptability in different situations."
