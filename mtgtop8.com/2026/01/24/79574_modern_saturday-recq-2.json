It also utilizes cards like Ephemerate and Faithful Mending to protect and recur key pieces. The presence of disruptive elements like Force of Negation and Thoughtseize help control the game and ensure the combo can go off smoothly. The deck aims to create a fast and efficient win condition by rapidly bringing back threats from the graveyard while disrupting the opponent's game plan."
