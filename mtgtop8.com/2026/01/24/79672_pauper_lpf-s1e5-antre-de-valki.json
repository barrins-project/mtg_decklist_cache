By utilizing mana-producing elves like Birchlore Rangers and Priest of Titania, the deck is able to cast multiple creatures early in the game. Lead the Stampede and Distant Melody help to refill the hand with more elves to maintain the pressure. Timberwatch Elf provides a powerful pump effect to enhance the offense while Wellwisher offers some utility in gaining life. Overall, the deck aims to establish a strong board presence and quickly defeat the opponent."
