By deploying low-cost creatures like Novice Inspector and Raffine's Informant early in the game, the deck aims to quickly build a board presence and exert pressure on the opponent. Cards like Thraben Inspector and Battle Screech provide additional value and token generation, while removal spells like Journey to Nowhere help control the opponent's threats. The deck also includes cards like Prismatic Strands to protect its creatures and maintain board advantage."
