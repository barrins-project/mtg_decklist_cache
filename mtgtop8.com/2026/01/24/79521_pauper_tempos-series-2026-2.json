The deck aims to assemble the Urzatron quickly using cards like Expedition Map and Crop Rotation, allowing the player to cast big creatures like Bramble Wurm and Maelstrom Colossus early on. The deck also includes removal spells like Pinnacle Kill-Ship and Candy Trail to control the board and disrupt the opponent's strategy, making it difficult for them to deal with the ramped-up threats."
