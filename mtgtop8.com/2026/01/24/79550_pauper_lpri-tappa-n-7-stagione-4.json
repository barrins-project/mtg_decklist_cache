The deck utilizes cards like Gixian Infiltrator and Krark-Clan Shaman to apply pressure, while also using cards like Cleansing Wildfire and Nihil Spellbomb to disrupt the opponent's strategy. The deck also has tools like Refurbished Familiar and Twisted Landscape to help ensure consistent and smooth gameplay. Overall, the goal is to outpace and outmaneuver the opponent to secure a victory."
