By making use of small creatures like Gixian Infiltrator and Refurbished Familiar, coupled with removal spells like Cast Down and Toxin Analysis, the deck aims to quickly reduce the opponent's life total. Additionally, cards like Krark-Clan Shaman and Fanatical Offering provide additional value by either dealing damage or sacrificing creatures for benefits. By maintaining a steady flow of threats and disruption, the deck aims to dominate the battlefield and secure a swift victory."
