Opalescence can turn all enchantments, including ones like Parallax Wave, into powerful threats. The deck also includes removal and stall tactics with cards like Swords to Plowshares and Solitary Confinement. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a well-established enchantment board presence."

By utilizing cards like Swords to Plowshares, Counterspell, and Wrath of God, the deck aims to keep the opponent's board clear while maintaining card advantage through cards such as Fact or Fiction and Standstill. The inclusion of lands like Mishra's Factory and Faerie Conclave provides additional threats while also being able to activate abilities to further control the battlefield."
