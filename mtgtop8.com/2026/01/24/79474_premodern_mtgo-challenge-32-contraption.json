The deck includes powerful cards like Survival of the Fittest for tutoring key creatures, Tangle Wire for disruption, and Deranged Hermit for a strong finisher. By utilizing cards like Wirewood Symbiote for protection and Quirion Ranger for untapping lands, this deck aims to overwhelm your opponent with a flood of Elves and end the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
