By combining these defenders with cards like Freed from the Real and Galvanic Alchemist, the deck can produce infinite mana to cast powerful spells or activate abilities. Additionally, cards like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help to ensure card advantage and maintain a steady flow of creatures to protect the player while setting up the combo."
