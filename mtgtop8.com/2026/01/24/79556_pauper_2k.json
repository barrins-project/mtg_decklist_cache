The key strategy involves using cheap creatures like God-Pharaoh's Faithful and Sunscape Familiar to gain incremental advantage, while recycling key spells with Archaeomancer and Ephemerate. Mulldrifter and Sea Gate Oracle provide card draw and selection, while Murmuring Mystic generates tokens. Counterspells like Negate and Prohibit disrupt the opponent's game plan, while bounce spells like Snap and Ghostly Flicker provide tempo advantage. Lórien Revealed boosts the effectiveness of card draw spells, while Contaminated Landscape helps fix mana."

By utilizing cards like Burning-Tree Emissary and Goblin Bushwhacker to quickly build a board presence, supported by efficient removal like Galvanic Blast and Lightning Bolt, the deck aims to finish off the opponent quickly before they can stabilize. The addition of Rally at the Hornburg provides a way to refill the board if needed, while cards like Reckless Impulse offer card advantage. Overall, the deck is designed to overwhelm the opponent with aggressive plays and efficient damage output."
