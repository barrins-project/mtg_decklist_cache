By utilizing cards like Faerie Miscreant, Spellstutter Sprite, and Ninja of the Deep Hours, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's plans and chip away at their life total efficiently. The inclusion of counterspells like Counterspell and Force Spike helps to protect the creatures on the board and push through damage. Overall, the deck seeks to overwhelm the opponent with a flurry of quick, evasive creatures and disruptive spells."
