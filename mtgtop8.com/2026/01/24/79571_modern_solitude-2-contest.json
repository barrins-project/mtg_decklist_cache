By using cards like Unearth and Persist to bring back creatures like Archon of Cruelty and Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with threats. The inclusion of disruptive cards like Magus of the Moon and Thoughtseize helps to control the game while setting up the combo. The key strategy is to quickly fill the graveyard with powerful creatures and then bring them back into play for a dominating board presence."
