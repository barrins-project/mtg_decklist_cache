Moon-Circuit Hacker and Ninja of the Deep Hours provide card advantage and tempo plays, while Spellstutter Sprite and Force Spike disrupt the opponent's game plan. The inclusion of Snap allows for both removal and tempo advantage. Overall, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with efficient creatures, disruption, and card advantage to secure a quick victory."
