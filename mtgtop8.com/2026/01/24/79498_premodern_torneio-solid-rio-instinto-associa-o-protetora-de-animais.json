The goal is to disrupt the opponent's game plan with cards like Cabal Therapy and Duress, while also being able to handle threats with cards like Smother and Pernicious Deed. The deck also has a strong recursive element with cards like Recurring Nightmare, allowing for powerful late-game plays. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue the opponent and grind out a win through attrition."
