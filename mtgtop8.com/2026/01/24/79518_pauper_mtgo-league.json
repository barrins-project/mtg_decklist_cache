The deck also uses artifacts like Thoughtcast and Galvanic Blast to dig for necessary cards and remove threats, while utilizing sacrifice outlets like Makeshift Munitions and Fanatical Offering to gain additional value from sacrificing artifacts. Nihil Spellbomb provides graveyard hate while Reckoner's Bargain offers additional card draw. Overall, the strategy revolves around utilizing synergy between artifacts and creatures to rapidly push for damage and control the board."
