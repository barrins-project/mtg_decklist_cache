The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of efficient creatures and powerful spells, eventually leading to a strong finish with a card like Craterhoof Behemoth. Additionally, the deck utilizes Simic colors to take advantage of both creature buffs and card draw, creating a versatile and dynamic strategy in the Aggro archetype."
