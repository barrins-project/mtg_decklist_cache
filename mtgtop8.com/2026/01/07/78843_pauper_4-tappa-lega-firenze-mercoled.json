The deck also utilizes artifacts like Expedition Map and Prophetic Prism for card draw and mana fixing. Foundry Inspector helps reduce the cost of artifacts, while Nihil Spellbomb disrupts opponent's graveyard strategies. Control elements like Candy Trail, Black Mage's Rod, and Fanatical Offering provide removal and disruption, while Weather the Storm offers some lifegain. Overall, the deck aims to outvalue and overwhelm the opponent with big threats and control elements."
