The deck also focuses on generating mana efficiently with cards like Pentad Prism and Manamorphose. Weather the Storm and Contentious Plan help to protect yourself while advancing your game plan. Lórien Revealed and Vivisurgeon's Insight provide card advantage and the ability to draw into your combo pieces. Overall, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with poison counters and finish them off with a powerful poison storm."
