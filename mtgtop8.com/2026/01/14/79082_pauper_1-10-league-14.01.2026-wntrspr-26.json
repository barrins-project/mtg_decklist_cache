The deck aims to put constant pressure on the opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize. Key cards such as Goblin Bushwhacker and Rally at the Hornburg help to boost the team and push for lethal damage. The strategy revolves around fast aggression and efficient removal to secure victory."
