It also utilizes bounce effects like Kor Skyfisher to reuse enter-the-battlefield abilities of creatures like Thraben Inspector. The deck includes a mix of aggressive creatures like Spider-Man, Web-Slinger and flyers like Eagles of the North for added versatility. Support cards like Prismatic Strands and Guardians' Pledge enhance the board presence and protect the creatures. Overall, the goal is to maintain pressure and outpace the opponent with a swarm of efficient creatures."
