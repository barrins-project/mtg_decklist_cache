The deck includes cards like Foundry Inspector and Pactdoll Terror to disrupt the opponent, while also utilizing artifacts like Ichor Wellspring and Prophetic Prism to draw cards and generate mana. The goal is to assemble the Urzatron quickly and overwhelm the opponent with powerful spells like Eviscerator's Insight. Additionally, key cards like Candy Trail provide additional removal and disruption to control the pace of the game."
