The inclusion of versatile spells like Daze and Brazen Borrower further enhances the deck's ability to dictate the pace of the game and keep the opponent on the back foot. Overall, the deck focuses on staying ahead in the game through a combination of aggression and disruption."

It focuses on card selection through cantrips like Ponder and Brainstorm, countering threats with Force of Will and Stifle, and managing opponent's resources with Wasteland. The deck can generate card advantage through Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student and Meticulous Archive, while also having removal options in Swords to Plowshares. Overall, the deck aims to control the game tempo, disrupt opponents, and eventually win through efficient threats like Murktide Regent."
