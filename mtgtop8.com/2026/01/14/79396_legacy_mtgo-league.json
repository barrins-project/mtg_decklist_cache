By using cards like Urza's Saga, Mox Opal, and Mishra's Bauble, the deck can generate mana efficiently and draw cards to maintain pressure. Emry, Lurker of the Loch and Pinnacle Emissary provide recurring value, while cards like Chalice of the Void and Force of Will help disrupt opposing strategies. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with fast artifact-based aggression while controlling the game with counter spells and disruptive artifacts."

The deck focuses on disrupting the opponent's game plan, while gradually building up its own resources. Murktide Regent serves as a powerful threat while cards like Fatal Push and Murderous Cut deal with opposing creatures. Wasteland and Orcish Bowmasters help to further disrupt the opponent's mana base, while cards like Brainstorm and Ponder help to dig for key pieces. Ultimately, the goal is to outlast the opponent and take control of the game."
