The inclusion of disruptive cards like Force of Will and Sink into Stupor also helps to disrupt the opponent's game plan, allowing the deck to maintain its aggressive momentum."

By controlling the game tempo with cards like Stifle and Force of Will, and keeping the board clear with Swords to Plowshares, the deck aims to outvalue and outlast the opponent to eventually win the game through card advantage and powerful planeswalkers. The deck's key strength lies in its ability to control the board and disrupt the opponent's plans while generating card advantage and threats of its own."
