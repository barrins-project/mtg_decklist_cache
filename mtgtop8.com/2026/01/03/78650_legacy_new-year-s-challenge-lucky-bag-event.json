By assembling various pieces such as Voltaic Key and Grim Monolith, the deck can generate massive amounts of mana to play multiple threats in a single turn. The deck also utilizes disruptive elements like Pithing Needle and Kozilek's Command to disrupt the opponent's game plan. With Urza's Saga providing additional artifact synergies, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a combination of powerful threats and disruption."

The deck also includes protection spells like Pact of Negation and disruption cards like Cabal Therapy to help ensure the combo resolves successfully.

The deck aims to quickly deploy threats, disrupt the opponent's game plan, and overwhelm them with a combination of creatures and removal spells to secure victory in the Legacy 1 vs 1 format."
