            "notes": "The main focus of this deck is to quickly deal damage to the opponent using aggressive creatures and burn spells. The synergy between cards like Voldaren Epicure and Sneaky Snacker allows for a fast and efficient strategy. Using cards like Kessig Flamebreather and Guttersnipe to add additional damage each turn can overwhelm the opponent. Faithless Looting helps cycle through the deck for key cards, while Fireblast and Lightning Bolt provide direct damage to finish off the opponent. Grab the Prize and Highway Robbery offer additional ways to gain advantage and close out the game."
