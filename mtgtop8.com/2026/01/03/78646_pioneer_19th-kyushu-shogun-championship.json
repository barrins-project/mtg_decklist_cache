With a low curve and plenty of cheap spells, the key strategy is to play creatures like Soul-Scar Mage and Monastery Swiftspear early to apply pressure, while using burn spells like Burst Lightning and Wizard's Lightning to finish off the opponent. The deck also utilizes cards like Kumano Faces Kakkazan and Monstrous Rage to further increase damage output and close out games efficiently."
