Alms of the Vein and Vampire's Kiss provide additional life gain to help sustain the aggro strategy.

Bojuka Bog is included for graveyard hate, while Rakdos Carnarium provides additional card advantage."

By utilizing low-cost creatures and burn spells like Chain Lightning, Goblin Bushwhacker, and Lightning Bolt, along with ways to generate extra mana like Burning-Tree Emissary and Great Furnace, the deck can apply pressure early on. The inclusion of cards like Reckless Impulse and Rally at the Hornburg helps to maintain card advantage and maintain a steady stream of threats. Overall, the deck focuses on speed and efficiency in dealing damage to the opponent."
