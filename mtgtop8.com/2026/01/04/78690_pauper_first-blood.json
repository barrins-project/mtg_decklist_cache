By utilizing faeries and ninjas, the deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain tempo throughout the game. Counterspells and card draw provide control and consistency, while the snow-covered islands help enable certain synergies within the deck. Overall, the strategy of this deck is to outpace the opponent and close out the game before they have a chance to stabilize."
