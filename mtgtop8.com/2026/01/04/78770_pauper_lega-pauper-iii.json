It includes a mix of flying creatures, card drawing ability, and protection spells to maintain board presence and apply pressure early on. The goal is to flood the board with cheap creatures and then use cards like Guardians' Pledge and Battle Screech to pump them up for a deadly swing. The mana base is kept simple with mostly Plains to ensure consistent casting of creatures and spells."

It utilizes Delver of Secrets and Tolarian Terror as early threats, along with Cryptic Serpent as a powerful finisher. The deck also incorporates card draw and filtering to maintain consistency and find key pieces. The mana base includes utility lands like Contaminated Aquifer and Bojuka Bog to support the game plan. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's strategy while quickly closing out the game with powerful threats."
