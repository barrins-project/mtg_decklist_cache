The deck also includes cards like Sleight of Hand and Opt to help ensure consistent draws and maximize the chances of bringing back Arclight Phoenix."

The deck aims to apply pressure on the opponent and finish the game quickly while also disrupting the opponent's game plan with spells like Academic Dispute and Boomerang Basics. The inclusion of cards like Soul-Scar Mage and Stormchaser's Talent help with maintaining card advantage and supporting aggressive plays."
