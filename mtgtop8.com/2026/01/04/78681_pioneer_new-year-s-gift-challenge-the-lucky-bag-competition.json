The deck focuses on efficiently casting creatures like Archon of Emeria and Skyclave Apparition to disrupt the opponent's game plan while maintaining pressure with Thalia, Guardian of Thraben and Aven Interrupter. Collected Company allows for explosive creature plays, while Enduring Innocence and Ouroboroid provide resilient threats. Elspeth, Storm Slayer serves as a finisher, supported by land choices that ensure consistent mana production for a smooth aggro strategy."
