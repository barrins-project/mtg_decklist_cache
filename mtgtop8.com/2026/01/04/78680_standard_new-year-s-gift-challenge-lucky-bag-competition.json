By using mana dorks like Llanowar Elves and ramping into powerful creatures like Craterhoof Behemoth, the deck aims to put pressure on the opponent early on. With the support of cards like Nature's Rhythm and Frostcliff Siege, the deck can also disrupt the opponent's game plan and maintain its advantage. The deck's strategy is focused on establishing a strong board presence and utilizing creature synergies to secure victory."
