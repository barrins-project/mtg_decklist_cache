With cards like Lightning Bolt and Unholy Heat for removal, and powerful creatures like Overlord of the Balemurk and Detective's Phoenix to apply pressure, the deck aims to quickly overwhelm the opponent with a fast and efficient aggro strategy. Additionally, the deck includes disruptive elements like Vampire Hexmage and Orcish Bowmasters to disrupt the opponent's game plan."

The deck focuses on a high number of burn spells such as Lightning Bolt, Lava Spike, and Rift Bolt, as well as efficient creatures like Monastery Swiftspear and Chandra's Incinerator. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent with constant pressure and direct damage, taking advantage of its aggressive nature and ability to close out games before the opponent has a chance to stabilize."
