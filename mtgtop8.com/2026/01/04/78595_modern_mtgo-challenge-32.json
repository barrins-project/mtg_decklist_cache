The deck also includes cards like Mishra's Bauble and Expressive Iteration to help dig for more threats. Dragon's Rage Channeler and Monastery Swiftspear are key creatures that benefit from playing multiple spells in one turn. The deck aims to apply early pressure and close out the game before the opponent can stabilize, with cards like Violent Urge and Unholy Heat to help push through for that final damage."

This enables the player to bring back powerful creatures like Arclight Phoenix and Creeping Chill from the graveyard to the battlefield. By utilizing cards like Burning Inquiry and Thundering Falls to draw and discard cards, the player can establish a strong board presence and overwhelm the opponent. This deck focuses on quickly assembling powerful combinations of cards to win the game in a fast and explosive manner."
