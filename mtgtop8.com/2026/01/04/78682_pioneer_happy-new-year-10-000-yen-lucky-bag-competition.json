It utilizes powerful planeswalkers like Teferi, Hero of Dominaria and Elspeth, Storm's Slayer to gain incremental advantages. The mana base allows for flexibility and consistency in casting spells, with access to various colors. Overall, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's game plan, outvalue them through card advantage, and eventually win through powerful threats and overwhelming control."
