            "notes": "The main focus of this Selesnya Aggro deck is to quickly build up a strong board presence with efficient creatures like Badgermole Cub and Llanowar Elves, while utilizing cards like Mightform Harmonizer and Earthbender Ascension to buff them up and overwhelm the opponent. Sazh's Chocobo provides additional aggression, while Mossborn Hydra offers a resilient threat. The deck also includes Esper Origins for card advantage and disruption, as well as a suite of lands to ensure consistent mana sources. Overall, this deck aims to apply early pressure and maintain control of the battlefield to secure a swift victory."
