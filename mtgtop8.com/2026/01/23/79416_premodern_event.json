By utilizing cards like Goblin Lackey to cheat out powerful creatures and Goblin Warchief to reduce costs, the deck aims to flood the board with fast and efficient threats like Goblin Piledriver and Siege-Gang Commander. With a mix of burn spells like Gempalm Incinerator and Mogg Fanatic, the deck can control the board while maintaining pressure. The inclusion of land destruction cards like Wasteland and Rishadan Port helps disrupt the opponent's mana base and secure victory through aggression."
