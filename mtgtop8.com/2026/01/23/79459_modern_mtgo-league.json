The deck also features control elements such as Kozilek's Command and Malevolent Rumble to disrupt the opponent's game plan. Additionally, cards like Sowing Mycospawn and Writhing Chrysalis provide additional value and board presence. With a mix of ramp, control, and powerful creatures, this deck aims to overwhelm the opponent and secure victory."
