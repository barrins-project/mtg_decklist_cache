Overall, the strategy of this deck is to efficiently assemble its combo pieces and win the game before the opponent can effectively respond."

By utilizing cards like Lotus Bloom and Whir of Invention to search for combo pieces like Goblin Charbelcher and Thundertrap Trainer, the deck aims to assemble a winning combination quickly and efficiently. Spell disruption and control elements like Disrupting Shoal and Stern Scolding are used to protect the combo pieces and prevent opponents from interfering with the game plan. The deck focuses on generating value through synergy between its cards and executing a powerful win condition without the need for traditional land cards."
