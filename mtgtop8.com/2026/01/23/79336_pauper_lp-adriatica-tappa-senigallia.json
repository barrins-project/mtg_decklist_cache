The key strategy is to ramp up mana using cards like Axebane Guardian and Overgrown Battlement, then use Freed from the Real or Galvanic Alchemist to untap a wall and produce infinite mana. This combo can be used to cast powerful spells like Valakut Invoker or generate card advantage with Lead the Stampede. The deck also includes card draw and recursion to ensure consistency and resilience."
