The deck aims to control the board with removal spells like Journey to Nowhere and Lightning Bolt, while also gaining life with cards like Radiant Fountain and Kabira Crossroads. The creatures in the deck have strong synergy with one another, allowing for quick attacks and easy board presence. The overall strategy is to overwhelm the opponent with a mix of creatures and burn spells, while also gaining incremental advantages with lifegain and card advantage."
