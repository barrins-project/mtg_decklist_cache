The deck also includes combat tricks like Apostle's Blessing, Mutagenic Growth, and Assault Strobe to pump up these creatures and close out games. In addition, it includes cantrips like Ponder and Manamorphose to help dig for the necessary combo pieces. The deck also includes a few evasion spells like Slip Through Space and Escape Tunnel to get damage through."
