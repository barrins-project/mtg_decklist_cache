The strategy includes disrupting the opponent's hand with cards like Cabal Therapy and Duress, while also destroying their board with Pernicious Deed. The deck also has a recursion element with Recurring Nightmare and Volrath's Stronghold, allowing for constant pressure and advantage. Overall, the deck aims to grind out victories by outvaluing the opponent and controlling the game until it can secure a win."
