By swarming the battlefield with small creatures like Novice Inspector and Kor Skyfisher, the player can quickly apply pressure and chip away at the opponent's life total. Support cards like Guardians' Pledge and Battle Screech help boost the team's power and toughness, while Prismatic Strands can provide protection against removal spells. The goal is to establish an early advantage and outpace the opponent before they can stabilize."
