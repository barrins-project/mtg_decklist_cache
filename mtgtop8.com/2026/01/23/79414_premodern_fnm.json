Mother of Runes provides protection and evasion, while removal spells like Swords to Plowshares and Disenchant help clear the way. The deck aims to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures and maintain pressure throughout the game, ultimately securing victory through sheer speed and efficiency."
