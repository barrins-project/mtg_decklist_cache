By combining fast creatures like Hired Claw and Fanatical Firebrand with direct damage spells like Shock and Lightning Strike, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent early in the game. Cards like Nova Hellkite and Tersa Lightshatter provide additional power and reach, allowing for a swift victory before the opponent can stabilize. The deck focuses on speed, efficiency, and consistent damage output to win the game."
