The combo relies on sacrificing creatures for value and using reanimation effects to overwhelm the opponent with a swarm of creatures. Key cards like Lotleth Giant and Scrapwork Mutt can deal massive damage to the opponent once they are brought back from the graveyard. The deck also utilizes Momentary Blink to flicker creatures for additional value."

The inclusion of recursion with cards like Heritage Reclamation and Ichor Wellspring adds consistency to the deck, while also disrupting the opponent with Nihil Spellbomb. The land base is optimized for consistency and mana ramp with Golgari Rot Farm and Bojuka Bog."
