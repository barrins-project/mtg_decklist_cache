The deck also includes cards like Gatecreeper Vine and Quirion Ranger to help with ramp and fixing mana, while cards like Lead the Stampede and Winding Way help you refill your hand with creatures. Additionally, cards like Malevolent Rumble and Masked Vandal provide removal and disruption against your opponent."
