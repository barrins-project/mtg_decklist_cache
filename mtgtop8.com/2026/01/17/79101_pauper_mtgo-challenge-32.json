Masked Vandal provides flexibility for dealing with artifacts/enchantments, while Timberwatch Elf pumps up your other creatures. Quirion Ranger allows for additional mana generation and Priest of Titania can generate a lot of mana with all the Elves in the deck. Lead the Stampede helps refill your hand and Thermokarst/Mwonvuli Acid-Moss disrupt your opponent's mana base. The Gingerbread Cabin is a utility land that can provide some additional life gain."

The deck aims to stall the game with cards like Crypt Rats and Defile, while also generating card advantage with Ichor Wellspring and Eviscerator's Insight. Khalni Garden and Golgari Rot Farm help stabilize the board, while cards like Accursed Marauder and Troll of Khazad-dûm provide threats that can deal with opposing creatures. Overall, the deck seeks to outvalue the opponent and control the game until victory."
