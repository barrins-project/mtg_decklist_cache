By bouncing creatures like Dream Stalker and Kor Skyfisher, as well as enchantments like Journey to Nowhere and Reality Acid, the deck aims to disrupt the opponent's board presence while gaining incremental advantage. Additionally, the deck includes cards like Spreading Seas and Omen of the Sea to provide card selection and disruption. Overall, the key concept is to out-value the opponent through consistent control and manipulation of the battlefield."
