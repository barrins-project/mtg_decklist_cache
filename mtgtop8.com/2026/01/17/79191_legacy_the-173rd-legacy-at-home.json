It also utilizes powerful creatures like Stoneforge Mystic and Phelia, Exuberant Shepherd to apply pressure and generate advantage. Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student provides card draw and Murktide Regent serves as a big threat to close out the game. The inclusion of equipment like Batterskull and Meteor Sword enhances the deck's versatility and ability to deal with different situations. The mana base is efficient and includes cards like Wasteland and Karakas for added disruption."
