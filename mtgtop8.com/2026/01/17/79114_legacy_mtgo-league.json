The deck also includes cards like Force of Will and Orim's Chant to protect your combo pieces, while utilizing cards like Brainstorm and Ponder to find your combo pieces quickly. The deck also includes utility cards like Swords to Plowshares for removal and Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student for card draw and manipulation. The key strategy is to quickly assemble your combo while disrupting your opponent's game plan."
