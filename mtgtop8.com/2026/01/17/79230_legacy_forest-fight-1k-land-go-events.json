Tamiyo, Inquisitive Student and Voice of Victory provide additional card draw and protection, while Thassa's Oracle acts as a win condition. The deck is supported by various control cards such as Force of Will and Swords to Plowshares to disrupt opponents. The inclusion of Urza's Saga allows for tutor neglection of key combo pieces, making the deck efficient and deadly in Legacy matchups."
