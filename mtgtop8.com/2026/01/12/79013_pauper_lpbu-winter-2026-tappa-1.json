The deck takes advantage of the affinity mechanic to reduce the cost of artifacts and generate card advantage using cards like Thoughtcast and Ichor Wellspring. It also includes removal spells like Galvanic Blast to deal with threats and disrupt the opponent's game plan. Overall, the deck aims to efficiently use its resources to apply early pressure and maintain a strong board presence throughout the game."
