The deck focuses on blink effects to maximize the value of entering the battlefield abilities, and to slowly grind out card advantage and board control. With a mix of card draw, counterspells, and flicker effects, this deck aims to outlast and outmaneuver opponents in a grindy, attrition-based match."
