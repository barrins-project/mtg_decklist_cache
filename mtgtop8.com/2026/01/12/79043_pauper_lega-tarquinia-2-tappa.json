By utilizing a combination of aggressive creatures like Gixian Infiltrator and Krark-Clan Shaman, along with recursion effects like Pulse of Murasa and Ichor Wellspring, the deck aims to overwhelm the opponent before they can establish a board presence. Additionally, the deck includes versatile removal options like Cast Down and Cleansing Wildfire to deal with threats and disrupt the opponent's mana base."
