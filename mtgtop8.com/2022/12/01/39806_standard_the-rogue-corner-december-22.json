The deck focuses on utilizing cards like Blast Zone and Hall of Tagsin to control the board while also generating value with cards like Fable of the Mirror-Breaker and Karn, Living Legacy. Overall, the deck aims to maintain control of the game through a combination of removal spells, creature threats, and card advantage, ultimately leading to victory through smart decision-making and resource management."
