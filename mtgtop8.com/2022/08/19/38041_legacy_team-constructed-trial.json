The key strategy involves comboing off by casting reanimation spells like Reanimate and Exhume to bring back these creatures early in the game, overwhelming the opponent. The deck also includes disruption elements like Thoughtseize and Unmask to protect the combo and interacts with the opponent's hand. The goal is to cheat out big threats and win the game before the opponent can stabilize."
