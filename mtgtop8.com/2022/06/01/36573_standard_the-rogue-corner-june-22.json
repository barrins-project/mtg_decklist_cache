            "notes": "The key concept of this deck is to maintain control over the game by utilizing a combination of removal spells, counterspells, and board wipes. The deck focuses on establishing a solid mana base to support its powerful creatures, such as Goldspan Dragon and Velomachus Lorehold. It also includes a mix of burn spells and card draw to maintain card advantage and deal with threats. Additionally, the deck features some alternate win conditions, like Smoldering Egg and Starnheim Unleashed, to provide versatility and unpredictability. The overall strategy is to control the board and gradually outvalue the opponent."
